    with your pills, crush them in a grinder, and put powder into a large washed 
    out gatorade jug. make sure you wash with distilled water only. 1000 60mg 
    pills, will yield 1 ounce of honey, at a 50% return. Next, add distilled water 
    to the powder, and shake....let settle for a minute or two, and siphon off 
    the water. Repeat steps, until you can't taste the pseudo anymore. The pseudo 
    has a bitter taste to it.. Now, make sure that you filter the liquid through 
    coffee filters until the liquid is completely clear. When you have achieved 
    this, boil it down til it's real low and put on medium heat.....continue cooking 
    it down, until your pseudo starts drying out, then finish with a blow dryer... 
    Remember not to burn your pseudo.... Scrape the powder into a small pile, 
    and put into another washed out Gatorade jug. Then add Methanol.... You'll 
    notice that a binder comes out in the methanol, but was clear in the water. 
    Siphon, and filter, til this is clear......I use about 8 bottles of Heet brand 
    methanol for every 4000 pills worth of powder. Again, filter til clear, then 
    put on stove and boil.....this time, use a fan to blow on the top of your 
    glass bowl to make sure it doesn't spill over and catch fire.....Do the same 
    thing that you did with the first batch, low heat, and blow dry.....Now you'll 
    have pure Pseudo.....The reason for the water pull, is to make sure you remove 
    all the wax, because the wax is completely soluble in methanol. I forgot to 
    mention, that when using the water, make sure it is ICE cold. Then, the methanol 
    will bring out the last binder which is soluble in water. Step 2 coming up, 
    but I have to run.</font></p>

    ..... okay, now you should have your pseudo ready to go......just remember 
    the ratios that I give you..okay...now to make the push/pull......the best 
    thing about it, is the fact that since it's enclosed, there is no smell and 
    the process only takes an hour or so.......take 2 2.5 gallon plastic gas cans....tape 
    them together with duct tape , so that the can sit side by side. Next, take 
    the nozzles from the the gas cans and attach them together.....usually, I 
    cut the end off of one, and stick the other into it. then I hot glue them 
    together, to seal them. so then you attach them back onto the cans. this allows 
    water from one side, to enter into the other side. Make sure that you screw 
    them back on tight, and that your seal is air tight, so that when you stand 
    them up on their ends, water and/or air does not leak out......Next, take 
    the can on the right side and attach a clear pvc tubing onto the air inlet 
    of the gas can. This you use to run into a sink, or shower, or empty container, 
    cuz sometimes iodine water will get pushed out from the reaction. Make sure 
    you use a hose clamp and hot glue to secure it tightly. Next, take the can 
    on the left, and attach a clear, BRAIDED, hose to the air inlet. This is the 
    hose that will be attached to the stopper on the flask. It has to be braided, 
    so that it won't collapse when the heat and pressure build up on the final 
    rxn phase. Make sure that you use a hose clamp, and some hot glue to attach, 
    cuz you don't want it to come loose. once this is down, fill one of the gas 
    with 2 1/4 gallons of distilled water. Then stand the gas cans on end, so 
    that the air inlets are up, and the U connection you made with the spouts 
    are on the bottom. Attaching the hose to the stopper, can be a bit tricky. 
    I use a threaded pvc connector. PVC won't deteriorate from the acids, or the 
    heat. There's a special name for the type of connector I use, so it would 
    be best if I go find out what it is and let you know, cuz the way it's threaded, 
    it won't get pushed out of the stopper. You can build this setup for around 
    30 american dollars from parts at home depot. I shall return later with the 
    name. Anyways, after you've connected the hose to the stopper, you're almost 
    ready to go. The reason you have distilled water in the cans, is so that you 
    can create a pressure. The push comes from the contents forcing out oxygen, 
    and the pull comes from a complete hydrogen state, and after the final rxn, 
    it tries to "breathe" back in oxygen. Use distilled water, cuz sometimes the 
    pull is so hard, that it actually sucks water, back into the flask. Back soon 
    with step 3.</font></p>

  <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">....to 
    answer a couple questions real quick, fzr96.....it shouldn't have cooked for 
    4 hours......only about 1 to 1 1/2 hours......and if it never pulled, then 
    it was never done........Here, this might help answer the questions...... 
    I use a 4000ml vacuum, or filter flask, cuz it has a nipple on the side. I 
    attach a clear hose to this nipple, with a hose clamp, and pinch the hose 
    closed with a pair of vise grips. Then I'm ready to get started. Here's the 
    ratio..... take whatever amount of E you have, and match it with I. Then divide 
    the amount of E you have, and that's how much R you need to use. My teacher 
    told me though, that if you were to make less than an ounce of honey, you 
    have to use half the amount of R, instead of 1/3. I don't know though, cuz 
    I've never done less than 4 ounces. So, if it's 4 ounces, i should have 240 
    grams E, 240 grams I, and 80 grams of R. Take the flask, and first dump in 
    the R. Then, dump in the E. Add 3 small capfuls of distilled water. If you're 
    using re-used R, then add a small bump of hydrogen peroxide. Okay, now this 
    part is the best. Add in the I, but be sure to hurry up and stopper the flask. 
    Then use duct tape to wrap around the stopper and neck of flask, to ensure 
    it doesn't pop off on you. Now, pick up the flask and stir the contents. Sometimes 
    it's quick, and sometimes it's not, but the contents inside should start getting 
    liquidy. If it happens quick, the contents will appear to start to grow. Shake 
    more, in order to calm it down, cuz you don't want a fast reaction. You should 
    notice that the water is pushing, and air maybe coming out the right side 
    gas can. Keep stirring and shaking till the entire contents are liquidy. If 
    you look inside the flask, you'll notice tiny little sprinkles everywhere 
    in the mix. This is caused by the I reacting with the R, and creating Hydriodic 
    acid. Keep your eye on it. You'll notice that at first, you have to stir the 
    contents to calm it down. Then after about 15 minutes, it calms down on its 
    own. Then, you have to stir to keep the reaction going. Let this stirring 
    go on for about half an hour or so. Then, get a large stainless steel stock 
    pot, and one of those portable electric stoves. Make sure you use the low 
    burning side.... I went ahead and tested my reaction heat by getting a candy 
    thermometer, and placing the stock pot on the stove and turning it on, I've 
    noticed that you don't ever want your heat to get higher than 180 degrees, 
    and that you should start cooking at 150 degrees... Test your stove out before 
    you cook, and look at the dial on the stove, as to where the certain degrees 
    are. Now, place the stock pot on the stove, at 150 degrees, and place the 
    flask in the pot. Pick up the flask every few minutes and keep stirring, replacing 
    the flask back in the pot. After about half an hour of this, (making it 1 
    hour total cook time), turn up the heat to 180 degrees and keep the stirring 
    process up. You'll notice that the contents will get real liquidy, and a yellow 
    film will be inside. The mix will look like it wants to literally grow inside 
    the flask. After a few more shakes, let it go, you'll notice that more air 
    and water will get pushed out of the gas can and the reaction will get violent. 
    At this stage, I usually throw a towel over the top of the flask, cuz I've 
    had accidents before, like the hose coming out of the stopper and contents 
    get sprayed everywhere. When the push/pull is a rockin away, then unplug the 
    stove and let it go. When the pushing has stopped, check the flask. The contents 
    should have grown, and filled the entire flask, and a swirling green/white 
    smoke should fill the flask. If this didn't happen, then it's not done. Plug 
    back in the stove, and let it go. This final reaction, is what turns your 
    E into Honey. What happens, is the contents reach a totally hydrogen state. 
    The last of the I has turned into Hydriodic acid and all the oxygen gets pushed 
    out of the flask. This is where you get the pull from...Cuz the hydrogen state 
    combined with heat, creates a pressurized vacuum state. After this final reaction 
    has happened, let the flask cool down, and every 2 minutes, stir the contents. 
    You do this, because when you stir up the contents, you make sure that more 
    E gets turned into Honey. Then when the flask has cooled down to a warm state, 
    keep the nipple hose pinched, and release the vice grips. Place a funnel into 
    the hose, and add distilled water to the funnel, then unpinch the hose and 
    let the water into the flask. Let air get in through the hose cuz if you don't, 
    then as soon as the water hits the inside of the flask, the vacuum will pick 
    up and suck water from the push/ pull. Add more distilled water and remove 
    the duct tape and stopper. Shake the flask around, and pour the contents into 
    a heavy visionware bowl. Add more distilled water to the flask, to clean it 
    out, and add to the visionware. Next, place bowl on the stove, and put on 
    high heat. Get a plastic spoon, and wash with distilled water, to use to stir 
    the mix. Place a fan next to the stove to use to cool the bowl down. Stir 
    the contents to a boil, and remove from heat. Turn the fan on, onto the bowl, 
    and let cool down a bit. You'll notice that all of your R has dropped to the 
    bottom of the bowl, and it's ready to filter. You should have a golden colored 
    liquid. Filter, until all the R is out of the liquid, and place into a rubbermaid 
    "server" jug. I'll be back with the rest in a bit........THE FINAL STEPS</font></p>

    STEPS>>>>>>>okay boys and ghouls, yes, this is the most important part, and 
    if you follow everything right, you won't even need to wash the shit......trust 
    me, my honey has never needed a washing YET!.....almost never leaves a residue 
    in the pipe.....trust me... where i live.....i'm just about number one in 
    quality......and i'll be chatting to TOAST about pics.............okay........ 
    put the yellow colored liquid into the rubbermaid server jug from wal-mart..... 
    this is acid/honey water.......put in a small layer of ice (bag of ice bought 
    from any store, cuz it's allllll distilled), then add an equal portion of 
    Colemans fuel..... if you don't use ice, you're going to get a volcano eruption 
    of lye/acid/colemans all over the place.......when the lye hits the acid, 
    it'll heat up and create alot of pressure......the ice keeps this from happening, 
    until you shake up the container.. next, add about 1/4 can of Red Devil Lye... 
    in mine, it takes about a 1/2 can...... but you don't want to overkill the 
    lye or you'll lose everything.......now screw on the pop-top lid, and shake, 
    with small towel over the top....just in case of leakage.... the jug should 
    heat up and expand.....let settle for a second, and undo the pop-top to let 
    out pressure, close, and repeat...... add more lye as you go along, until 
    you get a very strong <A HREF="catpiss.html">cat urine/ammonia smell</A>..... when your nostrils have 
    received this little message, it's time to let the mix settle, and siphon........take 
    a large gatorade bottle, and poke a hole in the screw top.... next, wash out 
    the bottle, and cap thoroughly, using distilled water........ next, siphon 
    the colemans, into a filtered funnel, into the gatorade bottle.......now, 
    you should have one gatorade bottle, with honey/colemans fuel in it........add 
    an equal amount of distilled water to this.... then, shake the contents up..always 
    remember to cover the hole in the top with your finger when shaking.......turn 
    the bottle over, holding the hole closed, and let settle, then with your other 
    hand, grab a 3-way pool test strip and place over a shot glass, then let a 
    small amount of water run over the ph part of the strip....the color should 
    be a violet blue........lots of honey in there folks......so, turn the jug 
    upright again, and remove cap......next, we have to "push" the honey into 
    the water.... to do this, get some muriatic acid, and a small bottle with 
    a dropper type top on it. fill this with muriatic, and add a small squirt 
    into the bottle.......if you look at the water when you do this, you'll see 
    the acid fall to the bottom, and quickly surface. But, with the acid, you'll 
    see ribbons of honey stay in the water........cover the hole with your finger 
    again, and shake..... turn the bottle over, holding the hole with your finger, 
    and test again.....keep repeating this, until the ph strip turns a reddish-pink 
    color......this is the ph level you need to keep it at.....if the strip goes 
    yellow, that means there's too much acid and there's nothing you can do about 
    it... at least not if you haven't saved anything in your shot glass......just 
    take the water from the shot glass, and add it to the jug, then retest.......if 
    the strip is okay, then replace a clean visionware bowl on the stove, and 
    drain the water into it.....bee careful not to let the colemans fuel fall 
    into it, or your honey will be good, but tainted......if some does get through, 
    take lighter, and light the top of the water, and the colemans will burn away........ 
    now, turn it up to a boil, and wait till you see it "cracking back". you should 
    have the fan on it, to help it go faster. When it starts to "crack back" alot, 
    remove from heat, and place the bowl in ice water.... WARNING.....make sure 
    its a Corning VisionsWare bowl....it's the only glass bowl that I know of 
    that can go from extreme heat and cold......other glass bowls would shatter 
    upon even touching the ice cold water..... after putting the bowl in ice water, 
    make sure you get a blow dryer, and blow air into the bowl to help it dry......if 
    it's still too liquidy after 5 minutes, then replace on the heat for a few 
    more minutes and repeat.. if you're too afraid of hurting the honey, then 
    just use the blow dryer to dry the rest of the way..........well folks, all 
    I can do to help you, is answer questions, take some pictures, and MAKE THE 
    VIDEO..... wonder if I should charge?....doubt it..... knowledge is free.......</font></p>

    Find a container that is made of an acetone safe material (glass, some plastics), 
    this will be your &quot;used acetone collector&quot;. Now find a funnel as 
    big as the opening of this container. Place the funnel so it rests in the 
    opening, and place a coffee filter or two in the top of the funnel. On this 
    filter, place your &quot;substance to be purified.&quot; The acetone for this 
    procedure should be pre-chilled, just put it in the freezer for awhile. Putting 
    it in the freezer for too long could cause condensation (thanks spitball). 
    Pour the cold acetone over the &quot;substance to be purified&quot; and watch 
    as it gets whiter and whiter! :0) (Note:<font color="#FF0000"> &quot;If you're 
    not using lab grade acetone, you're going to lose more of the product any 
    ways, so there's really no reason to cool it, although in small quantities
