Mobius: p-Fluoroamphetamine

For your information, some distant aquintance of mine , tasted some p-Fluoro-
Amphetamine not to long ago, motivated by a rumor that it would suposedly be 
much more potent than Amphetamine... And you know what, it is slightly less 
potent (about 20% I would say) and is fairly different in terms of global 
effects... (120 mg) Slow to come on... (T + 1h) Great feeling of warmth in the 
face and less in the rest of the body. (T + 1.5h) Disproportionatly great 
feeling of euphoria compared to the stimulation (both physical and mental) felt! 
Funny stuff! Doesn't compare to anything he did before and, belive me this guy 
has eaten a lot of exotic experimental materials and he knows what he's talking 
about!

NB: Above 200 mg the effect become too intense to clearly perceive the 
difference between this compound and regular Amphetamine.
