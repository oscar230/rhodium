1-Benzylpiperazine

1-Benzylpiperazine is a CNS stimulant.  In doses around 20-100 mg it
produces euphoria, wakefullness, improved vigilance.  The ratio of
centeral/peripheral effects is roughly  that of d-amphetamine.  The
duration of action is 6-8 hours.

Benzylpiperazine, like the amphetamines triggering the release of dopamine
and norepinephine as opposed to blocking their re-uptake as do cocaine,
amfonelic acid, and methylphenidate.

Studies using known amphetamine/methamphetamine addicts showed that 100mg
was not distinguishable from 7.5 mg of d-amphetamine.
They also noted that lower doses were not detected by the subjects.

Piberaline

Piberaline is 1-benzyl-4-picolonyl-piperazine; the picolonic acid amide of
BZP and is metabolised to BZP.  It has been researched as an antidepressant.

1-Piperonylpiperazine

Piperonylpiperazine also referred to as 1-(3,4-methylenedioxy)-benzyl-
piperazine (MDBPZ) shares the same substiutions on the benzene ring as
methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).  I do not know of any referrence to MDA
like activity.  There are animal studies indicating that it blocks the
putative neurotoxic effects of MDMA and possibly the enactogenic effects as
well.

If it has MDA like effects they might not occur in reasonable doses.
BZP is ~1/10 the potency of d-amphetamine. If piperonylpiperazine has a
similar drop in potency that would put the dose in the 1000mg range. Then
again speculation based on structural relationship to activity is
notoriously unreliable.

Fipexide

Fipexide is a nootropic sold under the brand name Vigilor.  Originally
marketed towards the geriatric patient it has become one of the growing
number of drugs used as cognitive enhancers.

Interestingly it is the p-chlorophenylacetamide of piperonylpierazine
(MDBZP) and is converted to MDBZP in vivo.  It is availiable from mail
order pharmacies specializing in smart drugs. Anyone with experience with
Fipexide is encouraged to share their knowledge.

Other BenzylPiperazine Derivatives

1-Benzyl-4-diphenylmethylpiperazine exibits cerebral vasodialating
properties, many analogs have been synthesised.  The 3,4,5 trimethoxy being
the most potent if I recall.  There are phosphonate derivatives that are Ca
channel blockers.

CAS No's:

[2759-28-6]  1-benzylpiperazine
[72878-35-4] 1-benzylpiperazine HCl

================================================================================

As a matter of fact I HAVE had  experience with this chemical/drug.
I made it myself from benzyl chloride and a mixture of piperazine-6H2O/
piperazine-HCl-2H2O (That I made from livestock wormer!!!). I have and
Organic Syntheses reference around here somewhere.

Frankly, I didn't like it very much. It _was_ a stimulant, but it caused
some jaw clenching and nervous tics (I couldn't stop playing with my
goatee. I mean I REALLY couldn't stop!).

It has what I would call a "serotonin component". I do't think explaining
that term in depth would be in the scope of this group. It's just not
exactly like amphetamines qualittatively. I also can not confirm whether
or not I had formed any dibenzylpiperazine, but the ref for the synth
said that the purity would be high. (That's why the salt system mentioned
is used.) That compound has a pharmacology all it's own. It would be
something of an antihistamine /maybe/.

Something tells me that ring substitution might produce interesting
compounds maybe like MDMA. Putting some sort of small aliphatic
group on the benzyl carbon might be interesting too.

A final note. I'm also not sure of my dosage. I /think/ Iit was a range
of 75-250 mg. 75 producing little effect and 250 feeling yucky.

Here is a quote from a letter from a resercher who is using TFMPP and
BZP HCl in his studies:

"Benzylpiperazine Hydrochloride (BZP HCl) simulates methamphetamine use
in lab animals.  It is a strong anorexic.  Anorexic capacity is
frequently equated with euphoriant capacity...  My observations show
this correlation to be true.

3-Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine Monohydrochloride (TFMPP), mimics MDMA
in lab animals.  A combination of BZP HCl and TFMPP has been observed to
cause activity that is prefered to MDMA in chemical discrimination tests
with lab animals.

A ratio of 2 parts BZP HCl to 1 part TFMPP was used for these chemical
descrimination tests.  Larger laboratory primates were given 200 mg. of
BZP HCl mixed with 100 mg. of TFMPP.  Observed activity appeared to last
from 6 to 10 hours.  There was an increased sociability observed in all
animals given this preparation.

Loss of apetite was observed both in the BZP HCl only group and the BZP
HCL and TFMPP (2:1) group."

================================================================================

I have read that benzyl piperazine is an active stimulant
similiar in properties to amphetamines in a dosage of 20-100 mg.
I have read this in PIHKAL by our good friend Dr. Shulgin.  I
seem to recall his reaction to make "E" entry number 72.  Is it
not possible that reacting p-methoxyphenol with fromyl
piperazine as a 40% solution with a 40% solution of formaldehyde
heated on steam bath would yield a substituted benzlpiperazine
just requiring the conversion of the hydroxy group to a methyl
ether and the addition of a bromine in the benzenes fourth
position as well as removal of the formyl group.  Sounds good so
far but how to make the methyl ether from the hydroxyl- I tend
to think that a alkali hydroxide and alkyl halide may work but
by products would be high in terms of the quarternary ammonium
halides formation.  If there was maybe a way to convert the
quarternary ammonium halide back to a three degree amine.
Another possible route maybe is to use methyl sulfate and
hydroxide or carbonate.  Or possibly the diazomethane reaction
but how would a formyl or if removed a two degree amine
react-would it?  A layer of ether could hold the substituted
benzylpiperazine and the aqeous layer hold the precursors to the
diazomethane.  One last question how would one concentrate the
reactants so that poly piperazinomethylation does not occur in
the other opn ortho position of the phenol?  I think much might
be discovered by delving into various analogs of
benzylpiperazines.  I would greatly appreciate input from my
fellow experimental innovators of hypothetical chemistry.

Thanks in advance

MDA piperazine derivative

Did anybody catch the comment in Shulgins book about the amphetamine
like properties Benzyl Piperazine posseses?  I even think he said
something about the possibility of 3,4 methylenedioxy benzylpiperazine
having MDA like qualities.  Well heres a brief skeleton of a synthesis I
worked out for this intriguing molecule.

First off if you can get ahold of piperonal then great, but most people
can't. So we'll start from a more basic building block- isosafrole.
This is oxidized with Na2Cr2O7/H2SO4 as gunther directs in his essential
oils volumes to yield 80% piperonal as the bisulphite complex.  The
solid bisulphite complex is boiled with sodium carbonate to give a good
yield of pure piperonal(3,4 methylenedioxy benzaldehyde).  This aldehyde
is reacted with formaldehyde and KOH to give a 70% yield of the benzyl
alcohol as illustrated in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. 2 .  The alcohol is then
chlorinated with thionyl chloride to yield 3,4 methylenedioxy
benzylchloride.  This is reacted with 2 moles of piperazine (DOES ANYONE
KNOW HOW WATCHED THIS CHEM. IS?) as directed in org syn vol 5 to give a
high yield of 3,4 methylenedioxy benzylpiperazine.

Any comments on this one?

        Has anyone tried this conversion of 1-Benzylpiperazine to 1-
Benzylpiperazine HCL ? Does it work. What is the dosage? Also i've been
told that it should be ingested, not snorted or injected. Is this true?
This is a synth ive seen.

1.) To 35.25 grams of  benzyl piperazine add 99% Isopropyl alcohol to
    make 200ml. of solution.
2.) Make a separate solution containing 250 ml of chilled acetone and
    35 ml of concentrated Hydrochloric acid added slowly.  After making
    this 285 ml of solution, add another 115ml of acetone to make 400ml
    of this solution.
3.) Slowly add 200ml of the acetone/HCl solution to the
    benzylpiperazine solution.
4.) Evaporate.

        Any comments?

This is easy, and can be done by anybody.

Place 20 grams of liquid benzylpiperazine in a 500 ml glass beaker
(no plastic!) and add 100 ml 99% anhydrous isopropylalcohol or methanol,
and give it a good stir. Next add 15 ml of hardware store hydrochloric
acid (muriatic acid) of 30-31% strength, and stir the solution again until
it is thorougly mixed. Now, while stirring, add 250 ml of acetone in 50 ml
portions. Now white benzylpiperazine hydrochloride crystals will form in
the solution. Let the mixture stand in the refrigerator for an hour, break
up any lumps of crystals that may have formed, and filter them off with
a coffee filter and let the crystals completely dry in the air.

This was taken from its MSDS, I don't have van nostrand's Hazardous Properties
of Industrial Materials here that should have more info. Sounds nice and
apetising doesn't it....This is the same stuff that Shulgin talks about in
Pihkal. I'm no pharmacologist, if you want the pharmacology... people you've
got the cas number, one of you students with free stn access can go and do a
search with STN. I guess its somewhat like phenylpiperazine with 5HT1a affinity.
Benzylpiperazine is also probably a powerful antihemintic like its parent,
piperazine, so you might not get off but...

================================================================================

Here is the information regarding 1-benzylpiperazine also known as
N-benzylpiperazine.  The benzylpiperazine currently availiable from CRSB is the
chemical discussed in PHIKAL.   It is sold as  the free base which is caustic
and unstable.  It forms a really pretty dicarbonate on standing in open air.
The dihydrochloride is fine with to off white crystals.

Here is the quote from PIHKAL:

There is a benzyl amine that is a pure stimulant, which has been closely
compared to amphetamine in its action This is benzylpiperazine, a base that is
active in the 20 to 100 milligram range, but which has an acceptability similar
to amphetamine. If this is a valid stimulant, I think that much magic might be
found in and around compounds such as (1) the MDMA analogue, N-(3,4-methylene-
dioxybenzyl)piperazine (or its counterpart N-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)-N'-
methylpiperazine) or (2) the DOM analogue, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzylpiperazine.

MukiBear, Personal BzP notes:

Got my first taste of BzP 'bout two weeks ago - the freebase form.
Started out with 100 mgs, now up to about 200 mgs per dose.

First some questions. One supplier offers BzP freebase liquid, 97%.Well, 3%
what? One would assume H2O or EtOH, just to keep the stuff liquid, but it'd be
nice to know. Also, has anyone tried snorting the carbonate salt (what forms
when you just let it dry out)? Personally, I hate snorting anything and wouldn't
try it, but others have different tastes. Lastly, after a week of daily use, I
developed a mild bladder infection, which cleared up immediately with
antibiotics. Another test subject also noticed some similar irritation. Not to
get too physical, but frequent urination seems to be an effect of the drug, and
I was wondering if anyone else had noticed anything similar...

Okay, time for ratings and reviews.

Mvua (ie, MukiBear) gives straight BzP 4 outta 5 for recreational purposes,
better than Bontril/phendimetrazine/doctor-speed, *way* better than street-
crank, not quite as good as real ice. Other subjects agree. On the Shulgin
psychospiritual scale, though, it's a flat zero, no value at all.

[MukiBear now disagrees - BzP is the best meditation aide this Bear has ever
encountered - sure beats the hell out of green tea]

100 mgs BzP + 1.5 mls 1,4 BDO:
5 outta 5. The G just takes the edge off the speed, and it *rocks* to be on G
and not be at all sleepy. Still zero on Shulgin scale.

150 mgs BzP + several oz EtOH:
I normally hate alcohol, but speed makes me crave drink. Again, 5 outta 5 -
drunk without being sloppy, *very* fun to socialize, etc. Shulgin zero.

50 mgs BzP + 500 mgs DXM +1 mg Xanax:
3 outta 5, recreational, +1 on Shulgin. Mostly just weird and kinda scary.
It's very ODD to have focus on DXM, and not altogether pleasant. Had hoped
for something like DXM + MDA, but no dice.

150 mgs BzP + 500 mgs DXM + 1 mg Xanax + MJ:
Fuckin' rocks! 5/5 recreational, ++ Shulgin. Very interesting and well worth
repeating - must try taking BzP after hitting 2nd or 3rd plateau. Strangely
powerful - I couldn't drive at all (2nd plateau is usually no problem).

150 mgs BzP + 10 mg hydrocodone:
Yeah, I know it's not safe, Belushi-bullshit, but it's fun as hell. Lortab is
a stimulant for confirmed junkies, and this combo made me jump around like a
jackrabbit on cocaine. In deference to my ancestors: yeeeee-haw! 5/5, 0 Shulgin.

N-BENZYLPIPERAZINE (BZP)

A Benzyl Amine, A CNS Stimulant.

I've received a fair amount of correspondance regarding BZP recently.
The central issues seem to be:

   * "Is Shulgin refering to N-Benzylpiperazine?"
   * "Is it an amphetamine like CNS stimulant?"

Both are true.  BPZ is about one tenth the potency of dextroamphetamine
but in comparable doses subjectively the same.

In the PHIKAL, within the commentary on phenethylamine, Shulgin took the
oppotunity to discuss two related classes compounds.

     Benzyl amines- compounds where the benzene ring is connected to the
     amine nitrogen by one carbon

     Phenyl amines- compounds where the benzene ring is connected to the
     amine nitrogen directly.

One benzyl amine he states is an amphetamine like CNS stimulant.  His
exact words were

     "There is a benzyl amine that is a pure stimulant, which has been
     closely compared to amphetamine in its action This is
     benzylpiperazine,
     a base that is active in the 20 to 100 milligram range, but which
     has an
     acceptability similar to amphetamine.

Dirk deGroeten pointed out, quite correctly that there is more than one
posible benzylpiperazine stating:

     "How can you be sure that Shulgin isn't talking about
     2-benzylpiperazine, which in structure is much closer to
     amphetamine ?"

I responded that I concluded that Shulgin was indeed refering to the
N-benzylpiperazine.  If he were refering to the 2-benzylpiperzine it
would not be a benzylamine.  Further when addressing the MDMA analog he
did specify (N-(3,4-methylenedioxy)piperazine).  None the less, I had
very little information on benzylpiperazine (BZP) and it sounded
interesting.

The following abstracts concure.  I would be fascinated to know if the
3.4 methylenedioxy analog or the 4Me 2,5DiMeO BPZ  had CNS activity
related to their phenethylamine/phenisopropylamine counterparts.

Here are a few abstracts I ran across:

Title:  A comparison of the effects of 1-benzylpiperazine and
	  dexamphetamine on performance tests. Comparison of the effects
        of dexamphetamine and 1-benzylpiperazine in former addicts.
Author: Bye C.; Munro Faure A.D.; Peck A.W.; Young P.A.
Publ:   EUR.J.CLIN.PHARMACOL., (1973) 6/3 (163-169).

The subjective, behavioural and autonomic effects of dexamphetamine
10 mg, 1 benzylpiperazine 100 mg and lactose dummy were compared in a
group of 18 former amphetamine addicts. All subjects received the three
preparations according to a balanced design under double blind
conditions. 1-Benzylpiperazine and dexamphetamine produced
indistinguishable subjective effects and both were liked. The effects
of both compounds differed significantly from the effects following the
dummy preparation. Increases in pulse rate and both systolic and
diastolic blood pressure were similar following the two active
compounds, but 1 benzylpiperazine produced pupillary dilation whereas
no significant change in pupil size followed dummy or dexamphetamine.
It was concluded that 1 benzylpiperazine is a compound liable to abuse
by an addict population, and that this type of study might be of value
in predicting abuse liability of other new drugs.

trimetazidine when tested for cerebral vasodilating activity, by
measuring the ratio of the maximum change of blood flow in vertebral
arteries after i.v. administration of the test compound (1 mg/kg) to
that of papaverine (1 mg/kg) in mongrel dogs (11-18 kg). (6 e-j) Were
more active than cinnarizine and papaverine, and (6e) was shown to
exhibit a selective effect on vertebral arteries.

1-benzylpiperazine HCl), only the non-substituted phenyl (7a, i.p.)
showed good antidepressant activity vs. tetrabenazine-induced palpebral
ptosis in mice. The 3,4-methylenedioxy- disubstituted cmpd 7i had
similar anticonvulsant activity vs. maximal electroshock seizures (MES)
to cmpd 7h. Among cmpds substituted at the 5 position of the benzofuran
ring, only the methoxy cmpd 7n was more active than 7h and had best
overall pharmacological activity. The 6-methoxy derivative 7o showed
similar anticonvulsant activity to 7n but was slightly more toxic.
Befuraline, imipramine and carbamazepine were reference drugs.

Stimulus properties of antidepressants in the rat.

Source: Psychopharmacology (Berl), 1980 Feb, 67:2, 111-8

Abstract
	Various doses of bupropion HCl (Wellbatrin) (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), a new
	phenylaminoketone antidepressant, were employed as cues in a two-lever
	operant discrimination from saline control injections in rats on an FR10
	schedule of food reinforcement. Subjects reached and maintained a high
	level of discrimination in the O vs 20 mg/kg bupropion stimulus condition
	but not at the lower doses. In generalization testing, the following
	compounds produced dose-related responding on the bupropion lever:
	viloxazine, nomifensine, caffeine, d-amphetamine, cocaine, methylphenidate,
	and benzylpiperazine. Drugs that failed to show dose-related generalization
	included phenethylamine, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, imipramine,
	nortriptyline, amitriptyline, desipramine, mianserin, chlordiazepoxide,
	diazepam, scopolamine, phenobarbital, and morphine. With the important
	exception of viloxazine, the generalization profile of bupropion seems to
	reflect its previously reported locomotor stimulant effects in the rat
	rather than its antidepressant activity and suggests that species
	differences exist between man and rat with regard to the pharmacologic
	activity of this new antidepressant.

Studies on the biochemical mode of action of EGYT-475, a new antidepressant.

Source: Pol J Pharmacol Pharm, 1987 Mar-Apr, 39:2, 203-11

Abstract
	We studied the mode of action of N-benzyl-piperazine-picolinylfumarate
	(EGYT-475) and of its metabolite N-benzyl-piperazine (EGYT-2760) in CFY
	rats. It was found that EGYT-475 had no uptake-inhibitory effect but
	EGYT-2760 inhibited the high-affinity uptake of 3H-noradrenaline,
	3H-dopamine and especially that of 3H-serotonin both in vitro and ex
	vivo. Neither of the two compounds changed the serotonin turnover. Only
	EGYT-2760 evoked hyperthermia in rats at a high ambient temperature
	(28 degrees C). This effect was abolished by cyproheptadine but not by
	amitriptyline. EGYT-2760 antagonized serotonin-induced contractions of
	the stomach fundus but it was inactive in inhibiting the serotonin-
	induced platelet aggregation. Our results suggest that EGYT-2760, an
	active metabolite of EGYT-475, has a central serotoninomimetic action
	which involves 5-HT uptake-inhibition and 5-HT1 receptor agonistic effect.

Pharmacokinetic aspects of the mode of action of EGYT-475, a new antidepressant.

Source: Pol J Pharmacol Pharm, 1987 Mar-Apr, 39:2, 107-12

Abstract
	EGYT-475 (N-benzyl-piperazine-picolinyl fumarate; Trelibet) metabolism was
	compared in rats, dogs and man. In the rat 7 urinary metabolites of EGYT-475
      were found, and 4 were identified as: N-picolinyl-piperazine (EGYT-1354)
	(30%), picolinic acid (28.5%), hippuric acid (53%) and N-benzylpiperazine
	(EGYPT-2760) (3.7%). The results show that debenzylation is the main route
	of EGYT-475 metabolism in the rat. By this route EGYT-2760, the active
	EGYT-475 metabolite, is further metabolized. In the dog the main metabolic
	pathway is hydrolysis, and because of that the formed EGYT-2760 is not
	metabolized further and its urinary content exceeds 50%. In man, similarly
	as in the rat, debenzylation is the preferred route of EGYT-475 metabolism.
	These results explain much higher toxicity of EGYT-475 in dogs than in rats
	and man.

Abstract
     	The effects of Trelibet (EGYT-475, N-benzyl-piperazine-picolinyl-fumarate)
	and its active metabolite (EGYT-2760, N-benzyl-piperazine) on the

	compared with those of MCPP (m-chlorophenyl-piperazine) which is the
	common metabolite of the arylpiperazine antidepressants Trazodone and
	Etoperidone. The contraction inhibitory potencies of the agents were
	determined on the equipotent contractions (EC50) to serotonin (5-HT) and
	prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). Isotonic contractile responses to
	5-HT were not affected by EGYT-475, however, both EGYT-2760 and MCPP
	produced concentration related and reversible inhibition of the
	serotoninergic responses. The IC50 values for EGYT-2760 and MCPP were
	40.5 +/- 7.5 mumol/l and 125 +/- 35 nmol/l, respectively. The inhibition
	was selective for the serotoninergic responses, as the equipotent
	responses to PGF2 alpha were not affected. EGYT-2760 and MCPP displayed
	not only 5-HT antagonistic, but also partial agonistic activities on the
	rat fundus preparation. Maximum contractile response of the fundus
	preparation to MCPP was approximately 25%, to EGYT-2760 was 10% of the

Title:  Circling behavior induced by dopamine releasers and/or uptake
        inhibitors during degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway

Author:  Oberlander, Claude; Euvrard, Catherine; Dumont, Claude;
         Boissier, Jacques R.
Pub:     Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1979), 60(2-3), 163-70

Abstract:

A no. of compds. which induce ipsilateral circling behavior in rats with
chronic unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) destruction of the
nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) [51-61-6] pathway through their postulated
DA-releasing and/or uptake-inhibiting properties, were tested 24 h after a
6-OHDA lesion. Under these conditions, in contrast to chronically lesioned
animals, d [51-63-8] or l-amphetamine sulfate [51-62-7],
d-methamphetamine-HCl [51-57-0], and benzylpiperazine-HCl [72878-35-4]
induced contralateral turns whereas methylphenidate-HCl
[298-59-9],pipradrol-HCl [71-78-3], dl-p-chloroamphetamine-HCl [3706-38-5],
mazindol [22232-71-9], HR370 [73068-25-4], nomifensine maleate
[32795-47-4], benztropine mesylate [132-17-2] still induced ipsilateral
turns. The monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline-HCl [306-07-0] was
inactive and the DA receptor agonist apomorphine-HCl [314-19-2] induced a
mild contralateral circling response at high doses only. The contralateral
circling response to d-amphetamine was hardly antagonized by a high dose of
dl-.alpha.-Me p-tyrosine Me ester(AMT), and was increased by reserpine.
Striatal DA levels were increased in the lesioned side and restored to
normal values after d-amphetamine, in contrast to methylphenidate.
Ipsilateral turns recorded with chronically lesioned rats were strongly
decreased by AMT except in the case of p-chloroamphetamine, methylphenidate
and pipradrol. The response of reserpinized rats was decreased except with
d-amphetamine and its N-Me deriv. Thus, drugs inducing contralateral turns
during degeneration of the nigrostriatal DA pathway predominantly release
newly-synthesized DA independently of nerve impulse flow, whereas
ipsilateral turns are either triggered by inhibiting of DA uptake or by the
release of the reserpine-sensitive pool of DA, both on the intact side.
This last effect may require a normal nerve impulse flow. This method thus
provides the first direct behavioral evidence of differences in the mode of
action of drugs interfering presynaptically with DA.

Neuropharmacology of BZP

1-Benzylpiperazine (BZP) has a peripheral sympathomimetic action and a complex central action, both
directly and indirectly acting upon on all monoamine[1, 2, 3]. There are few experiments investigating
the nature of BZPs mechanism of action, and they are mainly in vitro, and on peripheral nerves. This
article attempts to unify the existing research, to extrapolate the results to an in vitro, central
situation and, in light of recent advances in pharmacology, clarify certain findings.

The action of BZP on the noradrenergic system has two main facets. The first is the action on the a-2
adrenoreceptor, and the second is on the noradrenergic uptake carrier. The a2-adrenoreceptor is the
receptor that mediates presynaptic negative feedback, both centrally and peripherally in the adrenergic
system. BZP has been shown to be an antagonist at the a2-adrenoreceptor[1], thus negating negative
feedback at the synapse, and causing a larger stimulation evoked release of neurotransmitter. This is the
same process as yohimbine, though, BZP is some 10,000 times less potent, but possibly just as
efficacious[1]. These results were found from experimenting on peripheral nerves, not central ones, and
it is possible that BZP has no a2-antagonist properties in the CNS. I find it likely that BZPs central a2
action is extremely limited, especially at recreational doses, but even if there is a significant a2-
receptor blockade, it does not effect the subjective experience, and is more likely to effect things like
blood pressure. BZP has also been shown to inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline (NA)[1, 3]. The reuptake
inhibition is amphetamine-like (a theme you will come to recognize), and hence also causes the
stimulation independent release of NA[1]. Although the experiments which showed the stimulation
independent release of NA was done on peripheral nervous tissues, a study has been done to show that
this action is probably exhibited in central nerves as well[3]. This amphetamine-like reuptake inhibition is
probably BZPs noradrenergic action of most consequence in the CNS. In the peripheral nervous system,
the a2-adrenoreceptor blockade is almost certainly responsible for most of the symptoms, as addition of
clonidine (an a2 receptor agonist) blocks almost all of the effect of BZP in peripheral tissue[1].

The action of BZP on dopaminergic system is probably just restricted to the amphetamine-like reuptake
inhibition and stimulation independent release of dopamine (DA). BZP has been shown increase the
concentration of DA in a cell free homogenate of subcortical rat brain, and decrease the amount of DA
found in cells after 14 days of treatment[3].

The action of BZP on the serotonergic system is the most studied aspect of BZPs action, as one member
of the team of experimenters that did most of the research into BZP, was an employee of a drug company
eager to prove the serotoninomimetic action of BZP (as this indicates more action as an antidepressant,
and less possibility of abuse). Results show that BZP increases the amount of serotonin (5-HT) in the
extracellular fluid surrounding subcortical neurons and decreases the amount of 5-HT in cells after 14
days of treatment, indicating that BZP exhibits the now familiar amphetamine-like inhibition of reuptake
and stimulation independent release of 5-HT[3]. On top of this central and probably peripheral
amphetamine-like action, BZP seems to be an agonist of the 5-HT2B receptor. The logic behind the
conclusion that BZP acts as a direct agonist at the 5-HT2B receptor is as follows: When BZP is applied
to isolated rat stomach, it causes the smooth muscle to contract, and this contraction is blocked by
methergoline, indicating the process is receptor mediated[2]. This could indicate that BZP is a direct
5-HT receptor agonist, but it could also be explained by the fact that BZP causes 5-HT to be released
from nerves. BZP also causes hyperthermia in rats at high ambient temperature an effect blocked by the
5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine, but not by amitriptyline[3]. Amitriptyline binds to the 5-HT reuptake
carrier, probably blocking BZPs amphetamine-like action. Seeing that BZP can still exhibit a serotonergic
action, while the stimulation-independent release of 5-HT is blocked, shows that it must be directly
activating a 5-HT receptor, and seeing that it causes stomach contraction, which is mediated by the
5-HT2B receptor, it must be a direct agonist at the 5-HT2B receptor. The potency of BZP at the 5-HT2B
receptor must be at least 100,000 times less that 5-HT[2], meaning that functionally, it is closer to an
antagonist than an agonist.

When one compares the contribution of these different neurotransmitter to the pharmacological action
of BZP it is likely that 5-HT is the major player, as BZP has the highest affinity for the 5-HT reuptake
carrier (IC50 2.9 x 10-6 mol/L). It is likely that NA and DA play a roughly equal role centrally (reuptake
carrier IC50 2.8 x 10-5 mol/L and 1.3 x 10-5 mol/L respectively)[3]. Peripherally, NA is the largely
responsible for BZPs peripheral effects, as NA is the main mediator of the sympathetic nervous system.

The ability for BZP to induce dependance initially looks marked, as it has a pronounced central
dopaminergic action[3], but if one considers all the factors, this may not be so. Tolerance to BZPs
central action will develop quickly, as it probably accumulates in synaptic vesicles in the same fashion
as amphetamine, while tolerance to BZPs peripheral blockade of a2-adrenoreceptors will be limited or
nonexistent. This will moderate the abuse potential, as if dependence does develop it will occur along
with central tolerance, and if an individual tries to up the dose of BZP to overcome the tolerance, the
peripheral effects (mediated by the a2 receptor) would be intolerable.

In summary, BZPs action could be described as somewhere between amphetamine and
MDMA including a yohimbine like action as well, with limited to moderate abuse potential.
