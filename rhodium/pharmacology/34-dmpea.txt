Very interesting report! Phenethylamines tend to be metabolized by MAOB
(and tryptamines by MAOA, though each can work on the other). Deprenyl
is an MAOB inhibitor in smaller doses (up to 10 mg/day), but also inhibits
MAOA in larger doses. I would guess your 25 mg inhibited both MAOA/B
as much as possible, so I don't think a higher dose would make a difference.
