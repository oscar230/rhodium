<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The main stumbling block for clandestine synthesis of PCP
  in the US is the aquisition of piperidine. Piperidine is a closely
  watched chemical and is generally obtained by diversion from
  wholesale manufacturers. It has little legitimate use outside
  of pharmaceutical manufacturing. A clean bottle (i.e one that
  is not watched or traceable) can sell for as much as $1000 a
  kg on the black market. It can be synthesized by the reduction
  of pyridine, but it should be noted that pyridine itself is somewhat
  watched because of its use in methamphetamine synthesis. It also
  may be obtained by the hydrolyis of piperine, a major constituent
  of black pepper oil, by hydrolysis with aqueous KOH or by cyclization
  of 1,5-diaminopentane. Of course, the necessity of piperidine
  can be eliminated by synthesis of a PCP analog that does not
  contain the piperidine ring, such as PCPy. The piperidine ring
  can also be built by alkylation of PCA with 1,5-dibromopentane,
  as discussed in <A HREF="pca_synth.html#SchemeIV">Scheme V</A>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Although cyclohexanone is not watched as closely as piperidine,
  it is well known to be a vital ingredient for PCP manufacture.
  It is commonly available in bulk in the resins industry, where
  it is used as a solvent, and is also used in huge quantities
  in the manufacture of several polymers. It may also be synthesized
  on a laboratory scale by the oxidation of cyclohexanol.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>Procedure:</B> Cautiously add 20 ml of conc. sulfuric acid
    to 60 g of crushed ice and mix well. Add 20 g of cyclohexanol
    and place a thermometer in the mixture (temp. should be &lt;30
    C). Prepare a solution of 21 g sodium dichromate dihydrate in
    10 ml of water. Add about 1 ml of this solution to the reaction
    flask with vigorous swirling. Add the rest of the dichromate
    solution with continuous swirling at a rate that keeps the temperature
    between 25 and 35 C. After the addition is complete, continue
    stirring until the temperature falls by 1 or 2 degrees. Add about
    1 g of solid oxalic acid to destroy any excess dichromate. Rinse
    the reaction mixture into a 500 ml distillation flask with 100
    ml of water, add a boiling stone, and distill the product rapidly.
    The cyclohexanone will distill as a mixture with water (an azeotrope)
    at about 95 C. Continue distillation until 60-100 ml of distillate
    is obtained. Add about 15 g of sodium chloride to the distillate
    and swirl until most of it has disolved. Transfer the mixture
    to a seperatory funnel and discard the lower aqueous layer. Dry
    the upper layer with 1-2 g of potassium carbonate and decant.
    The cyclohexanone will now be of sufficient purity to use in
    PCP synthesis, but if further purification is desired, it can
    be redistilled.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
