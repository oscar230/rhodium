<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is a promising underutilized method which takes place
in one step (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 59-61,67</A>).
The starting material is N-benzoylpiperidine, which may be easily
prepared in ~90% yield from benzoyl chloride and piperidine (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 68</A>) or purchased
commercially. Reaction of N-benzoylpiperidine with the lithium
or magnesium organometallic derivative of 1,5-dibromopentane gives
PCP. The only difficulty in this route is the preparation of the
dibromopentane Grignard reagent, with its strict requirement for
anhydrous conditions. This route has an overall yield of ~75%
with a difficulty rating of 2 out of 10, and a hazard rating of
2 out of 10 (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 64</A>).</P>

<P>Other analogs could also be prepared with this method by substituting
another secondary amine (e.g. dimethylamine or diethylamine) for
piperidine in the reaction with benzoyl chloride.</P>

    <P><B>Procedure: </B>A Grignard reagent is prepared from 56 g
    of magnesium turnings and 230 g of 1,5-dibromopentane in 2 liters
    of ether, and the mixture stirred and refluxed for 3 hrs. 151
    g of N-benzoyl piperidine is added, and the ether is removed
    by distilling until the temperature in reaction vessel reaches
    about 83 C. The reaction mixture is then stirred at this temperature
    for sixteen hours, cooled and treated with sufficient ammonium
    hydroxide and a saturated solution of NH4Cl until the precipitate
    dissolves. The solution was diluted with 2 L of ether, and the
    ether layer removed by decantation. The ether layer is then washed,
    dried over sodium hydroxide, and the ether distilled off. The
    residue is distilled <I>in vacuo</I> to obtain PCP (bp 128-134
    C/0.8 mm). (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 67</A>)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
