<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Discovery of PCP:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>PCP was first synthesized at Parke Davis in 1956. Its synthesis
  was serendipitous, in that it was an entirely unexpected product
  from a reaction intended to produce another compound (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  1</A>). Because it had such a unique structure, PCP was submitted
  for evaluation by general pharmacodynamic screening. This involves
  the administration of a test compound to an animal and observing
  its behavior. Although this may seem to be a low tech approach
  to the discovery of new drugs, a trained pharmacologist can often
  identify potentially interesting physiological effects of an
  unexplored compound in this manner. During these tests, PCP was
  found to have a few rather unique properties. It acted mainly
  on the central nervous system, producing a variety of effects
  that differed depending on the species and dosage. The responses
  ranged from ataxia (loss of coordination) and excitation to a
  condition of surgical anesthesia. Most species in which PCP was
  evaluated displayed a tameing and quieting effect at low doses.
  Because of these desirable anesthetic effects and the lack of
  respiratory depression, a medicinal chemistry program was initiated
  to evaluate the effect of structural modification on activity.
  Part of this work was eventually published in a paper that presented
  the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of sixty analogs
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 2</A>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="Pharmacology"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clinical studies
on PCP:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Because of the promising nature of PCP as an anesthetic, toxicological,
  neuropharmacological,&nbsp;and metabolism trials were undertaken
  (reviewed in <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 3</A>).
  By 1957, only 3 years after the compound had been synthesized,
  human clinical trials were underway. By 1963, it had been administered
  to over 3,000 patients <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref.
  5</A>). The first trials ran smoothly, but limitations regarding
  its use as a surgical anesthetic in man soon became apparent.
  There was a prolonged postoperative psychosis (&quot;emergence
  phenomina&quot;) produced in 15-30% of the patients (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  4</A>).&nbsp;The emergence phenomina appeared as bizarre thought
  patterns, hallucinations, or delerium as the patient was recovering
  from anesthesia. Ironically these same therapeutically undesirable
  phenomina are the properties that make PCP and ketamine so much
  in demand as recreational or entheogenic drugs. A concensus of
  the early experiments was that the psychotomimetic effects result
  from PCP's ability to produce sensory deprivation. Despite its
  promising profile in low doses as an anesthetic agent (20 mg
  IV), the exited state often produced at the higher doses necessary
  for surgical anesthesia (4x this amount) lead to withdrawl of
  PCP from clinical use in 1965.</P>
  <P>Additional effects were frequently noted during clinical tests,
  such as feelings of estrangement, lonliness, negativism, and
  hostility. These effects are much less common during non-clinical
  (recreational) administration, and are partially due to the stressful
  environment of the clinical tests and the test subject's expectations
  of the drug's effects. Such negative experiences are not surprising,
  and can be expected in subjects administered powerful mind-altering
  drugs while having their behavior closely monitored by experimenters.
  In contrast, when the drug is self administered by an idividual
  that is aware of the effects and is seeking an entheogenic/recreational
  experience, the mental set is entirely different and negative
  experiences much more infrequent.</P>
  <P>PCP and its structural derivatives mimic the primary attention
  and cognition deficits of schizopherenia in normal individuals
  more closely than any other drug <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref.
  6, 7</A>). Administration of 0.1 mg/kg IV of PCP produces a predictable
  series of mental alterations that can be difficult to differentiate
  from true schizophrenia. These effects may include defective
  perceptual discrimination, concrete thinking, psychomotor retardation,
  distractibility, alteration of body image, loss of body boundaries,
  and a profound sense of unreality. LSD, on the other hand, more
  closely simulates the secondary symptoms of schizophrenia, such
  as hallucinations.</P>
  <P>In the late 1950's, experiments were conducted on administration
  of PCP to schizophrenic patients. The results were striking.
  PCP was found to greatly intensify the thought disorders already
  present, and this effect could last from four to six weeks. This
  brings up a point that has become ingrained in the street lore
  surrounding PCP: that it can cause permanent insanity. Actually,
  PCP has been known to precipitate severe psychoses in individuals
  not previously diagnosed as schizophrenic. This situation has
  also been seen with amphetamine and LSD administration, where
  it is equally rare but still well documented. In these cases,
  it is likely that the drug unmasks a previously present but latent
  mental abnormality. In any event, the effects are definately
  unpleasant for some people, and PCP should never be dispensed
  in a casual manner.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><CENTER><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+2">Ketamine in psychotherapy:</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></P>
  <P>Recently Ketamine has been used in psychotherapy for the treatment
  of fear of dying (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  34</A>). Ketamine has the ability, shared with PCP, to produce
  model Near Death Experiences (NDE's) (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  33</A>). NDE's are of considerable interest in the study of medicine,
  neuroscience, psychiatry, philosophy, and religon, although they
  have not been adequately researched. They classically involve
  an experience of dying that is percieved as &quot;real&quot;,
  with sensations of timelessness, clarity of thought and feelings,
  calmness and peacefulness, and the sense that the experience
  cannot be adequately described with language. NDE's can be experienced
  during surgical crises in which a patient has apparently died,
  with loss of vital signs. Such a NDE often results loss of the
  fear of death and a renewed interest in life. Production of artificial
  NDE's by ketamine has similarly been found effective to decrease
  an unatural fear of death. An outstanding article is available
  online concerning the <A HREF="http://lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ketamine/Ketamine_near-death.html">use
  of ketamine to produce NDE's,</A> and their therapeutic potential.
  <A HREF="http://lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ketamine/Ketamine_NDE_Model.html">Another
  excellent online article</A> discusses the central role of the
  NMDA receptor in mediation of ketamine induced NDE's .</P>
  <P>Ketamine has also been used in psychotherapy for alcoholism
  with a fair amount of success (<A HREF="http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v06n3/06319ket.html">Ketamine
  Psychedelic Therapy</A> (KPT)). In one study, total abstinence
  for more than one year was observed in 65.8% of patients recieving
  ketamine, compared to 24% of the conventional treatment control
  group. Additional positive results were apparent, as assayed
  by Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles.
  The results included positive transformation of nonverbalized
  (mostly unconscious) self-concept and emotional attitudes. There
  were also significant positive changes in life values and purposes,
  important insights into the meaning of life and an increase in
  the level of spiritual development (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  35</A>). Similar studuies have been undertaken on the use of
  ketamine in the treatment of heroin addiction (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  36</A>).</P>
  <P>One very interesting focus of another study on KPT in alcoholism
  was the interactions of ketamine and nimodipine (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  37</A>). Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used
  to treat migraine headaches and complications arising from stroke.
  The underlying mechanism of ketamine is the blockade of another
  class of calcium channels. These calcium channels are known to
  be involved in the processes of thought, memory, emotions, seizures,
  and the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol
  dependence. Nimodipine has been previously shown to reverse memory
  disturbances induced by ketamine, and in this study nimodipine
  significantly improved the patient's memory of the content of
  the ketamine psychotherapy session.</P>

and/or entheogenic) use of PCP:</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>PCP first appeared as an illicit drug in San Fransisco in
  1967, and has remained available on the black market ever since.
  However, it is <A HREF="http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofax/pcp.html">becoming
  a less commonly used drug</A>, with only 3.9% of highschool seniors
  in 1997 having ever experienced it, compared to 12.8% in 1979.
  It has been sold under its true name and a variety of street
  names, as has been commonly misrepresented as any number of other
  drugs. Currently, the majority of the clandestine PCP synthesis
  occurs in the Los Angeles area, with distribution being controlled
  by street gangs such as the Crips. Its use today is mostly restricted
  to lower socioeconomic classes in large urban areas, such as
  L.A. and Washington, D.C.<BR>
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Dangers associated with PCP use:</FONT></STRONG></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>PCP has a remarkably negative popular image. This is partly
  due to the bizarre and violent actions that users may display,
  although PCP is probably just as likely to precipitate violence
  as society's favorite dissociative drug, alcohol. However, there
  is the definate potential to produce a mental state in which
  rational thought is entirely absent, resulting in strange and
  uncharacteristic behavior.</P>
  <P>Although there is the possibility of vioent and bizarre behavior
  associated with PCP use, this potential has been greatly exagerated.
  Even in professional medical and law enforcement texts this is
  often apparent, as in this passage taken from a textbook on clinical
  toxicology (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 66</A>):</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>&quot;Perhaps the hallmark of PCP intoxication is the recurring
    delusion of superhuman strength and invulnerability resulting
    from the analgesic and dissociative properties of the drug. Intoxicated
    patients have been known to snap hancuffs and, unarmed, attack,
    large groups of people or police officers. This loss of fear
    has led patients to try to stop a train by standing in front
    of it, to grossly mutilate thems elves and others, to climb into
    a polar bear's cave to take a picture, and to jump from windows
    or cliffs. The bizarre behavior is often violent, sometimes with
    gruesome mutilation of both the patient and his or her victim.
    One intoxicated abuser pulled out his front teeth with a pair
    of pliers. Another woman fried her baby in cooking oil.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Most casual users of the drug do not experience such effects,
  but this potential should be realized. Because bodily sensation
  is dissociated and pain perception can be lost, users may lose
  track of their bodies and seriously injurie themselves. Therefore,
  it is wise to only consume PCP in the presence of another individual
  that is not intoxicated and can act as a &quot;babysitter&quot;,
  preventing the user from inadvertently harming himself. Even
  with this precaution, it may be difficult to prvent a user from
  trying to walk into traffic, drive, or engage in other potentially
  harmful activity.</P>
  <P>One way that users reduce this possibility is by mentally
  &quot;programming&quot; themselves prior to ingestion not to
  move from the safe location chosen for the experience, even if
  it may seem like a good idea. Also, the use of tiny doses, by
  vaporization and inhalation until the desired effects are apparent,
  allows the production of a more managable, shorter lasting intoxication
  than other ingestion methods.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Physical effects:</FONT> </B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>At low to moderate doses, the physiological effects of PCP
  may include a slight increase in breathing rate and a more pronounced
  rise in blood pressure and pulse rate. Respiration becomes shallow,
  and flushing and profuse sweating may occur. Generalized numbness
  of the extremities and muscular incoordination are common. The
  pupils are neither constricted nor dilated. Nystagmus (involuntary
  movement of the eyes) is a characteristic effect, and may be
  vertical, rotary, or horizontal. Motor symptoms are common and
  may include ataxia (impaired coordination of movement), athetosis
  (slow writhing movements), myoclonic jerks, and bizarre posture.</P>
  <P>At higher doses, there is a drop in blood pressure, pulse
  rate, and respiration. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,
  blurred vision, extreme nystagmus, drooling, loss of balance,
  and dizziness. High doses of PCP can cause seizures, coma, and
  death (though death more often results from accidental injury
  or suicide during PCP intoxication).</P>
  <P>Treatment of PCP overdose is largely symptomatic and centers
  around increasing elimination. PCP is eliminated in the GI tract
  and then quickly reabsorbed, resulting in very long lasting effects.
  Oral administration of activated charcoal can therefore be helpful
  to bind it after elimination and remove it from circulation.
  Increasing the urine acidity by administration of ammonium chloride
  (or by drinking cranberry juice) also speeds elimination. If
  vital signs are stable and the primary symptom is confusion or
  agitation, it is best to reduce all sensory stimulation (such
  as touching and sound) as such stimulation may lead to an increase
  in disorientation. Agitation may be treated with valium. Phenothiazines
  such as haloperidol have been shown to decrease recovery time,
  but they may carry the increased risk of siezures (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  18</A>).</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><HR><FONT SIZE="+2">Subjective effects of PCP:</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The subjective effects of PCP can range from ecstatic bliss
  to psychotic episodes, depending on the particular user, their
  mental set, and the setting in which the drug is consumed. Recreational
  users frequently report euphoria, loss of ego boundries e.g.
  out of body experiences or &quot;astral projection&quot;, reduced
  ability to distinguish fantasy from reality, blurring of the
  distinction between inner and exterior stimulus, feelings of
  omnipotence, contact with supernatural entities, alteration of
  time perception and reality, etc. A representative user report
  is &quot;Life is dramatized onto a fantasy where you don't have
  to dream. Your wishes are fullfilled. What you want to happen
  comes true&quot;.</P>
  <P>When taken in relatively small doses of 5-10 mg by smoking,
  it produces prompt alterations in perception. Moderate (10-25
  mg) or high doses (greater than 20 mg), result in loss of consciousness.
  PCP can cause effects that mimic the full range of symptoms of
  schizophrenia, such as delusions, paranoia, disordered thinking,
  sensation of distance from one's environment, and catatonia.
  Speech is often sparse and garbled.</P>
  <P>Interesting effects on spacial visualization may occur, particularly
  alterations of body image. Examples of this are the production
  of &quot;microscopia&quot; and/or &quot;macroscopia&quot;, symptoms
  sometimes seen in schitzophrenic psychosis. These are conditions
  in which the concept of size becomes scrambled. Small objects
  can take on the impression of being enormous and large objects
  can be experienced as being infinitely small, even with the eyes
  closed. One experienced user has described this effect as rotating
  throughout the body, one leg seeming to be 10 miles long, or
  even boundless in space, while another portion of the body, such
  as the head may take on the impression of being microscopically
  small. This effect is not necessarily a visual phenominon, as
  may be more common under the influence of LSD or psilocybin,
  but rather a feeling more closely related to propioception itself.</P>
  <P>Another effect can be the production of temporary anterograde
  amnesia, in which the interpretation of time flow becomes altered.
  In this case, it may not be possible to distinguish whether an
  event has already happened, is currently happening, or is about
  to happen.</P>
  <P>Numbness, depersonalization, feelings of &quot;sheer nothingness&quot;
  and &quot;endless isolation&quot; are also possible. The most
  commonly seen effects include a feeling of inebriation and disorientation.
  Sometimes there is amnesia for the entire experience, although
  this is generally only at higher doses. Though visual, auditory,
  and tactile illusions and delusions (such as being God, the devil,
  or an animal) are common, actual hallucinations are relatively
  uncommon when compared with those produced by LSD.</P>
  <P>Habitual use of PCP or its derivatives should be strongly
  discouraged. Subtle residual mental effects can be apparent for
  weeks after one use, although this may be a positive effect to
  some users. This effect&nbsp;is shared with ketamine, where prolonged
  use can result in alterations of thought process not recognized
  by the users themselves (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  17</A>). Additionally, repeated use of PCP is well known to hamper
  short and long term memory. Because of the strong decrease in
  motor coordination and judgement, PCP should never be used when
  driving. Also, it should be noted that most fatalities associated
  with PCP are drownings, often when an individual enters the water
  prior to the full onset of effects.</P>
  <P>One aspect of PCP that has been enshrined in urban legend
  is the supposed ability of a user to have superhuman strength
  and be impervious to pain. There is some amount of truth to these
  claims. In several instances PCP users have actually been able
  to break handcuffs that were not defective, a force requiring
  1800 pounds per square inch if pulled straight or 450 psi if
  pulled at a 90 degree angle. Generally this resulted in fractured
  wrists or forearms.</P>
  <P>Additionally, it should be noted that PCP is well known to
  have psychologically addictive properties. In one study designed
  to assay the abuse potential of PCP derivatives, it was found
  that ketamine, PCE, and NPPCA (N-propyl-phenylcyclohexylamine)
  share this property. Since most people that experiment with PCP
  do not report adverse effects, and there is a large amount of
  data from clinical studies that demonstrate its safety, occasional
  use of the drug is classified as low risk. However, there is
  serious potential for negative consequences associated with chronic
  use. The consequences of psychological addiction can include
  profound shifts in personality and values, with realignment of
  philosophical/spiritual/moral outlooks to mesh with the percieved
  delerient effects. It has been noted that habitual users may
  develop strongly egocentric perspectives with a belief that previously
  hidden patterns in nature and reality are becoming apparent,
  i.e. the production of a God-like outlook. Also, the positive
  transformations in personality noted in Ketamine Psychedelic
  Therapy studies, such as increased spirituality and decreased
  fear of dying may be further enhanced to the point of becoming
  pathological. Other negative consequences that have been associated
  with chronic PCP abuse are memory loss, difficulties with speech
  and thinking, and depression, all of which can persist over a
  year after cessation of PCP use.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Drug Interactions:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P> PCP has sedative effects, and interactions with other central
  nervous system depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines
  can lead to coma or accidental overdose. There is also a profoundly
  synergystic interaction with THC. It has been noted among recreational
  users that smoking marijuana while under the influence of PCP
  can cause an extreme intensification and modification of the
  experience. Smoking more than a small amount of marijuana however,
  may lead to production of strong hangover-like symptoms.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Recreational Dosage range:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In individuals without built-up tolerence, the minimal dose
  capable of producing subjective effects is around 1 mg. 5-10
  mg is capable of producing the full spectrum of effects. 20 mg
  may put an individual into a comatose state, and 70 mg may induce
  seizures. Tolerence to effects is quickly produced by repeated
  use, and chronic users may ingest hundreds of milligrams a day
  for months at a time.</P>
  <P>PCP can be administered by any route, such as orally, injection,
  intranasally, and by smoking. The subjective effects produced
  are closely correlated with the speed at which the concentration
  increases in the bloodstream. This is analogous to the production
  of the euphoric rush from IV or inhaled opiates and stimulants,
  where this desired effect is more related to speed of increase
  in plasma levels, rather than the total plasma concentration.</P>
  <P>Thus, the route by which PCP is administered may have a profound
  effect on the experience. Oral administration is less common
  today than when PCP first appeared on the underground market
  in the 1960's. This method can lead to a much longer experience
  than other routes. Intensity of the experience by oral administration
  can also be very inconsistent, making it difficult to gauge dosage
  and resulting in increased possibility of overdosage. Snorting
  the drug results in increased speed of onset and better ability
  to achieve the desired effects without producing a cataleptic
  state. PCP may also be inhaled by smoking on parsely or other
  inert carrier. This results in very quick onset, and the effects
  may be continuously altered by additional inhalations. This is
  probably the safest method of administration.</P>
  <P>If PCP is administered intranasally, the particular salt form
  employed may have an effect on the rate at which it is absorbed,
  and consequently on the quality and length of the experience.
  Thus, snorting15 mg of PCP hydrobromide produces an onset of
  effects at 40 min. and a duration of action of ~3 hours, while
  snorting 15 mg of PCP hydrochloride gives an onset at about 5
  min., with a similar duration of action. There does seem to be
  a steep dose-response curve, as snorting 5 mg. of PCP HCl has
  an onset of about 30 min., and duration of about 1 hr.</P>
  <P>For smoking, PCP is best used as the freebase, in contrast
  to other routes, where it should be administered as the hydrochloride
  or other salt. Analogs of PCP which contain a secondary, rather
  than a tertiary amine, such as ketamine or PCE are best administered
  as the HCl salts even by smoking, because the vapors of the freebases
  are too caustic. </P>
