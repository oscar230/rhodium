  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Only a few PCP derivatives have been formally tested for activity
  in man, but there is a large amount of data available comparing
  the potency of various compounds in animals. A number of different
  assays have been used to evaluate the activity of PCP derivatives.
  Binding data at the noncompetitive NMDA receptor at which PCP
  binds and produces its characteristic effects (the &quot;PCP
  receptor&quot;), provides much of the potency data for the various
  compounds. However, it should be noted that this assay only measures
  the affinity of a compound for the receptor, and does not reveal
  whether a compound might have agonist or antagonist activity.
  Thus a compound that shows high affinity for the PCP receptor
  may not necessarily produce effects in animals similar to PCP.</P>
  <P>Data on the potency of PCP derivatives can also be derived
  from various <I>in vivo </I>pharmacological tests.Two of the
  most important are the rat rotorod and pigeon catalepsy tests,
  in which an animal is administered a test compound and its behavior
  observed. The most reliable data is obtained when both receptor
  binding assays and <EM>in vivo</EM> evaluation are compared.
  For the most part, receptor binding assays and <EM>in vivo</EM>
  evaluations agree closely as to whether a particular compound
  shows a PCP-like profile. However, there are some important exceptions
  (e.g. <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 25, 26</A>).</P>
  <P>It should be noted that the data presented here should not
  be used as an exact guide to potency, but rather as a rough comparison.
  Depending on the particular assay used, there may be a discrepency
  in the rank order of potency among the analogs, but generally
  the various tests are all able to predict whether a given compound
  is active at all.</P>
  <P>Also note that there are some subtle differences among the
  compound's behavioural effects in animals. For instance, the
  potent analogs TCP and PCPy (thienyl cyclohexylpiperidine and
  phenyl cyclohexylpyrrolidine) have been shown to increase ambulation
  in mice as well as producing a sedating &quot;taming&quot; effect
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 11</A>). PCE shows
  a similar, but smaller, increase in ambulation. This is in contrast
  to PCP, which causes a decrease in ambulation. This effect can
  be interpreted as an increased stimulant component of their action,
  and there is some anecdotal evidence that TCP has a more stimulant
  profile in man than PCP, although the effect is probably rather
  subtle (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 14</A>).</P>
  <P>The majority of analogs tested have reduced potency compared
  to PCP. For instance ketamine is only 1/10 as active as PCP.
  However, considering the potency of PCP, this is&nbsp;still respectable,
  giving an approximate dosage in man of 100 mg.</P>

of the amine substituent:</FONT></U></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>A. noncyclic alkyl substituents:</B> Replacement of the
  piperidine ring in PCP by other alkyl groups can lead to many
  active compounds. Removal of all N-alkyl substituents gives a
  compound about 1/2 as potent as PCP (1-phenylcyclohexylamine,
  PCA). Small alkyl substituents such as methyl and ethyl give
  compounds with increased potency relative to PCA. An N-methyl
  group gives a compound with about the same order of potency as
  PCP (possibly slightly lower). Lengthening the alkyl chain from
  methyl to ethyl increases the potency, and PCE is more active
  than PCP.</P>
  <P>Further increasing the chain length to n-propyl or n-butyl
  leads to a decrease in potency, although the n-propyl compound
  is still of similar potency to PCP.</P>
  <P>There is some evidence that smaller mono N-alkyl substituents
  such as methyl or ethyl lead to compounds with increased tendency
  to produce nausea. Additionally, the freebase of these analogs
  has a very unpleasant caustic taste when vaporized and inhaled,
  in contrast to the reportedly pleasant menthol flavor of PCP
  base. Formation of the HCl salts increases the palatability somewhat,
  although with PCE, there is still a distinctly unpleasant flavor
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 14</A>).</P>
  <P>The N-ethyl derivative of PCP (PCE, evaluated for anesthetic
  potential as CI-400 by Parke Davis Co.) began to be seen in clandestine
  labs in the US in 1970, following which it was legally scheduled.
  Another similar analog that has appeared on the illicit market
  in the US is the N-propyl homolog (PCPr), which has not been
  scheduled. The compound with an N-isopropyl substituent appears
  to have similar potency to PCP, but the N,N-dimethyl derivative
  may be only 1/2 the potency of PCP. The N,N-diethyl compound
  has more active in animal models than the dimethyl analog, but
  still less than PCP.</P>
  <P>An oxygen atom can be incorporated into the alkyl chain of
  the amino substituent to give a compound that retains activity.
  For instance, both the N-(2-methoxy-ethyl) and N-(3-methoxy-propyl)
  analogs are active in animal models (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  11</A>). The N-(2-hydroxy ethyl) analog has also been found on
  the street, and is presumably active.</P>
  <P><BR>
  <B>B. cyclic alkyl substituents:</B> Replacing the six-membered
  piperidine ring with the five-membered pyrrolidine ring gives
  the compound PCPy. This compound is only slightly less potent
  than PCP and has appeared on the street in both the US and Europe.
  It is now a schedule I controlled substance in the US. One report
  from a DEA internal publication mentions that although PCPy shows
  PCP-like activity in animals, it was found on the street to produce
  a barbituate-like intoxication and was not accepted (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  13</A>). However, recent uncontrolled experimentation in humans
  shows that the effects are at&nbsp;most only subtly different
  from PCP, and for the most part virtually indistinguishable (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 14</A>).</P>
  <P>Replacement of the piperidine ring with a morpholine ring
  produces a compound that is 1/10 the potency of PCP. In one study
  this compound was shown to be somewhat more potent than ketamine
  in animals trained to self-inject (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  48</A>).</P>
  <P>Alkyl substituents on a piperidine ring may also give active
  compounds. For instance the racemic 4-methyl and 3-methylpiperidine
  analogs retain about 1/3 of the activity of PCP. Increasing the
  size of the piperidine to a 7 membered ring (hexamethyleneimine)
  also gives a compound in the same order of potency as PCP. Some
  alkyl-substituted pyrrolidine analogs are also active, such as
  3,3-dimethylpyrrolidine.</P>

<P><A NAME="sarphenyl"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE="+1">2. Modification
of the aromatic (phenyl) ring:</FONT></U></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>a. Replacement of phenyl ring:</B> The phenyl ring of PCP
  can be replaced with a wide variety of other aromatic rings and
  maintain activity. Maintaining electron density in the ring appears
  to be vital to maintain activity. Substituting a 2-thienyl ring
  gives the compound TCP (1-thienylcyclohexylpiperidine, <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">fig.
  1</A>), which is up to four times as potent as PCP depending
  on the particular assay used. Subjective effects of TCP in man
  are almost indistinguishable from PCP, and only somewhat stronger
  on a weight basis (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  14</A>).</P>
  <P>Synthesis of TCP is easily accomplished by substitution of
  2-bromothiophene for bromobenzene in the grignard reaction. TCP
  was entered into schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act in
  the US in 1975, after it began to appear widely on the street
  beginning in 1972. Another analog that has appeared on the street
  and been placed into Schedule I is TCPy, or l-[l-(2-thienyl)cyclo-hexyl]cyclohexyl]pyrrolidine,
  the analog of PCP resulting from replacement of the piperidine
  ring with pyrrolidine and the phenyl ring with thiophene. This
  compound appears to be approximately as potent as PCP in animal
  tests.</P>
  <P><B>b. Addition of substituents to the phenyl ring:</B> Many
  PCP derivatives have been synthesized in which the phenyl ring
  carries various substituents. Only a few substituents are known
  that increase potency.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><STRONG>1. Substituents at the 3-postition of the phenyl ring:</STRONG>
    A 3-methoxy group gives a compound that is capable of producing
    effects in man that are extremely similar to PCP in potency and
    quality (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 14</A>).
    The 3-hydroxy compound however, has 8 times the affinity of PCP
    for its receptor but also has profoundly enhanced affinity for
    the opiate receptor (430 times the affinity of PCP), giving it
    an analgesic activity 1 order of magnitude lower than morphine.
    Substitution of the 3-OH&nbsp; group with an amino group results
    in other compounds with increased analgesic effects, again probably
    because of increased activity at an opiate receptor.</P>
    <P>Electron withdrawing groups seem to have a deactivating effect.
    A fluoro substituent or other halogen at the 3 position strongly
    reduces activity, as does a 3-nitro group. Howver, a methyl group
    at this position gives a compound that retains activity (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 11</A>).</P>
    <P><STRONG>2. Substituents at the 4-postition of the phenyl ring:
    </STRONG>In the 4-position, chloro, methyl, and nitro groups
    give inactive compounds. A 4-fluoro or 4-methoxy group results
    in a compound that is active but of somewhat reduced potency.
    A 4-hydroxy phenyl substituent appears to yield a compound that
    is at least as active as PCP, and possibly more so.</P>
    <P><STRONG>3. Substituents at the 2-postition of the phenyl ring:
    </STRONG>Ketamine is notable for possesing a 2-chloro group.
    This substituent most likely decreases overall potency of the
    compound, but may enhance analgesic activity. A 2-methoxy group
    may also give an active compound (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
    11</A>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="sarcyclo"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE="+1">3. Modification
of the cyclohexyl ring:</FONT></U></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The cyclohexyl ring appears to be the optimum size for maximum
  potency within PCP derivatives. Increasing or decreasing the
  size of the ring to cycloheptyl or cyclopentyl results in a drastic
  decrease in activity. However, increasing the size of the cyclohexane
  ring may increase the affinity of the compound at dopamine receptors,
  as discussed later.</P>
  <P>Ketamine (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methylamino-(2-cyclohexanone,
  <A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure1">figure 1</A>) has a carbonyl
  substituent at the two-position of the cyclohexane ring. This
  confers the desirable property of increasing elimination and
  decreasing the duration of anesthetic action, and may enhancie
  the analgesic potency. The veterinary anesthetic tiletamine (the
  N-ethyl 2-thienyl analog of Ketamine, <A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure1">figure
  1</A>) also has a carbonyl group at the same position.</P>
  <P>If the carbonyl group is moved to the 4-position of the cyclohexane
  ring, compounds that are active analgesics comparable to morphine
  can result, along with a reduction in PCP-like activity.</P>
  <P>Adding a 2 or especially 4-methyl substituent to the cyclohexane
  ring increases activity (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  54</A>). Adding a hydroxy group at any position decreases activity
  at the PCP receptor by a factor of 10 to 80.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>There are a number of PCP analogs that seem particularly promising
  for exploration. In trying to predict which analogs may appear
  as illicit drugs in the future, there are several factors to
  consider. 1). The compound should be predicted to be fairly potent,
  or there should be potency data available in the literature.
  2) The compound should not be previously scheduled as a controlled
  substance. 3) It should be easily synthesizable, preferably with
  inexpensive and readily available chemicals. </P>
  <P>Keeping these factors in mind, the following compounds may
  be particularly suitable candidates for clandestine synthesis:</P>
  <P>Analogs with a propyl or isopropyl amino substituent replacing
  the piperidine ring (N-propyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine and N-isopropyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine),
  as well as their thiophene counterparts. Also the N-ethyl homolog,
  N-ethyl thiophenylcyclohexylamine.</P>
  <P>Analogs with a 3-methoxyphenyl group are also good candidates,
  such as the piperidine, pyrrolidine, N-ethyl, and N-propyl analogs.
  </P>
  <P>Compounds with a 2 or 4-methyl cyclohexyl substituent will
  also be quite potent, although the cost of the starting material
  (2 or 4-methyl cyclohexanone) may be more expensive.</P>
