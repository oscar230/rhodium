  <P>This is the best route for synthesis of compounds with mono
  N-alkyl substituents, such as <A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure1">PCE</A>
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 10</A>). An intermediate
  imine is formed by the reaction of cyclohexanone and the appropriate
  primary amine. The phenyl group can then be introduced with phenyllithium<FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT>(<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  15, 16</A>). This route gives an overall yield of ~60%, with
  a difficulty rating of 2 out of 10 and a hazard rating of 3 out
  of 10 (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 64</A>).</P>
  <P>The monoalkyl analogs produced by this method can be further
  transformed to dialkyl derivatives if desired, by formylation
  or acetylation and reduction. Another variation on this route
  by which N,N-dialkyl analogs can be formed is the reaction of
  the intermediate imine with an alkyl halide to give a quaternary
  salt. This salt, upon reaction with phenyllithium gives the mixed
  N,N-dialkyl derivative of PCP (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  10, 11</A>). Another variation utilizes a primary amine and cyclohexanone,
  and traps the imine as a nitrile intermediate as in Scheme I
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 57</A>).</P>
  <P>PCE, as well as its N-methyl and N-propyl analogs have been
  produced in clandestine labs by this method. These analogs were
  of some popularity in the illicit drug trade during the1970's,
  but are now encountered infrequently.</P>

  <P>A mixture of 100 g of anhydrous ethylamine and 220 g of cyclohexanone
  was kept 16 hours, then shaken with solid KOH. The lower oil
  layer, which comprises the imine ( N-cyclohexylidenethylamine),
  was then removed by decantation. This intermediate is best used
  crude, but it can be distilled under good vacuum (bp 68-75 C
  at 22 mm Hg). The imine has also been prepared in illicit labs
  by stirring the amine and cyclohexanone in ether or toluene containing
  anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by filtration.</P>
  <P>Next, a solution of phenyllithium was prepared by adding 11
  g of lithium metal slowly to 76 ml bromobenzene in 500 ml of
  ether. This was added dropwise to a solution of 51 g of the N-cyclohexylidenethylamine
  in 500 ml of ether, with stirring and cooling to keep the temp
  at 0 deg C. The mixture was heated to reflux with stirring for
  one hour, and then decomposed by addition of water. The ether
  layer was separated, washed with water, and extracted into dilute
  HCl. The acid layers were basified with NaOH and extracted back
  into organic solvent. The solvent can now be evaporated to yield
  N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE) freebase. This can be purified
  by vacuum distillation (bp 104-108 at 2.5 mm Hg).</P>
  <P>The HCl salt of PCE can be prepared by dissolving the base
  in isopropanol, gassing with HCl, and adding ether slowly to
  precipitate the salt. The salt can be purified by recrystallization
  from a mixture of isopropanol and ether (mp 236-237 C).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
