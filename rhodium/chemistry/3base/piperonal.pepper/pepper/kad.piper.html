<p><b>Botanical Source.</b>&#151;Piper nigrum is a perennial vine
with a trailing or climbing stem, round, smooth, shrubby,
flexuose, dichotomously branched, jointed, swelling at the
joints, and often throwing out radicles there which adhere to
bodies like the roots of ivy, or become roots striking into the
ground. The leaves are from 4 to 6 inches long, alternate,
distichous, broad-ovate, acuminate, of a dark-green color, glossy
above, paler beneath, 5 to 7 nerved, the nerves connected by
lesser transverse ones or veins, and prominent beneath; the
petioles are round, and from 1 to 1 inch long. The flowers are
whitish, small, not stalked, and borne in spikes opposite the
leaves, chiefly near the upper ends of the branches, pedunculate,
3 to 6 inches long, slender, drooping, apparently some male,
others female, while sometimes the flowers are furnished with
both stamens and pistils. Stamens 3. The fruit ripens irregularly
all the year round, is sessile, the size of a pea, at first
green, then red, and afterward black, covered by pulp (L.).</p>

<p><b>History and Description.</b>&#151;Piper nigrum is a native
of the East Indian continent, notably the Malabar coast, as well
as of many islands in the Indian ocean, where it is extensively
cultivated, as well as in the West Indies. Commercial grades are
known as <i>Malabar, Singapore, Penang, Sumatra pepper</i>, etc.
The berries are collected while red, before they have fully
matured, and when dried, form the, <i>black pepper </i>of
commerce; when allowed to ripen, and then divested of their husks
by being soaked in water, dried, rubbed and winnowed, they
constitute <i>white pepper</i>, which is less pungent and
aromatic than the black. Sumatra and Java furnish the principal
portion of the black pepper met with in this country and Europe.
The berries, which are about the size of a currant, are
officially described as &quot;globular, about 4 Mm. (<font size="2">1/6</font> inch) in diameter, reticulately wrinkled,
brownish-black or grayish-black, internally lighter, hollow, with
an undeveloped embryo; odor aromatic; taste pungently spicy&quot;&#151;(U.
S. P.). Alcohol or ether extracts their virtues completely; water
only partially.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Composition.</b>&#151;The sharp taste of pepper is
due to the presence of about 6 to 8 per cent of the weak alkaloid
<i>piperine </i>(C<font size="1">17</font>H<font size="1">19</font>NO<font size="1">3</font>) which in substance is almost tasteless, but
develops its sharp taste when in solution. White pepper seems to
contain even more piperine than black. Piperine, when boiled with
alcoholic caustic potash, is decomposed into the potassium-salt
of <i>piperic acid </i>(C<font size="1">12</font>H<font size="1">10</font>O<font size="1">4</font>), and into the powerfully basic <i>piperidine </i>(C<font size="1">5</font>H<font size="1">11</font>N) (see <a href="../piperine/kad.piperinum.html"><i>Piperinum</i></a>). According
to T. Weigle (<i>Chem. Zeitung</i>, 1893, p. 1365), the sharp
taste of the fresh fruit is produced by the piperine being
dissolved in the essential oil; old fruits taste less sharp owing
to partial resinification of the essential oil and consequent
partial crystallization of piperine. The odor of the fruit is due
to the essential oil (<i>oil of pepper</i>) which is devoid of
sharp taste. From 1 to 2.3 per cent may be obtained from the
powdered fruit by distillation with water. It is colorless to
yellowish green, slightly laevo-rotatory and has a specific
gravity of 0.880 to 0.905. Its principal constituent is <i>laevo-phellandrene
</i>(Schimmel &amp; Co., 1890). The pepper fruit also contains
cellulose, large quantities of starch (as much as 32 per cent),
some coloring matter and a viscid, non-saponifiable, tasteless
and almost odorless oil (C<font size="1">10</font>H<font size="1">16</font>O<font size="1">4</font>), probably formed from the essential oil by
oxidation. It is soluble in alcohol of 90 per cent, in ether, and
petroleum ether; piperine is hardly soluble in the latter solvent
(Weigle). Pepper fruit dried at 100° C. (212° F.), leaves from
3.2 to 5.7 per cent of ash; its average is 4.5 per cent. Tannin
is absent in the pepper fruit. Buchheim (1876) obtained from the
pepper fruit, besides <i>piperine</i>, an amorphous alkaloid <i>chavicine
</i>soluble in alcohol, ether and petroleum ether. Alcoholic
caustic alkali decomposes it into the alkali salt of <i>chavicic
acid, </i>and <i>piperidine </i>(compare <i>Piperinum</i>).</p>

<p><b>Adulterations and Tests.</b>&#151;Falsification of the
whole pepper fruit is of rare occurrence. It may be found
occasionally admixed with the fruit of cubebs, allspice, piper
longum, etc. A globular iron ore (<i>bean-ore</i>) has been
reported as an adulterant of whole pepper (<i>Chem. Zeitung</i>,
1880, p. 1030). Adulteration of powdered pepper may be recognized
by the microscope and by chemical methods. The determination of
ether extract, representing the piperine and resin, in
conjunction with the determination of ash may be useful in
deciding the purity of a given sample. Mr. J. E. S. Bell (<i>Amer.
Jour. Pharm.</i>, 1888, p. 481) found sixteen out of twenty
samples of pepper, mostly from American markets, to be pure. The
ether extract in the four impure samples varied from 3.29 to 4.11
per cent, the ash from 7.25 to 8.59 per cent, while in pure
pepper it varies from 3 to 5 per cent. The highest yield of ether
extract was 7.85 per cent. Genuine black pepper should yield 7.66
per cent piperine (Niederstadt). T. F. Hanausek (1884) mentions
among adulterants of powdered pepper, crust of bread, flour,
linseed cake, acorn meal, sawdust, powdered olive kernels; of
late (1898), powdered exhausted coriander fruit, less frequently
mineral matters, such as sand, gypsum, etc. Mr. F. A. Hennessy (<i>Amer.
Jour. Pharm.</i>, 1890, p. 276) reports on the wholesale
manufacture of &quot;spice mixture&quot; from a low grade of
wheat flour. Also see an interesting article on &quot;poivrette,&quot;
an adulterant of powdered pepper made from olive kernels, in <i>Amer.
Jour. Pharm.</i>, 1887, p. 146. (For a detailed consideration of
the microscopical and chemical analysis of pepper, see J. König,
<i>Die Menschl. Nahrungs- und Genussmittel</i>, 3d ed., 1893, p.
673; also see literature in Flückiger's <i>Pharmacognosie</i>, 3d
ed., 1891, p. 914.)</p>

<p><b>Action, Medical Uses, and Dosage.</b>&#151;Pain and redness
are the results of the local application of powdered pepper.
Internally administered it excites in the mouth and fauces a
burning sensation, warms the stomach and slightly quickens the
circulation. Abdominal heat and burning, marked thirst, vomiting,
fever, and sometimes convulsions follow an excessive dose. It may
produce an urticaria, which, however, soon disappears. Large
doses increase renal activity and irritate the urinary tract.
Black pepper is a gastro-intestinal stimulant, and is much used
as a condiment to improve the flavor of food, and to favor its
digestion by stimulating the stomach. It has been advantageously
used as a carminative to remove <i>flatulency</i>, and to correct
the nauseating or griping quality of other drugs, and is
sometimes added to quinine in cases where the stomach, from
torpidity or other cause, is not acted upon by the quinine alone.
It has been recommended as a remedy in <i>intermittents</i>, but
very often fails, though it nearly always materially assists the
action of quinine. As a gastric stimulant it is very valuable in <i>congestive
chill, cholera morbus, </i>and associated with hydrastis, nux
vomica, or other stomachic bitters is effectual in <i>atonic
dyspepsia</i>. Combined with macrotys it has rendered good
service in <i>atonic amenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea</i>. The
unbroken seeds of white pepper taken in teaspoonful doses 2 or 3
times a day, have been recommended to overcome the <i>obstinate
constipation of dyspeptics</i>; they are, however, rarely used at
present.</p>

<p>The dose of black pepper is from 1 to 15 grains. Prof.
Scudder, with whom black pepper was a favorite drug, directs from
1 to 10 drops of the following tincture: Take finely ground black
pepper, zviii; alcohol, 98 per cent, Oj. Pack the drug in a
percolator, moisten with a portion of the alcohol, allow it to
stand a day, and then pass through it the remaining portion of
alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Specific Indications and Uses.</b>&#151;Gastric atony;

<p><b>Related Peppers.</b>&#151;L<font size="2">ONG </font>P<font size="2">EPPER</font>. This pepper is derived from two species of
Piper, <i>Piper officinarum</i>, De Candolle (<i>Chavica
officinarum</i>, Miquel), producing the Java long pepper, and <i>Piper
longum</i>, Linné (<i>Chavica Roxburghii</i>, Miquel) producing
the India long pepper. Both species grow in the islands of the
Indian Ocean, the latter species also in the Philippine Islands,
in southern India, Malabar, Bengal and Ceylon.</p>

<p>The <i>Java long pepper </i>grows in cylindrical aments
consisting of a multitude of minute ovoid berries, each <font size="2">1/10</font> of an inch long, densely arranged in spiral
form around a common axis, the whole spike being about 1 <font size="1">1/2</font> to 2 inches long and <font size="2">1/4</font>
inch thick and of an ashen gray color. When washed they are
reddish brown. The fruits are collected before maturity, dried in
the sun, and have a mild aromatic odor but a pungent, aromatic
taste.</p>

<p><i>India long pepper </i>is of similar growth, but its spikes
are shorter, only from 1 to 1 <font size="1">1/2</font> inch in
length, and the fruits are less pungent. Its aromatic taste and
odor are gradually developed upon drying. It is less esteemed
than the Java variety. Long pepper contains piperine (Winkler,
1828; Flückiger, <i>Pharmacognosie</i>, 1891), and yields upon
distillation with water, 1 per cent of a bland, thickish, yellow-green
oil of specific gravity 0.861, and resembling ginger in odor.
Long pepper is rarely used medicinally in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Piper Novae-Hollandae</i>.&#151;Australia. The berries of
this pepper contain an essential oil reputed useful in <i>gonorrhoea
</i>and related disorders.</p>
