<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> The propagation of open
pollinated seed from two camphor trees with a high <br>
camphor and linalool content, resp., yielded 115 progeny. The
chem. compn. of the <br>
leaf oils of these trees was analyzed by a combination of
capillary GC and GC/MS. <br>
Four chemotypes could be distinguished among the 57 trees
cultivated from a single <br>
mother tree rich in camphor [Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Sieb.]. The
first group (23 <br>
trees) was rich in camphor (62-93%), and the second group (13
progeny) contained <br>
1,8-cineole and a-terpineol as major compds. (30-57% and 14-25%,
resp.). Thirteen <br>
trees yielded oils rich in (E)-nerolidol and 9-oxonerolidol (47-84%).
The oils of <br>
eight other trees also contained (E)-nerolidol and 9-oxonerolidol
(22-36%) but <br>
contained higher proportions of safrole (30-70%). The leaf oils
of 58 individual <br>
trees propagated from another mother tree which was rich in
linalool [C. camphora <br>
(L.) Sieb. var. linaloolifera], indicated the presence of six
chemotypes. Most of <br>
the progeny, 33 trees, contained oils rich in linalool (72-96%),
and seven trees <br>
yielded oils contg. camphor as major constituent (70-86%). The
oils from eight <br>
trees contained mainly (E)-nerolidol and 9-oxonerolidol (61-91%),
while those from <br>
six progeny contained a mixt. of camphor (19-71%) and linalool (14-72%).
Three <br>
trees yielded oils rich in 1,8-cineole (54-56%), b-pinene (16-24%)
and a-terpineol <br>
(9-11%). The oil of one tree was characterized by the significant
presence of <br>
linalool (38%), 1,8-cineole (36%) and b-pinene (11%).<br>

<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> In total, 15 essential oil
samples of the species Cinnamomum (Lauraceae) <br>
from various origin were investigated using gas chromatog.-spectroscopic
(GC/FID and <br>
GC/MS) and olfactoric methods. The objective of these analyses
was the detn. of the <br>
content of (E)-cinnamaldehyde (main compd. of cinnamon bark oils),
eugenol (main <br>
compd. of the cinnamon leaf oils), o-methoxycinnamaldehyde and
cinnamyl acetate as <br>
well as of the crit. components coumarin and safrole in order to
make statements <br>
about the quality (pharmacopoeia-quality) and the legal (EU aroma-directice
<br>
88/388/EEC inclusively the new regulations of max. limits in
annex II) use of these <br>
oils. Four com. available essential cinnamon bark oils and three
essential cinnamon <br>
leaf oils were found to be unobjectionable and can be used as
aroma in foodstuffs <br>
and beverages as well as in pharmaceutical prepns.<br>

<strong>&quot;miscellaneous phenols in foods and beverages<br>
- nature, occurrence and dietary burden&quot;</strong><br>
michael n clifford<br>
(School of Biological Sciences, University of Surrey, Surrey GU2
5XH, UK)<br>
<br>
<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> A review with 150 refs. Some
phenols are of restricted botanical <br>
occurrence (e.g., arbutin) whereas others are widespread minor
components (e.g., <br>
coumarins, phenylpropanoids). A few occur at comparatively high
levels in certain <br>
commodities (e.g., eugenol in cloves). Some have been little
studied (e.g., <br>
phlorotannins) whereas others have been extensively studied
because their <br>
consumption (e.g., safrole) or topical contact (e.g., psoralen
and the urushiols) <br>
has long been assocd. with adverse effects. Some are permitted
food additives <br>
(e.g., cochineal, cinnamoylmethanes), whereas permission to use
some others (e.g., <br>
coumarin, alkannet and safrole) has been withdrawn due to
evidence of adverse <br>
effects. Some of these phenols are advocated as natural remedies
(e.g., eugenol or <br>
capsaicins) or dietary supplements (e.g., methoxypsoralen). It is
a cause for <br>
concern that the margin of safety between a safe dose and the min.
dose producing <br>
significant adverse effects is narrower in some cases than would
be tolerated for a <br>
food additive (e.g., psoralen). For others such as the
alkenylresorcinols, <br>
capsaicins, and phlorotannins, little or nothing is known about
the burden, metab. <br>
and biol. effects.<br>

<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> the root bark of sassafras
albidum (nuttall) nees (lauraceae) was extracted<br>
at room temperature with hexane and chloroform as solvents. The
isolated essential oils<br>
were analyzed with GC and GC/MS. thirty compounds were
identified, nine of which have<br>
not been previously reported from this species. the major
compounds were safrole (85%),<br>
camphor (3.25%), and methyleugenol (1.10%). ten sesquiterpenes
were also identified.</p>

<strong>&quot;liquid chromatographic determination of safrole in
sassafras-derived herbal products&quot;</strong><br>
Carlson M, Thompson RD.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> A liquid chromatographic (LC)
method was developed for determining safrole in <br>
herbal products derived from sassafras (Sassafras albidum), as
well as related compounds <br>
such as isosafrole and dihydrosafrole. The procedure involves
solvent extraction and <br>
isolation of analyte by reversed-phase LC with UV detection at
235 nm. Safrole is resolved <br>
from related compounds and other sample constituents including
thymol, a component of thyme. <br>
A linear concentration range of 0.003-0.200 mg/mL was obtained
for safrole, isosafrole, and <br>
dihydrosafrole. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ)
were e0.0015 and 0.0051 <br>
micrograms/mL for safrole, 0.0018 and 0.0061 micrograms/mL for
isosafrole, and 0.0038 and <br>
0.0125 micrograms/mL for dihydrosafrole, respectively. Intraday
relative standard deviations <br>
(RSDs) for safrole (n = 5) from various samples ranged from 1.30
to 5.39% at analyte levels <br>
of 0.01-1.5%. Safrole contents of 26 samples including root bark
powder, leaves, oils, tea <br>
concentrate, herbal extract tinctures, and herbal powder capsules
ranged from &lt; LOD for most<br>
leaf samples to 92.4% for an oil. Recoveries of safrole from
fortified samples ranged from <br>
83.6% for an oil to 117.2% for a tincture preparation. Safrole
contents of 0.09-4.66 mg/cup <br>
were found for brewed teas prepared from sassafras root bark
powders and tinctures.</p>
