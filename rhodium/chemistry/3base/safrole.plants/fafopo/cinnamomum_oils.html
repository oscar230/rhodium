<h2>CINNAMOMUM OILS (INCLUDING CINNAMON AND CASSIA)</h2>

<p><i>Cinnamomum</i> is a large genus, many species of which
yield a volatile oil on distillation. The composition of the oil,
and therefore its value and the use to which it is put, depends
very much on the species that is distilled as well as the part of
the plant which is utilized. The most important <i>Cinnamomum</i>
oils in world trade are those from <i>C. verum</i> (cinnamon bark
and leaf oils), <i>C. cassia</i> (cassia oil) and <i>C. camphora</i>
(sassafras and Ho leaf oils). The latter species provides oils
which are utilized as sources of chemical isolates. </p>

<p>However, a number of other <i>Cinnamomum</i> species are
distilled on a much smaller scale and the oils used either
locally or exported to regional markets. Given the large number
of <i>Cinnamomum</i> species that exist, their widespread
distribution in Asia, and the number still not characterised in
terms of essential oil content and composition, the genus has
much potential for providing new tree crops in developing
countries. </p>

<p>The spice oils cinnamon and cassia are discussed first. An
indication is then given of the types of oil found in other <i>Cinnamomum
</i>species, including <i>C. camphora</i>, and those with the
greatest perceived potential for future use. </p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION AND USES</h3>

<p><br>
<b>Cinnamon bark</b> oil possesses the delicate aroma of the
spice and a sweet and pungent taste. Its major constituent is
cinnamaldehyde but other, minor components impart the
characteristic odour and flavour. It is employed mainly in the
flavouring industry where it is used in meat and fast food
seasonings, sauces and pickles, baked goods, confectionery, cola-type
drinks, tobacco flavours and in dental and pharmaceutical
preparations. Perfumery applications are far fewer than in
flavours because the oil has some skin-sensitizing properties,
but it has limited use in some perfumes. </p>

<p><b>Cinnamon leaf</b> oil has a warm, spicy, but rather harsh
odour, lacking the rich body of the bark oil. Its major
constituent is eugenol rather than cinnamaldehyde. It is used as
a flavouring agent for seasonings and savory snacks. As a cheap
fragrance it is added to soaps and insecticides. The oil's high
eugenol content also makes it valuable as a source of this
chemical for subsequent conversion into iso-eugenol, another
flavouring agent. </p>

<p><b>Cassia oil</b> is distilled from a mixture of leaves, twigs
and fragments of bark. Cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent
and it is used mainly for flavouring cola-type drinks, with
smaller amounts used in bakery products, sauces, confectionery
and liqueurs. Like cinnamon bark oil, its use as a fragrance is
limited by its skin sensitizing properties. </p>

<h3>WORLD SUPPLY AND DEMAND TRENDS</h3>

<h4>Markets</h4>

<p><b>Cinnamon bark</b> oil is a high-value essential oil but the
volumes traded are very low. In the ten years since 1983 exports
from Sri Lanka, virtually the only supplier of the oil, have
never been more than 2.8 tonnes. Exports from Sri lanka for the
six years 1987-92, together with their destinations, are shown in
Table 1. </p>

<p>The major market is the EC, within which France is the biggest
importer. In recent years the United States has emerged as the
second largest importing country. </p>

<p>World demand for <b>cinnamon leaf</b> oil has been around 120-150
tonnes pa in recent years, met almost entirely by Sri Lanka. Sri
Lankan exports (Table 2) have averaged about 120 tonnes pa for
the period 1987-92, but this includes an exceptionally low output
in 1990. </p>

<p>The United States and Western Europe are the largest markets
for cinnamon leaf oil. Imports into France and the UK have fallen
in the last few years, as they have slightly for India. Hong Kong
is a significant importer although most of the oil is re-exported.
</p>

<p>The ready availability of eugenol ex clove leaf oil has led to
some loss in markets for cinnamon leaf oil. When eugenol is
required for further conversion into iso-eugenol, that produced
from cinnamon leaf oil possesses a more desirable aroma and
flavour than when derived from clove leaf oil. For most other
purposes, however, the cheaper eugenol ex clove leaf oil is
preferred. </p>

<p>Estimation of world demand for cassia oil is complicated by
the fact that export data are not available from the People's
Republic of China, the major producer. Furthermore, the oil is
only separately specified in import statistics of the USA and
Japan, although these are known to be the major markets. </p>

<p>The levels of imports of cassia oil into the USA are shown in
Table 3 for the period 1987-93. </p>

<p>Imports into the USA have risen in recent years and, with a
soft drinks market which shows no sign of weakening, demand for
cassia oil is expected to remain strong. Imports from Japan and
Hong Kong are almost entirely re-exports of Chinese oil. </p>

<p>Japanese imports of cassia oil have averaged 60 tonnes pa for
the six years 1988-93, virtually all of it coming directly from
the People's Republic of China. A significant proportion of the
imports are re-exported (to the USA, for example, above). </p>

<h4>Supply sources</h4>

<p>Sri Lanka is the only regular supplier of <b>cinnamon bark</b>
and <b>leaf oils</b>. With the exception of 1990, when both oils
were in short supply, production (as reflected in exports) has
remained very constant for bark oil, with a slight downward trend
for leaf oil. Internal consumption is small so that production
levels are not much greater than exports. </p>

<p>Madagascar and the Seychelles have been intermittent suppliers
of leaf oil on a very minor scale in the past. India produces
very small amounts of leaf oil for domestic use. </p>

<p>Most cassia oil in international trade is of Chinese origin.
There is believed to be significant domestic consumption so total
annual production may be in excess of 500 tonnes. </p>

<p>Small quantities of cassia oil are produced in Indonesia, Viet
Nam, India and Nepal but these are obtained from species of <i>Cinnamomum</i>
other than <i>C. cassia</i> (see PLANT SOURCES) and are much less
widely traded than Chinese oil. </p>

<h4>Quality and prices</h4>

<p>There is no international standard for <b>cinnamon bark oil</b>
although batches containing cinnamaldehyde at the higher end of
the range fetch the higher price. In the United States, an EOA
standard specifies an aldehyde content of 55-78 percent. </p>

<p>International (ISO) standards exist for cinnamon leaf and
cassia oils. For <b>cinnamon leaf oil</b>, ranges between which
the major constituent, eugenol, should fall are specified in
terms of total phenol content for oils of different origin. Oil
from the Seychelles used to be preferred because of its high
eugenol content (<i>ca</i> 90 percent). In practice, Sri Lanka
now accounts for almost all of the oil in international trade and
the standard specifies a 75-85 percent phenol content. Another
constituent of the oil which contributes to its aromatic
character is cinnamaldehyde and for Sri Lankan oil a maximum
level of 5 percent is specified. Physico-chemical requirements
are also given. </p>

<p>In the United States an FMA monograph, which replaces the old
EOA standard, specifies the eugenol content of cinnamon leaf oil
in terms of its solubility in potassium hydroxide (80-88 percent).
</p>

<p>For <b>cassia oil</b>, cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent
and a minimum content of 80 percent is specified in the ISO
standard. Again, physico-chemical data are provided. </p>

<p><b>Cinnamon bark</b> oil is considerably more expensive than
the leaf oil and probably the most highly priced of all essential
oils. During 1992 it was being offered at around US$385/kg,
largely reflecting the high raw material cost. In 1993 and early
1994 dealers in London were only quoting prices on request. </p>

<p><b>Cinnamon leaf oil</b>, in contrast, has been in the range
US$6.50-7.50/kg for most of the last three years. Its price fell
gradually from about US$7.50 in early 1991 to US$6.50 in mid-1993.
In late 1993 it had risen again to US$7.30/kg and in early 1994
it was US$8.25/kg. Although it is a comparatively low-priced oil
it is still more expensive than clove leaf oil as a source of
eugenol (which was approximately US$2.70/kg in early 1994). </p>

<p><b>Cassia oil</b>, too, has remained fairly level in price
over the last few years. In the period early 1991 to mid-1993 it
fetched US$33-35/kg. It then fell slightly and in early 1994 it
was about US$29/kg. These prices are significantly lower than
those which prevailed in the early and mid-1980s, when there was
a shortage of cassia bark in the People's Republic of China. Any
appreciable rise in price above the US$30-35/kg level is likely
to encourage end-users to blend cheaply available synthetic
cinnamaldehyde with natural cassia oil. </p>

<h4>Description and distribution</h4>

<p>The genus <i>Cinnamomum</i> comprises several hundred species
which occur naturally in Asia and Australia. They are evergreen
trees and shrubs and most species are aromatic. <i>C. verum</i>,
the source of cinnamon bark and leaf oils, is a tree indigenous
to Sri Lanka, although most oil now comes from cultivated areas.
Smaller areas of wild trees are found in southwestern parts of
India. <i>C. cassia</i>, the source of internationally traded
cassia oil, occurs wild as a bush in the mountains of southern
China but is now cultivated for oil production, mainly in the
provinces of Kwangsi and Kwangtung. </p>

<p>The other cassias occur wild on the islands of Sumatra and
Java, Indonesia (<i>C. burmannii</i>); in Viet Nam (<i>C.
loureirii</i>); and India and Nepal (<i>C. tamala</i>). In all
cases the trees are also cultivated. </p>

<p><b>Effects of oil production on the natural resource</b> </p>

<p>Most of the above oils are now derived almost entirely from
cultivated sources and there is no longer pressure on the wild
resource. </p>

<h3>HARVESTING/PRIMARY PROCESSING</h3>

<p><i>Cinnamomum</i> usually coppices well and commercial
production of the bark spices entails cutting the stems low down
after an initial establishment period and harvesting the bushy re-growth
stems at regular intervals thereafter. In Sri Lanka, a first
harvest may be obtained after 3-4 years, although both quality
and yields improve with subsequent cutting. The stems are cut
during the rainy season to facilitate peeling of the bark.
Details of harvesting practice differ slightly from country to
country but the basic principles are the same. Strips of bark are
then formed into the familiar compound quills (cinnamon) or
hollow quills (cassia) of the spices. </p>

<p>In Sri Lanka, <b>cinnamon bark</b> oil is produced by
distillation of chips and variable amounts of featherings (pieces
of inner bark from twigs and twisted shoots) and quillings (broken
fragments of quills). In many cases the older form of hydro-distillation
is used in which chips and water are placed together in the
distillation vessel which is heated by direct fire. The oil
distils over in two fractions, one lighter and one heavier than
water, and a form of cohobation is used to recover residual oil
from the distillation waters. More modern methods involve steam
distillation. </p>

<p>The leaves left after trimming the cut stems, as well as those
obtained from pruning operations, provide the raw material for
production of <b>cinnamon leaf oil</b>. They are usually allowed
to dry for a few days before distillation. Traditional stills in
Sri Lanka are large wooden vessels capable of holding up to 200
kg of leaves, on top of which is fitted a copper still head.
Steam is introduced from a separate wood-fired boiler. In some
cases, all-metal vessels are used and water-steam distillation is
employed. </p>

<p>Chinese cassia oil is produced by hydro-distillation of
leaves, twigs and fragments of bark. </p>

<h4>Yields and quality variation</h4>

<p>For cinnamon and cassia oils there is more potential than
usual for variation in oil yields and quality and this makes it
difficult to cite typical data. Not only is there the expected
intrinsic variation due to different geographical origins of the
source raw material, but the composition of the charge that is
distilled is liable to vary, particularly in the case of cinnamon
bark oil and cassia oil. The method of distillation used (steam
vs water-steam vs hydro-distillation) and other differences in
distillation practice give rise to further causes of variation. </p>

<h3>VALUE-ADDED PROCESSING</h3>

<p>Cinnamon and cassia oils are both normally rectified within
the importing country before sale to end-users in order to give a
cleaner product or to provide an oil with more uniform
composition. Rectification is also required to produce feedstock
eugenol for subsequent derivative manufacture. </p>

<h3>PRODUCTS OTHER THAN OIL</h3>

<p>The major incentive to cultivation of <i>C. verum</i> and <i>C.
cassia</i> has been their value as spice crops, for which world
demand is considerable (tens of thousands of tonnes of bark
annually). Indonesian cassia (<i>C. burmanii</i>) is much more
important as a spice than as a source of oil and enters
international trade along with Chinese cassia. There is some
production of oleoresin for flavouring purposes, chiefly in North
America from the cheaper Indonesian cassia. Bark also finds local
use medicinally, particularly in the People's Republic of China. </p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENTAL POTENTIAL</h3>

<p>For the cinnamon and cassia oils of international commerce,
production of oil is secondary to the production of the spice.
The establishment of new areas of these particular <i>Cinnamomum</i>
species will depend upon demand for the spice and economic
returns to the farmer. Whether &quot;waste&quot; material from
spice production is then utilized for oil production is, again,
dependent on demand, prevailing oil prices and economic returns.
The close relationship between the two commodities makes it
unlikely that production of oil will shift, geographically, from
the traditional centres of spice production. </p>

<h4>Research needs</h4>

<p>Apart from improvements in distillation practice, the greatest
advances in productivity and quality will come from breeding
programmes aimed at producing superior germplasm for planting.
Some progress has already been made in identifying mother plants
which give high yields of oil and high cinnamaldehyde and eugenol
contents in the bark and leaves (GURUSINGHE and KIRINDE, 1985)
and this work needs to be continued. </p>

<h3>OILS FROM OTHER CINNAMOMUM SPECIES</h3>

<p>The diversity of <i>Cinnamomum</i> as a genus, although not as
great as, say, <i>Eucalyptus</i>, has analogies with the latter
in terms of the variety of chemical types of volatile oil that
may be distilled from the plants. Like <i>Eucalyptus</i>, the
same species of <i>Cinnamomum</i> can afford oils with quite
different compositions according to the population being studied,
i.e. it may exist as different chemotypes. <i>C. camphora</i> is
a well-known example and the wood from different groups of trees
may yield camphor, linalool, safrole or cineole as the major
chemical upon distillation. </p>

<p>This diversity, coupled with the ability of most <i>Cinnamomum</i>
to respond to coppicing (a system of management which enables it
to be harvested on a sustainable basis), and a market that is
always receptive to new, alternative sources of natural aroma
chemicals, makes <i>Cinnamomum</i> one of the most promising
areas for research. The increasing number of reports in the
scientific literature describing the oil characteristics of <i>Cinnamomum</i>
species is evidence of the attention they are receiving in
screening programmes. </p>

<p>Table 4 gives some examples of <i>Cinnamomum</i> species which
are, or might be, used as sources of commercially valuable
chemical isolates. </p>

<p><b><i>Cinnamomum camphora</i></b> </p>

<p><i>C. camphora</i> was heavily exploited as a source of
camphor in Japan and Taiwan until the Second World War. Trees
were felled and logs, stumps and branches distilled to give
crystalline camphor and camphor oil. The species was introduced
into India during the 1950s. Although yields of camphor are
greater for old trees, leaves and woody material can be harvested
regularly from plants over five years of age which are kept in a
bushy form by coppicing. This form of harvesting is carried out
in the People's Republic of China. The availability of cheap
synthetic camphor (ex turpentine), however, has meant that there
is now only modest international demand for the natural form.
This, combined with the availability of competitively priced
Chinese camphor (US$3.65/kg in early 1994) does not make its
production elsewhere particularly attractive. </p>

<p>The use of <i>C. camphora</i> as a source of Ho leaf oil, on
the other hand, has expanded in recent years and it is now an
important source of natural linalool (which is still preferred
over the synthetic form for some fragrance applications). Chinese
Ho oil has largely displaced the use of rosewood as a source of
natural linalool. </p>

<p>Fractionation of the camphor-free oil obtained from <i>C.
camphora</i> provides an oil rich in safrole. This is usually
described as Chinese sassafras oil (see SASSAFRAS OIL). </p>

<p>Other <i>Cinnamomum</i> speciesThe ease with which essential
oils can be obtained from plant material (and subsequently
analyzed in the laboratory) makes them ideal candidates for study
as potential cash crops. A screening programme currently underway
at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia focuses on essential
oils of indigenous flora and has already examined several <i>Cinnamomum</i>
species. Some are considered to have economic potential in
providing raw materials for local industry and income to farmers
who might grow them. <i>C. mollissimum</i> leaves, for example,
contain an oil which is rich in benzyl benzoate and could find
application in insecticidal preparations. The trunkwood could
possibly be harvested for mucilage on a coppice system (for
mosquito coil manufacture), in the same way as <i>C. iners</i> is
already being grown in Malaysia. </p>

<p><i>Cinnamomum </i>species other than <i>C. camphora</i> which
contain safrole in their leaves have potential for utilization,
providing oil yields and safrole content are high enough to make
its recovery worthwhile from an economic point of view. </p>

<p>Leaves of <i>C. tamala</i> (tejpat) are widely used in
northern India as a spice but also furnish an essential oil on
distillation and this finds some local use. Several chemotypes
exist, producing oils rich in cinnamaldehyde or eugenol, but the
existence of cheap supplies of these chemicals from other sources
(eugenol-rich clove leaf oil from Indonesia, for example) means
that <i>C. tamala</i> oil is unlikely to find wider international
use. </p>

<p>Similarly, cineole-rich oils from <i>Cinnamomum</i> cannot
compete with <i>Eucalyptus</i> oils. </p>

<p>The oils of some other <i>Cinnamomum</i> species are employed
in whole form for perfumery use although this is usually in a
domestic, rather than international context (e.g. <i>C. porrectum</i>
oil, which is rich in neral/geranial, is distilled in the
People's Republic of China). Nevertheless, the existence of a
local market may be sufficient to encourage small-scale
production of such oils. <i>C. osmophloeum</i> is being studied
in Taiwan as a possible substitute for cassia oil in the food
industry. </p>
