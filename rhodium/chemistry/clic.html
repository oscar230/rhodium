<P><B>“An Unsuccessful Clandestine Synthesis Of Amphetamine”</B>
<BR><I>Sanford A. Angelos and Jack K. Raney, United States Drug Enforcement
Administration, North Central Laboratory, 610 South Canal Street, Chicago,
IL 60607</I>

<P>Two clandestine amphetamine laboratories produced a number of samples
containing phenylacetic acid and <em>alpha</em>-phenylacetamide. From the chemicals
found at the laboratory site, the most likely procedure should have been
to first manufacture phenyl-2-propanone and further produce amphetamine.
What became suspect from the analysis of the mixture was that the clandestine
laboratory operators had attempted to carry out the synthesis of both phenyl-2-propanone
and amphetamine in the same reaction. The results were that an impurity,
  <em>alpha</em>-phenylacetamide, usually found in small amounts was now the major
product of the reaction. Spectral data of the various samples seized are
presented.

<P><B>“The Use of Chemical lonization-MS in Analyzing Novel Amphetamine
Reaction Mixtures”</B>
<BR><I>Richard R. Laing; Health Canada, Health Protection Branch, 3155
Willingdon Green, Burnaby, BC V5G4P2</I>

<P>In a recent Clandestine lab seizure in Vancouver, B.C. (28/06/93) the
cook stated that he was cooking a “legal” nonscheduled amphetamine analogue.
Since a preliminary examination of some of the seized exhibits was negative,
Chemical lonization-MS was examined using 7 amphetamine-like compounds
to determine its applicability in singling out an amphetamine analogue
from a complex reaction mixture.

<P><B>“Examination of MDA”</B>
<BR><I>V. Sorokin, A. Beljaev, K. Ponkratov; Criminalistics Center Ministry
of Internal Affairs of Russia, 123060, Moscow, Raspletina Street, 22, Moscow
123069</I>

<P>Illegal manufacture of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) has been
organized at pharmaceutical plant in Oljane town (Latvia) in the late 1992.
Isosafrole has been oxidized with formic acid and hydrogen peroxide mixture.
Product of this reaction has been hydrogenized with an ammonia and gaseous
hydrogen mixture in methanol media (pressure 1.5 MPa; catalyst Ni-Rainey
has been used). In result of this reaction MDA has been obtained. Finale
product has been produced as white tablets. Tablet’s weight is about 300
mg. Investigation with employment TLC, GC and IRFT methods after purification
of the probe by means of a solid-phase extraction made it possible to identify
MDA.

<P><B>“Clandestine Drug Lab Chemistry Illustrated”</B>
<BR><I>Jeffrey R. Dovci, Oregon State Police Crime Lab, 650 Royal Avenue
Suite 12, Medford, OR 97504</I>

<P>Clandestine drug chemistry is complex and presents an intellectual challenge
even to the trained forensic chemist. Providing expert testimony on the
subject can prove to be an even greater challenge. To effectively testify
to any scientific principle or conclusion in a court of law, it is often
necessary to assume the role of educator. The expert must adequately instill
a functional level of technical understanding in the minds of the judge
and jury so they may fully comprehend the significance of the expert’s
opinion. If the expert fails in this task, even the most insightful presentation
will fall on deaf ears and its relevance will be lost. As an educator,
the expert must utilize any tool at their disposal. One of the most valuable
tools the expert can use is visual aids. Visual aids can be in a variety
of formats including slides, overheads transparencies, and poster graphics.
The following computer generated and hand painted illustrations are examples
of visual aids which have been used successfully in both the state and
federal courts of California and Oregon. The computer graphics were generated
on a 486/50 MHz personal computer equipped with 8 MB of RAM. The system
includes a 170 MB IDE hard disk and a super VGA non-interlaced monitor
with a BOCA 1 MB video card. The software used was Computer Support Corporation’s
“Arts &amp; Letters” with Windows 3.1. The color illustrations were generated
on a Hewlett - Packard DeskJet 500C inkjet printer.

<P><B>“Mope Dope and AIDS Cures: Central California Drug Lab Scenes, 1992-1993”</B>
<BR><I>Jerry Massetti; California State Department of Justice, Fresno Regional
Laboratory, 6014 North Cedar Avenue, Fresno, CA 93710</I>

<P>Two new distinctive types of clandestine drug laboratories have been
observed in Central California during the last year. The first was a highly
stylized, repetitive organized crime type of operation which used the hydriodic
acid/red phosphorous reduction of ephedrine to methamphetamine. This reaction
has been used in Central California for years; however, some innovative
variations have streamlined the process. One of the scenes corroborated
rumors about multiple tons of ephedrine being processed in this way. The
repetitive aspect of these labs constitute an interesting study in linking
sites of serial crimes with physical evidence. The second kind of lab newly
observed in Central California in the past year produced hypercin from
St. John’s Wort. AIDS cures have occurred in other clandestine drug laboratory
investigations in California.

<P><B>“Clandestine Aminorex, A Designer Drug Parent Finds the East Coast”</B>
<BR><I>Jason W. Freed, BS, and Vincent Cordova, BA; National Medical Services,
Inc., 2300 Stratford Avenue, Willow Grove, PA 19090</I>

<P>In this presentation we describe a case of a fragrance laboratory being
used as a cover for clandestine <I>d,l</I>-aminorex laboratory. The peculiar
twist of this case was that <I>d,l</I>-aminorex is the parent compound
of the more conventionally recovered 4-methylaminorex, a federally controlled
Schedule 1 drug. Additionally, <I>d,l</I>-aminorex was not, at the time,
a common street drug in the Philadelphia or surrounding east coast area.
Work with undercover officers throughout a lengthy investigation enabled
a search and seizure of the laboratory. Findings from street purchases
and samples from the lab identified <I>d,l</I>-aminorex. Precursors identified
from the laboratory consisted of <I>dl</I>-2-aminolphenylethanol, cyanogen
bromide, various solvents, and sodium acetate. These findings led to the
confiscation and dismantling of the laboratory and to the arrest of the
suspect involved in producing the <I>d,l</I>-aminorex.

<P><B>“Disposal Technologies”</B>
<BR><I>Jeffrey L. Buntrock and Robert E. Brown; Chemical Waste Management,
Inc., 4227 Technology Drive, Fremont, CA 94538</I>

<P>In 1976, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, became
law. This was the first effort on the part of the Federal Government to
regulate the management and disposal of hazardous waste, and was comprehensive
and far-reaching in its impact. Since then, RCRA has been amended several
times, with the 1984 Hazardous Solid Waste Amendments, or HSWA, being of
the greatest significance. These amendments to RCRA have, with few exceptions,
eliminated the disposal of hazardous waste directly into landfills without
previous treatment to specific standards. Management and disposal have
been further complicated by State requirements, and the necessary inclusion
of materials previously unregulated by the Federal Government. Finally,
with regards to clandestine drug wastes, regulatory requirements extend
from RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), TSCA (Toxic Substances
Control Act), State Programs, and even some pressures from the NRC (Nuclear
Regulatory Commission) for management of low-level radioactive materials.
This presentation discusses the management and disposal options and opportunities
in the 1990’s. Included is an overview of the waste streams typical of
Clandestine Lab Sites, and the available treatment technologies for each.
Specific discussion will include examples of disposal facilities of each
type, as well as possible alternatives. The presentation endeavors to provide
an overview of hazardous waste management and disposal as it pertains to
Clandestine Drug Lab materials.

<P><B>“Fatalities Resulting From Clandestine Drug Manufacturing Laboratories”</B>
<BR><I>Roger A. Ely, Drug Enforcement Administration, Western Laboratory,
390 Main Street Room 700, San Francisco, CA 94105; and Steven B. Johnson,
Los Angeles Police Department Crime Lab, 555 Ramirez Space #270, Los Angeles,
CA 90012</I>

<P>Clandestine drug laboratories are known to contain extremely hazardous
chemicals which can cause serious injury or death to the lab operator and
to the investigator. Fire and explosion from organic solvents and reactive
materials remain a serious threat. One illicit synthetic method to methamphetamine
using a red phosphorus - hydriodic acid reduction of ephedrine can be especially
dangerous due to the reactants and byproducts formed from their reaction.
Two separate incidents resulting in the deaths of three people in Los Angeles,
CA, and two in Post Falls, ID, will be presented with crime scene reconstructions
and postmortem findings.

<P><B>“Methamphetamine Synthesis Via Reductive Alkylation Hydrogenolysis
of Phenyl-2-Propanone with N-Benzylmethylamine”</B>
<BR><I>Harry F. Skinner; Drug Enforcement Administration, Southwest Laboratory,
410 West 35th Street, National City, CA 91950</I>

<P>Methamphetamine was synthesized by reductive alkylation hydrogenolysis
of phenyl-2-propanone with N-benzylmethylamine. The expected product N-benzylmethamphetamine,
once formed, undergoes hydrogenolysis to methamphetamine and toluene. The
progress of the reaction, the intermediates formed during the reaction,
and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.

<P><B>“Examinations of Duct Tape in Clandestine Labs”</B>
<BR><I>Max Courtney; Forensic Consultant Services, P.0. Box 11668, Fort
Worth, TX 76110</I>

<P>In case after case involving clandestine amphetamine or methamphetamine
laboratories, the violators have been seen to employ duct tape. Common
examples of its use include taping glass joints and sealing of packages
of product or boxes of equipment. Numerous class characteristics and individual
characteristics are discussed in this application of criminalistics to
the drug enforcement area. Duct tape offers a wealth of information in
comparing questioned and known samples for tying a violator to an offense.
<BR>

<P><B>“Cocaine in Bleach: Destroying the Evidence.&nbsp; Identification
of Degradation Products”</B>
<BR><I>Alexis Carpenter and Richard R. Laing, Health Protection Branch,
Drug Analytical Service, Health Canada, 3155 Willingdon Green, Burnaby,
B.C., V5G 4P2</I>

<P>In recent months, this laboratory has received over forty unusual exhibits
from Edmonton, Alberta. These exhibits were found to contain liquid bleach,
some of which had traces of cocaine. The samples were seized during raids
on fortified shooting galleries where buckets containing bleach (typically
one-gallon ice cream containers) were found. It was suspected that the
occupants had dumped quantities of cocaine into the bleach for the purpose
of destroying the evidence. We were able to identify cocaine in some of
the samples, but in many others cocaine was totally absent. Closer inspection
of GC-MS data revealed several compounds present in large quantities and
appeared to be related to cocaine. These compounds were identified as degradation
products with norcocaine and N-formylcocaine being the most predominant.

<P><B>“The Analytical Profiling of Methamphetamine of Various Origins”</B>
<BR><I>Peter Fifka, Jiri Zapletal, and Jaromir Novak, Police Institute
of Criminalistics, 9.Maja 1, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia, 97486</I>

<P>Methamphetamine hydrochloride salt has been prepared by two different
syntheses:</p>

<OL>
<li><span class="oli">The reductive amination from 1-phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The reduction of ephedrine using iodine and red phosphorus</span></li>
</OL>

<p>Prepared samples were examined after previous preconcentration of impurities
by GC-MS analysis. Some compounds were identified among the impurities.
Chromatographic spectra of both are different and by the presence of some
specific impurities, it is possible to determine the way of the synthesis.</p>

<P>

<P><B>“Sodium Bicarbonate Assay in Controlled Substance Exhibits”</B>
<BR><I>Thomas R. Ekis and Max Courtney, Forensic Consultant Services, PO
Box 11668, Fort Worth, TX 76110</I>

<P>Controlled substance samples occasionally are encountered wherein sodium
bicarbonate also is detected, especially in phenethylamines and cocaine.
Synthesis strategies seem to suggest no logical reason for the presence
of bicarbonates in phenethylamines beyond its use as a cutting agent; there
is no apparent way to determine whether its presence in “crack” is as an
intended cutting agent or as a remnant from the preparation of the cocaine
free base. For either legal or investigative reasons, assay of the sodium
bicarbonate is sometimes required. Due to the buffering properties of the
bicarbonate ion, volumetric analysis can be difficult. This presentation
deals with the methodology of titration and the selection of proper endpoint
indicators suitable for titration of bicarbonates.

<P><B>“The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993”</B>
<BR><I>Clyde F. Richardson, Drug Enforcement Administration, Diversion
Control Section, 600 Army-Navy Drive, Arlington, VA, 22202</I>

<P>This presentation will explain the provisions of the federal Domestic
Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 which became effective on April
16, 1994. The new law enhances DEA’s ability to regulate the distribution
of certain chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of controlled substances.
It places more requirements on handlers of these chemicals, provides administrative
authority for regulating drug products containing ingredients used in illicit
manufacturing, and places reporting requirements for manufacturers of regulated
chemicals.

<P><B>“The Ritter Reaction Using Safrole: An Encounter In Two Clandestine
Labs”</B>
<BR><I>Richard R. Laing and Brian Dawson, Health Protection Branch, Drug
Analytical Service, Health Canada, 3155 Willingdon Green, Burnaby, B.C.,
V5G 4P2</I>

<P>In two recent MDA clandestine lab seizures, references were found relating
to the Ritter reaction in which safrole, acetonitrile and concentrated
sulphuric acid are reacted together at cold temperatures. In repeating
the synthesis the desired intermediate N-acetyl MDA was not found at any
stage of the reaction. The major reaction product, although seeming to
relate to MDA was partially characterized using IR spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry but require <SUP>1</SUP>H and <SUP>13</SUP>C NMR techniques
for structure confirmation. The major product 3,4-dihydro-1,3-dimethyl-6,7-methylenedioxyisoquinoline
does not appear to be the desired end product and has also recently been
identified in two street samples from the Vancouver area.

<P><B>“MDA From Safrole by the Ritter Reaction”</B>
<BR><I>R. Kazlauskas and V. Murtaugh, Australian Government Analytical
Laboratory, PO Box 385, Pymble, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2071</I>

<P>The underground book by Uncle Fester, “Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture,”
mentions use of the Ritter reaction to make MDA from safrole, by analogy
to making amphetamine from allybenzene. But when the reaction is applied
to safrole and acetonitrile, it gives only a low yield of the expected
product, N-acetyl MDA. The major product appears to be an isoquinoline.
It is suggested that clandestine lab chemists can use this compound as
an indicator of the Ritter or related reactions.

<P><B>“The Use of Hydrogen Peroxide in Ephedrine Reductions: A Growing
Trend”</B>
<BR><I>Tim McKibben and Troy Ward, Aurora Police Department, 15001 E. Alameda,
Aurora, CO, 80012; and Dawn Sorenson, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Crime
Laboratory, PO Box 569, San Bernardino, CA, 92402-0569</I>

<P>The use of hydrogen peroxide in the reduction of ephedrine to methamphetamine
has become popular in several western states. The use of this reagent introduces
several new possible reaction and byproducts. The use of peroxide should
also be a cause of concern because of its explosive properties. This paper
will introduce the use of hydrogen peroxide, its possible side reactions,
byproducts, and impurities to the forensic chemist.

<P><B>“An Overview of Central California Clandestine Methamphetamine Laboratories
Associated with Mexican Nationals”</B>
<BR><I>Jerry Massetti, CA Department of Justice Regional Laboratory, 1704
East Bullard Avenue, Fresno, CA 93710</I>

<P>Large capacity clandestine methamphetamine laboratories associated with
operatives from Mexico continue to inundate Central California with increasing
frequency. Work crews report to remote, secluded, usually agricultural
sites to discretely deliver, process, and dispose of chemicals and equipment
used to manufacture methamphetamine. Seven and ten ton shipments of ephedrine
have been documented. Some manufacturing incidents have aroused environmental
impact concerns. An overview of recent cases will be presented.


<P><B>“Application of the SplitPea<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> FT-IR
Micro Sampling ATR Apparatus in Analysis of Drugs of Abuse”</B>
<BR><I>Richard R. Laing, Health Protection Branch, Health Canada, 3155
Willingdon Green, Burnaby, BC, Canada V5G 4P2</I>

<P>The SplitPea<SUP>TM</SUP> (Harrick Scientific Corporation, Ossing, NY)
is an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) experiment module consisting of
a purgable condenser optics and an external sampling stage for most FT-IR
Spectrometers (Nicolet Magna 550, Madison, WI). Either ATR or Diffuse Reflectance
(DR) can be selected by simply changing the sample holder. While ATR is
primarily used for surface analysis such as films, fibers, and pastes the
SplitPea<SUP>TM</SUP> in DR mode affords a wider application and has been
applied to routine drug analyses in our laboratory. The external sample
stage allows facile placement of the sample on the contact surface at the
optics focus giving excellent spectra. Powders such as cutting agents or
methamphetamine can easily be run neat without the preparation of KBr disks
in ATR mode. Extracts such as LSD base can be spotted directly on the 350-300
micron Si crystal for ATR or on the traditional AgCl disk in the DR mode.
Films and residues on a variety of surfaces can also be analyzed which
normally using traditional IR techniques would be very difficult.

<P><B>“Estimation of Drug Product Yields from Clandestine Laboratory Synthesis
Routes”</B>
<BR><I>Edwin G. Albers, DEA - South Central Laboratory, 1880 Regal Row,
Dallas, Texas 75235</I>

<P>Forensic chemists are frequently called upon to estimate production
yields in clandestine laboratory cases based upon either the quantities
of starting materials present or the size of the empty reaction vessels.
Theoretical yields may be calculated; however, these do not reflect the
realities occurring in chemical combinations during a synthesis reaction.
Because there is a bewildering array of possible conditions and circumstances
in a laboratory and none of these are specified when an estimate is called
for, assumptions were adopted to impose some order and “typicalness” on
the situation. Reactions were run several times and yields factors were
calculated.

<P><B>“Illness Reports in Clandestine Drug Laboratory Investigators: A
Pilot Study.”</B>
<BR><I>Jeffery L. Burgess, MD, Washington Poison Center, P.O. Box 5371,
CG-09, Seattle, WA 98115</I>

<P>A retrospective cohort study was done in an international group of 46
law enforcement chemists and in 13 state and local clandestine drug laboratory
team members with over 2800 combined responses. Each participant completed
a questionnaire concerning previous drug lab responses and adverse health
effects during response activities. Methamphetamine labs accounted for
81-97% of all responses. Total illness incident rates varied between 0.75-3.4%
of responses. Most exposures were through inhalation, and many occurred
in the years prior to use of full personal protective equipment. Symptoms
were primarily those of headache and respiratory/mucous membrane irritation.
86% of illnesses occurred during processing, which accounted for 87% of
all lab hours. No phase of response activities appeared to carry a higher
risk of illness after adjusting for total hours. A majority of illness
episodes occurred in labs with leak/spills, fire/explosion, or uncontrolled
reactions. Gender and age were not risk factors for becoming ill. Responding
to an active lab carried a 7-15 fold risk of becoming ill as compared with
set-up, in-transit, or former (equipment removed) labs. The sample size
was not large enough to compute risk factors for non-methamphetamine labs
or compare the efficacy of different types of personal protective equipment.

<P><B>“The Sodium-Ammonia 'Nazi' Method of Methamphetamine Synthesis”</B>
<BR><I>Nick Dawson, Arkansas State Crime Lab, #3 Natural Resources Drive,
Little Rock, Arkansas 72215</I>

<P>The Missouri and Arkansas region has seen a new clandestine lab method
appear in the last two years, which utilizes sodium metal, anhydrous ammonia,
and denatured alcohol. Termed the “Nazi” method, because of a World War
II patent using these methods, it poses a significant problem for law enforcement
and lab personnel alike, as it is a very quick, cheap and efficient method,
but one that poses many safety hazards. Originally derived from a metal
reduction process for making methamphetamine found in California in the
late 1980’s there is a good chance that because of its simplicity and quickness
more labs will be seized that have used the “Nazi” method.

<P><B>“Application of the Ionscan for the Detection of Methamphetamine
and Ephedrine in Abandoned Clandestine Laboratories”</B>
<BR><I>Patricia A. Brown and Jeffrey H. Comparin, DEA - Southwestern Laboratory,
410 W. 35th Street, National City, CA 91950</I>

<P>Clandestine methamphetamine laboratories are prevalent in southern California.
The most common encountered synthesis results in vapor release, and drug
residue being left behind. The suspected manufacturing area can be vacuumed
and/or methanol wiped and screened immediately at the lab site using the
Ionscan. Positive results are confirmed by obtaining vacuum sweep samples
with subsequent analysis at the DEA laboratory. This procedure has been
utilized successfully for identifying methamphetamine and ephedrine from
clandestine laboratories that have been abandoned and/or remodeled.

<P><B>“Identification And Quantitation Of Hydriodic Acid Manufactured From
Iodine, Red Phosphorus And Water”</B>
<BR><I>Scott R. Oulton and Harry F. Skinner, DEA - Southwestern Laboratory,
410 W. 35th Street, National City, CA&nbsp; 91950</I>

<P>Laboratory operators typically have chosen the route of synthesis for
hydriodic acid by the reaction of iodine, red phosphorus and water. Other
routes of synthesis includes the use of hypophosphorus and phosphorus acids
coupled with iodine. Due to these manufacturing processes, phosphoric acid
is one of the remaining byproducts. Hydriodic acid prepared commercially
is distilled to remove the phosphoric acid. Clandestine hydriodic acid
is not typically purified or distilled and therefore an appreciable amount
of phosphoric acid is present in the mixture. Commercial and clandestine
HI can be differentiated and positively identified. Quantitation of hydriodic
acid can be estimated utilizing density or accurately quantitated by an
acid/base titration. Acid samples that contain only hydriodic acid are,
in all probability, from a commercial source. Acid samples that contain
a mixture of hydriodic acid and an appreciable amount of phosphoric acid
are of clandestine origin.

<P><B>“Screening Of Illicit Tablets Using The Ionscan”</B>
<BR><I>Patricia A. Brown and Pamela R. Smith, DEA - Southwestern Laboratory,
410 W. 35th Street, National City, CA</I>&nbsp; <I>91950</I>

<P>Recently, the Southwest laboratory has encountered many clandestinely
manufactured tablets, both in the field and as evidence submissions. Many
of these tablets are similar in appearance, or look like one type of tablet,
but contain another substance. These tablets either respond the same to
field test kits, or have no response. In the laboratory they may not have
a screening test other than chromatography. Therefore, a quick screening
method is needed to presumptively identify the tablets. This is done by
wiping the tablet onto the clean filter and then screening on the Ionscan.
This procedure was used to differentiate 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine. The procedure can also be used
to differentiate diazepam, methaqualone, and flurazepam.

<P><B>“Outside Testing Laboratories: Friend or Foe?”</B>
<BR><I>Jason W. Freed, National Medical Services, 2300 Stratford Ave.,
Willow Grove, PA 19090</I>

<P>After clandestine drug laboratories are seized, specimens collected,
and testing complete, it is inevitable that defense attorney intervention
is close behind. Defense attorneys turn to the private sector to miraculously
find the solution to the government’s misinterpretation of their clients
chemistry curiosity. The role of the private laboratory is one of a check
and balance system for the prosecution’s scientific findings. This role
should not always be viewed as a hostile attack. Work can vary from educating
defense attorneys about a controlled substance or manufacturing procedure
to reviewing laboratory testing procedures and results to actual re-analysis
of evidence. This presentation will cover some of the approaches taken
when working with a seized laboratory already processed by a government
crime laboratory. A review of several clandestine laboratories having different
levels of involvement will be discussed.

<P><B>“Review of Clandestine Laboratories in Northern New Zealand”</B>
<BR><I>Rodney J. Norris, Institute of Environmental Science &amp; Research
Ltd. (ESR), Mt. Albert Science Centre, Hampstead Road, Mt. Albert Private
Bag 92-021, Auckland, New Zealand</I>

<P>Several types of interesting clandestine drug laboratories have been
encountered in the northern part of New Zealand in recent years (as well
as the regular occurrence of “hash oil” and “homebake” laboratories). My
laboratory’s involvement will be discussed, and as much information as
possible regarding each type of lab will be reviewed.

<P>Unusual and interesting laboratories have included:</p>

<uL>
<li><span class="oli">MDMA (“Ecstasy”) being manufactured at a will-known alternative community.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Alkyl nitrites being supplied for the “adult” market.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">PCP manufacture.</span></li>
</uL>

<p>In the absence of an operating methamphetamine laboratory being found in
our region, attempts to manufacture methamphetamine will be discussed.
Some interesting literature seized by the police and customs will be illustrated.</p>

<P><B>“Bombs And Booby Traps In Clandestine Labs”</B>
<BR><I>S/A Alexander F. Smith, Jr., Drug Enforcement Administration, Baltimore,
MD</I>

<P>This workshop will present the recognition and awareness of explosive
materials; the component parts required for the construction, placement,
activation, and blast effects of improvised explosive devices; current
“counter-measure” equipment and strategies directed by drug trafficking
individuals and organizations to repel law enforcement operations. Reference
materials are provided and the presentation is complemented by extensive
slide and video aids.

<P><B>“Cocaine Processing”</B>
<BR><I>John Casale, Senior Forensic Chemist, Drug Enforcement Administration,
Special Testing and Research Laboratory, 7704 Old Springhouse Road, McLean,
VA&nbsp; 22102-3494</I>

<P>The predominant methods currently utilized in South America for illicit
production of cocaine are described. These include the production of cocaine
base from cocaine paste from coca leaf via both the solvent and acid extraction
techniques, and conversion of cocaine base to cocaine hydrochloride.

<P><B>“Clandestine Production Of Amphetamine And Its Analogs: The UK Perspective”</B>
<BR><I>Leslie A. King, Ph.D., Forensic Science Service, Aldermaston, Berkshire,
U.K.&nbsp; RG7 4PN</I>

<P>Seizures of amphetamine and various of its derivatives are increasing
at a faster rate than other illicit drugs. Impurity profiling has enabled
the major sources of amphetamine to be identified. Introduction of increasingly
strict precursor controls has forced most production overseas, but around
fifteen clandestine laboratories are found each year. One of the largest
laboratories was raided in 1993; several tons of unused precursors were
recovered. At another site earlier this year, operators were using a 500L
steel vessel for production of phenyl-2-propanone. In the past few years,
many new amphetamine analogs have appeared; most are not controlled by
legislation and some present analytical challenges.

<P><B>“Clandestine Laboratories And Chemical Seizures In The United States
and Worldwide”</B>
<BR><I>Debbie Wegman, Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion
Control, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, 600 Army-Navy Drive, Washington
D.C.&nbsp; 20532-0001</I>

<P>The United States is a party to the United Nations Convention against
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (1988
Convention).&nbsp;&nbsp; As a party to the 1988 Convention, the United
States must submit specific chemical information to the United Nations
on an annual basis: quantities seized, seizures by country of origin, methods
of diversion and illicit manufacture, licit and illicit use, and importation/exportation.
The United States submissions as well as other countries submissions will
be discussed.

<P><B>“Kodak Film Developing Chemicals And Clandestine Methamphetamine
Laboratories: An Apparent Motive for Homicide”</B>
<BR><I>Katherine S. Wilcox, Oregon State Police Forensic Laboratory, 333
4th Avenue, Coos Bay, OR&nbsp; 97420</I>

<P>On two previous field investigations of clandestine methamphetamine
laboratories, bottles of Kodak developing solution have been found among
the chemicals. In this case presentation, two boxes of miscellaneous photographic
chemicals were the apparent motive for two “cranksters” to murder their
associate. The murderers thought the photographic chemicals (which were
worthless junk) to be worth $250,000 to $300,000 if they could just find
a cook to extract the precursor chemicals. When they thought their associate
was holding out on them, he was murdered, and burned up in his new car.
The myth that essential precursors can be extracted from photographic chemicals
will be explored.

Antwerpen, Belgium”</B>
<BR><I>V.Arescchka, C. van Haeren, H, Coppens, B. Viaene, and V. Eckelmans;
National Instituut voor Criminalistiek en Criminologie, Brussels, Belgium</I>

<P>Twelve suspicious metal containers (each approx. 33 m<SUP>3</SUP>) were
found in the port of Antwerpen, Belgium. When opened, they appeared to
contain all the necessary equipment for a large scale clandestine laboratory.
The confiscated equipment indicated a high degree of sophistication by
its operators.

<P>Among the items seized were the following:</p>

<UL>
<li><span class="oli">an electrical generator (400Kw capacity)</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">water recycling equipment</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">two high speed tablet presses (Unipress) with a capacity of 100,000 tablets/hour</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">twenty boxes of tablet molds (one with a dove symbol)</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">heat exchangers</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">water cooling systems</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">reactor for drug synthesis with several cubic meter capacity</span></li>
</UL>

<p>No large supply of chemicals was ever found. Only one tablet with the dove
logo was found. Chemical analysis with the aid of Gas Chromatography coupled
to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques revealed the presence of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine
(MDMA or XTC). This compound was also identified in the powder discovered
in and around the tablet presses and on some of the apparatus. Traces of
precursor material (e.g. isosafrole) and of chemical intermediates (e.g.,
N-formyl-MDMA) typical for the Leuckart synthesis were also detected.</p>

‘HEMP BC’: Examination of THC Purity and Chemical Profiles”</B>
<BR><I>Richard R. Laing, Health Canada, Health Protection Branch, 3155
Willingdon Green, Burnaby, BC V5G4P2</I>

<P>In Vancouver, BC there is a strong movement to decriminalize Hemp (Cannabis
sativa). Most activists claim that hemp should have a legitimate place
in society and the Hemp BC retail store sells everything from hemp clothing,
hemp flour, foodstuffs, and cannabis seed. In January, 1996, Vancouver
City Police raided the storefront and seized numerous quantities of cannabis
seeds. Most of these seeds were packaged in small numbers and had names
such as “Primo Cut”, “Mighty Mite”, and “Thick Gulf Indica” Prices ranged
from $1.50 to $4.00 a seed. Under the Narcotic Control Act, non-viable
cannabis seeds is permitted in bird food while viable seed is illegal.
Various types of cannabis seeds were grown under identical conditions in
order to determine if the cot per seed reflected the THC concentration.
This poster presents this data along with sample matching data of similar
seeds and examines chemical profiling based upon sex and effects of female
plants going to seed.

<BR><I>Jerry Massetti, California State Department of Justice, Fresno Regional
Laboratory, 6014 North Cedar Avenue, Fresno, CA 93710</I>

<P>On August 19, 1995, <I>d,l</I>-amphetamine began showing up in suspected
methamphetamine samples submitted to CA DOJ crime laboratories. Amphetamine
had been a rarity since the mid-1980’s. Despite this, within a few weeks
of its first appearance, <I>d,l</I>-amphetamine and <I>d</I>-methamphetamine
mixtures were detected in suspected methamphetamine samples by crime laboratories
in at least six Western US states. Midwest and Eastern US labs reported
it by late November.
<BR>&nbsp; At the same time as amphetamine appeared, the amount of active
phenethylamine ingredient dropped dramatically. Very large amounts of caffeine
and nicotinamide were used as diluents. An increasing number of samples
were also found to be diluted with dimethylsulfone. Changes in the physical
appearance of samples corresponding to chemical changes were also noticed.
<BR>&nbsp; <I>d,l</I>-Phenylpropanolamine has been substituted for single
isomer ephedrine or pseudoephedrine in large scale clandestine laboratories
using the hydriodic acid and red phosphorus reduction. Phenylpropanolamine
is being extracted from commercially available tablets such as “AcceleRx
Appetite Suppressant” (M.A. Products, Pinellas Park, FL). Secondary medicinal
compounds like triprolidine and chlorpheniramine carry over into the final
clandestinely manufactured products.
<BR>&nbsp; <I>d,l</I>-Amphetamine continues to persist in suspected methamphetamine
samples one full year after it first emerged. Amphetamine was present in
14% of approximately 3,000 California State Department of Justice (CA DOJ)
drug cases in which either amphetamine or methamphetamine were identified
during the first six months of 1996. This figure varied from 8% to 30%
amphetamine in suspected methamphetamine samples when data was considered
individually from each of the 10 CA DOJ laboratories that perform dosage
drug analyses.




<P><B>"Trace Drug Evidence Collection Techniques"</B>
<BR><I>William M. Moriwaki</I>, <I>DEA – Western Lab</I>, <I>San Francisco,
California, USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; Ever since the O.J. Simpson trial unfolded, trace evidence collection
and preservation has been closely scrutinized by the courts. The possible
contamination and integrity of the evidence are the usual concerns.&nbsp;
However, collecting trace drug evidence can present additional challenges.
At the Drug Enforcement Administration's Western Laboratory in San Francisco,
we have successfully used two different procedures to collect trace amounts
of drugs. One is based on the classic vacuum sweeping technique and the
other is a solvent swabbing technique.
<BR>&nbsp; The vacuum sweep is a classic technique used to collect trace
physical evidence such as hairs, fibers, and drugs. Unfortunately, cross
contamination is possible when collecting trace evidence with a vacuum.
The nozzle head and filter housing must be thoroughly cleaned between each
collection. Using clean pre-packaged disposable vacuum filter nozzles solves
the issue of sample contamination. These filters also increase efficiency
because "blanks" no longer need to be collected between different samples.
<BR>&nbsp; An alcohol wipe is the second technique we successfully use
to collect drug residues at crime scenes and from drug suspects. Carrying
methanol for swabbing can be problematic:&nbsp; bottles can break or leak.
Federal law restricts carrying quantities of flammable liquids on airline
flights. Contamination of the alcohol may be an issue, thus requiring "blanks"
to be taken before each swabbing. A solution to the logistic problems of
this technique is to use commercially prepared, pre-packaged, and pre-moistened
alcohol towelettes. These towelettes offer a clean, compact, and contamination-free
way to collect drug residues. These towelettes are an inexpensive and viable
alternative to carrying solvents to a crime scene.
<BR>&nbsp; To help identify areas where trace amounts of drugs may be present,
an instrument known as the Ion Scan has been successfully used. The advantages
and disadvantages will be discussed.

<P><B>"Clandestine Phenethylamine Laboratory Syntheses and Analytical Training"</B>
<BR><I>Roger A. Ely</I>, <I>DEA – Western Laboratory</I>, <I>San Francisco,
CA, USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; Regardless of their experience in examining suspected controlled
substances, newly hired forensic chemists with the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's (DEA) laboratories must successfully complete a rigorous
analytical training program before they are allowed to examine case samples.
Since the types of cases and work load vary with each DEA laboratory, each
laboratory's training program is developed and tailored to suit their needs.
<BR>&nbsp; The DEA Western Laboratory, San Francisco, training introduces
the controlled and restricted drug groups including color screening tests,
extractions, identification and quantitative analyses procedures, and mock
court sessions. The program also familiarizes the trainee with the uses
and limitations of analytical instrumentation in the Western Laboratory.
Though one or two "senior" chemists lead the training, other staff chemists
assist by providing specialized training in analytical and/or instrumental
methodology for particular drugs.
<BR>&nbsp; Over the past 5 years, the author has developed and refined
the clandestine phenethylamine laboratory investigation and analyses portion
of the Western Laboratory's training program. This section gives the new
chemist the basic knowledge, skills, and techniques necessary to investigate,
analyze, and testify about clandestine phenethylamine laboratories seized
in the Western Laboratory's 11-state service area. The training utilizes
classroom lecture, hands-on syntheses and sampling, hands-on analytical
methodology, a written examination and an oral presentation of analytical
findings.
<BR>&nbsp; This presentation details the clandestine phenethylamine training
designed by the author. The author will provide a critical assessment of
the success of the training to date and offer suggestions for developing
similar training programs for individual laboratories.

<P><B>"Separation and Identification of Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine Mixtures"</B>
<BR><I>Scott Oulton, DEA – Southwestern Laboratory, National City, CA.
USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; Clandestine methamphetamine laboratories are prevalent in the
United States, especially in southern California. The synthesis route of
choice is the reduction of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with hydriodic
acid and red phosphorus. Due to their availability, combinations of these
two precursors are common at laboratory sites. Since ephedrine and pseudoephedrine
are diastereoisomers, the chromatographic and physical separations of these
two isomers are difficult.
<BR>&nbsp; Trace mixtures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can be extremely
difficult to analyze utilizing common underivatized chromatographic techniques.
Separation and detection of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine mixtures can
be accomplished with a gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-50+ (cross-linked
50% phenyl methyl siloxane) column. This mid-polarity phase column effectively
separates ephedrine and pseudoephedrine mixtures without having to utilize
derivatization techniques. Identification can be performed utilizing a
gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-50+ column and an infrared detector.
<BR>&nbsp; With sufficient sample size, separation and isolation of ephedrine
and pseudoephedrine can be accomplished by simple dry extraction techniques.
Identification of these compound mixtures can be performed utilizing infrared
spectrophotometry.

<P><B>"Possible False Identification of MDEA and Tracing Back Synthetic
Pathways in a Clandestine Laboratory"</B>
<BR><I>C. van Haeren, V. Areschka and H, Coppens</I>, <I>National Institute
of Forensic Science</I>, <I>Brussels, Belgium</I>

<P>&nbsp; Twelve suspicious, metal containers were discovered in the Port
of Antwerpen, Belgium. They contained all the necessary equipment for a
clandestine laboratory.
<BR>&nbsp; From the GC-MS analysis of the material, found in and around
the equipment, it was clear that XTC was produced. Interpretation of the
chromatograms and the mass spectrum data revealed that the main peak corresponded
to 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA). A smaller peak was identified
as 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. A second small peak appeared to be 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine
(MDEA).
<BR>&nbsp; Further examination of the findings, however, suggests that
the second small peak corresponds to N,N-dimethyl-MDA instead of MDEA.
This fact could not be proven directly because commercial standards for
N,N-dimethyl-MDA and MDEA are not available.
<BR>&nbsp; The following indirect arguments were considered:

<OL>
<li><span class="oli">The unidentified peak is symmetrical, whereas the peak corresponding
to MDEA gives a slightly more tailing profile due to the NH group in this molecule.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">The mass spectrum of the unknown substance and MDEA are identical, except
for the signal at <I>m/z</I>= 96, which is smaller in the case of MDEA.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">TFAA derivatization of the found material yields MDMA-TFA and MDA-TFA,
while no MDEA-TFA can be detected. This appears to confirm the absence
of a NH group in the compound.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">When MDEA, extracted from known MDEA tablets, was added to the found
material; the resultant chromatogram showed that MDEA eluted at a different time than the unidentified peak.</span></li>
</OL>

<p>&nbsp; These arguments make it highly probable that N,N-dimethyl-MDA was
present in the found material. This conclusion is important, because the
correct identification of the by-products of the synthesis of MDMA can
help to elucidate the pathways followed in the clandestine production.
The presence of N,N-dimethyl-MDA and MDA in trace amounts indicates that
the MDMA was produced by the methylation of MDA and not from the hydrolization
of N-formyl-MDMA.</p>

<P><B>"Three Fatalities Involving Phosphine Gas, Produced as a Result of
Methamphetamine Manufacturing"</B>
<BR><I>Lynn J. Willers-Russo, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,
Scientific Services Bureau, Los Angeles, CA, USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; This paper presents a case involving the death of three individuals
suspected to have been overcome by phosphine gas. Phosphine is a toxic
gas which can be generated during the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The objectives of this paper are to discuss:</p>

<OL>
<li><span class="oli">The chemical mechanisms behind the generation of phosphine gas as they relate to the manufacturing of methamphetamine;</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The toxicity of phosphine gas and the symptomology due to inhalation;</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Possible phosphine exposure in the field by criminalists and law enforcement personnel who respond to clandestine laboratories.</span></li>
</OL>

<p>&nbsp; In August of 1996, three deceased individuals were discovered in
a small motel room in Los Angeles County. Responding deputies who assessed
the scene noted chemicals and glassware consistent with the clandestine
manufacture of methamphetamine. A possible by-product of the ephedrine
/ hydriodic acid / red phosphorus manufacturing method is phosphine gas.
This gas is extremely poisonous and can be generated when the reaction
mixture is overheated. As no visible signs of injury were apparent on the
victims, phosphine poisoning was suspected by responding Clandestine Laboratory
Task Force personnel. Drager tubes were used to test for the presence of
phosphine gas, which was detected at levels in excess of 1.0 ppm. The Threshold
Limit Value is 0.3 ppm. There was concern regarding the exposure of deputies
who had initially assessed the scene with no protective equipment to this
potentially lethal gas.
<BR>&nbsp; Clandestine laboratories are routinely encountered in Los Angeles
County and frequently involve crude conditions and poor ventilation. The
August 1996 incident raised several concerns and questions regarding lethal
exposure, symptomology, general toxicity and the chemistry of phosphine
gas. Initial review of the standard available reference material revealed
little information. In an attempt to adequately address these new concerns,
a more extensive review of scientific literature was conducted, and persons
with specific knowledge or experience with phosphine gas, were contacted.
<BR>&nbsp; Phosphine (hydrogen phosphide) is a toxic, colorless gas, which
can be produced by a variety of chemical reactions. Generally, phosphine
is seen in the farming industry where it is used as a grain fumigant. It
has long been known that phosphine can also be generated during the manufacturing
of methamphetamine, using ephedrine, hydriodic acid and red phosphorus.
Although some information about phosphine chemistry is available, there
are no direct references to the generation of phosphine as a by-product,
during the manufacturing of methamphetamine. Some references however, were
noted involving a reaction with phosphorus acid, whose chemical mechanism
seems likely, given the type of clandestine labs that we frequently encounter.
<BR>&nbsp; Most of the scientific literature regarding phosphine exposure
deals with the inhalation of the gas by grain fumigators. The symptomology
is well documented. The more common symptoms include those involving the
lungs and respiratory tract. Bronchitis and irritation of the lungs, dyspnea
and pulmonary edema are frequently seen. Other common symptoms include
headache, fatigue, dizziness, pain or pressure in the chest, nausea and
vomiting. The primary result at autopsy is generally pulmonary edema, and
this case was no exception. Some studies indicate a correlation between
phosphine exposure and the inhibition of electron transport, due to the
phosphine interaction with cytochrome oxidase. Research has also associated
phosphine with possible chromosomal damage and with Heinz body formation
in red blood cells.
<BR>&nbsp; With respect to possible phosphine exposure from clandestine
laboratories it is unknown to what extent, if any, responding personnel
are exposed, as no testing for the gas is routinely performed. As a result
of this deadly incident, a Drager pump and tubes for phosphine (as well
as a phosphine-specific gas mask) were purchased and utilized in the field,
when the presence of phosphine might be likely. The results were surprising
in that phosphine was encountered more often than originally suspected.
Once the odor was recognized, the number of incidents where it was detected
increased, more likely due to the increased awareness than by an increase
in the actual number of occurrences. Some of the criminalists noted that
they had previously encountered the odor before, both in the field and
in laboratory submissions. The review of this material has led to a better
understanding of phosphine, and has allowed us to educate our criminalists
and other field personnel, to the possible hazards of accidental exposure.

<P><B>"Determinations of Cations in Seized Clandestine Laboratory Samples
by Capillary Electrophoresis"</B>
<BR><I>Victor A. Bravenec, DEA – South Central Laboratory, Dallas, TX,
USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; Many synthesis routes use inorganic components to manufacture
illicit drugs. The analysis of these inorganic components in clandestine
laboratory samples can prove to be valuable information in determining
the synthesis route used. Capillary Ion Electrophoresis (CIE) was chosen
for the analysis of the cations as it provides good selectivity, short
analysis time, smaller amount of sample (4-7hl), little sample preparation,
and equal or lower detection limits (5 to 30 ppb) when compared to ion
chromatography or atomic absorption spectrometry. Capillary Ion Electrophoresis
is a capillary electrophoresis technique optimized for the rapid determination
of low molecular weight inorganic and organic ions. These small ions lack
a chromophore so Indirect Photometric Detection (IPD) is employed to obtain
detection of these analytes. The following cations are characterized: aluminum,
chromium, sodium, lithium, magnesium, ammonium, barium, zinc, lead, calcium,
copper, nickel, strontium, potassium, mercury, and thorium. Analysis of
illicit samples of popular synthetic routes will be presented as well as
detection of various cations on clandestine glassware and other containers.

<BR><I>Nathan Salazar, DEA – Southwestern Laboratory, San Diego, CA, USA</I>

<P>&nbsp; Anion analysis of hydriodic acid (HI) was conducted using capillary
electrophoresis (CE) with indirect photometric detection. Analysis were
carried out using a fused silica 70cm (61.5cm effective length) x 75m I.D.
capillary at 25&deg;C, with 30kV applied potential. The background electrolyte
consisted of 2.25mM pyromelletic acid as the visualizing agent, and 0.75mM
hexamethonium hydroxide as an electroosmotic flow modifier. The background
electrolyte was buffered at pH 7.7 with sodium hydroxide and triethanolamine.
Separation of iodide from other anions was achieved by addition of 10%
methanol to the background electrolyte. Quantitation of iodide was conducted
to determine the percent HI in solution with an observed linear dynamic
range from 15 to 120 ppm. Clandestinely prepared HI made by reacting iodine
with phosphorus in water was compared to commercially prepared HI. Detection
of phosphate anion was observed for the clandestinely prepared HI, whereas
commercially prepared HI displayed no detection of phosphate anion.</p>

<P>&nbsp; One of the challenges for the forensic chemist is characterizing
seized clandestine laboratory samples and applying a suitable extraction
scheme for isolating controlled substances, precursors, reagents, and/or
solvents. In this workshop, the author has classified various types of
clandestine lab samples and created a flow chart to guide the examining
chemist in selecting a suitable extraction method. This workshop will cover
the examination of one- and two-phase liquids miscible and immiscible with
water, liquid samples containing solids, solid organics and inorganics,
residues, and specialized samples such as vacuum pump oils. This workshop
will discuss each of the presented extraction methodologies, and provide
tips on performing the extractions. Other topics to be discussed include
the quantitative analysis of methamphetamine and amphetamine by GC-FID,
the identification of the optical isomers of the phenylisopropylamines
by derivatization using GC-FID, and some tips for improving phenethylamine

<P><B>“Court Room Presentations”</B>
<BR><I>Roger A. Ely, DEA – Western Laboratory, San Francisco, CA, USA</I></p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultimate test of the forensic drug chemist’s expertise
is in the arena of the court. Testimony regarding clandestine laboratory
evidence, processes, and reconstructions are very different from the typical
controlled substance identification testimony. The success or failure of
a forensic chemist’s testimony regarding a clandestine laboratory is directly
related to the witness’s training, preparation, experience and breadth
of knowledge. The presentation of often seemingly complex and technical
concepts in a manner that a jury or court can understand is a challenge;
yet, adequate preparation and rehearsal allow the witness to easily convey
complicated information in a simple manner. The use of court displays cannot
be understated. This workshop will provide some suggestions and salient
points to consider for the clandestine laboratory expert witness.</p>

<P>&nbsp; The raid on a clandestine laboratory in Park Hills, Missouri,
resulted in the recovery of a number of full and empty pseudoephedrine
tablet boxes and bottles. These were inventoried, photographed, and released
to the hazardous material disposal unit.
<BR>&nbsp; The DEA agents and the local police department put questions
to the laboratory as to how much methamphetamine could have been produced.
Calculations were conducted on how much pseudoephedrine was present and
how much methamphetamine could have been produced if the reaction resulted
in 100% conversion. Since the sodium/ammonia reduction reaction was reported
at the time to result in 90% conversion, a yield projection at this level
was provided. The prosecution decided to utilize these projections in their
court case. The use of these calculations were challenged and a Frye vs.
Daubert hearing was conducted prior to the criminal trial.</p>

<P><B>“Production Capacity Reports”</B>
<BR><I>Gerald Skrowonski, DEA – North Central Laboratory, Chicago, IL, USA</I></p>
<P>&nbsp; A forensic chemist may not only have to analyze evidentiary samples
from a clandestine laboratory, but may also be called upon by prosecutors
to prepare a “Production Capacity Report.” The purpose of this presentation
is to present several ideas on how to prepare these reports.
<BR>
&nbsp; The “total amount“ of controlled substance is typically calculated
from the samples analyzed in the case. In addition, forensic chemists are
required to determine how much more could be made from chemical supplies
present at the clandestine laboratory. Historically, the production capability
has always been calculated as the amount of controlled substance that could
be manufactured at the 100% theoretical yield. This approach has been affirmed
by two court decisions [<strong>1,2</strong>].</p>

<p>&nbsp; The data that the forensic, chemist needs to perform these calculations may be based on:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="oli"><strong>Primary Precursors</strong>	
  <ul>
	<li><span class="oli"><em><strong>Tablets</strong></em>		
	  <ul>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Listed Strength</em></span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Actual analysis</em></span></li>
		</ul></span></li>
	<li><span class="oli"><em><strong>Liquids</strong></em>		
	  <ul>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Instrumental techniques (GC, LC, etc.)</em></span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Gravimetric</em></span></li>
		</ul></span></li>
	<li><span class="oli"><em><strong>Powders</strong></em>		
	  <ul>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Net weight</em></span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Actual analysis</em></span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><em>Residue on filter paper</em></span></li>
		</ul></span></li>	
	</ul></span></li>
<li><span class="oli"><strong>Important Reagents</strong></span></li>
</ul>

<P>&nbsp; When one has a recipe or notes listing the amount of the reagent
used for a particular size synthesis batch, the values listed may be used.&nbsp;
Occasionally, records (handwritten notes, computer data, etc.) are found
at clandestine lab sites indicating past drug production. The total amount
of drug made can be evaluated from this information and, if pertinent,

<P>&nbsp; Protecting group chemistry involves the use of reagents to convert
a functional group into a “protected” functional group, which can then
be subjected to reaction conditions, which would otherwise destroy the
unprotected form. This technique is commonly used throughout organic chemistry,
especially in the pharmaceutical industry. This presentation will introduce
the forensic chemist to some common protection groups and techniques used
to add and remove them from the chemical intermediate. These “protected“
intermediates or precursors have been encountered by forensic chemists
and should be familiar to chemists investigating illicit drug manufacturing
cases. Examples of protection group chemistry used in illicit and legal

<H2>“Cook” Fails Chem 101; Hydrogen Sulfide Fatality</H2>
<p><strong>Mehul B. Anjaria</strong>, Criminalist,<strong><br>
  Hiram K. Evans</strong>, Supervising Criminalist/Deputy Sheriff <br>
<em>San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, Scientific Investigations Division,
<br>
200 S Lena Rd, San Bernardino, CA 92408-1604</em></p>

<H3>Abstract</H3>
<p>&nbsp; A methamphetamine “cook” equipped with an APR apparently mistakenly
attempted to salt out his finished product with hydrogen sulfide rather
than hydrogen chloride, leading to his demise.

<H3>Text</H3>
<p>&nbsp; On January 30, 1997, Criminalists Mehul B. Anjaria and Blaine M.
Kern responded to a suspected clandestine drug laboratory in the Muscoy
area of San Bernardino, CA. On arrival, they were directed by Sheriff's
Narcotics Detectives to the body of a deceased Hispanic male in his late
twenties, lying supine on the driveway adjacent to what had been the garage,
located to the rear of the residence. Near the body of the deceased was
a half-face air purifying respirator (APR) equipped with organic vapor
cartridges. The garage, converted to living quarters, had been previously
entered by a Sheriff's Sergeant wearing self-contained breathing apparatus
(SCBA) only long enough to ascertain that no other victims/suspects were
present and to note a gas cylinder, the open valve on which he was unable
to close.

<P>&nbsp; Criminalists Anjaria and Kern donned protective clothing and
SCBAs and entered the converted garage, noting a gas cylinder labeled “hydrogen
sulfide” with ice formed on the bottom potion of the cylinder, indicating
that the cylinder was freely discharging. The cylinder was connected via
tubing to a 5 gallon bucket containing liquid, consistent with the final
step of methamphetamine manufacture in which the drug is salted out using
hydrogen chloride gas. Also present in the building were two-phase liquids,
red phosphorus, hydriodic acid, lye, a mop bucket equipped with a press,
and other items commonly associated with the clandestine manufacture of
methamphetamine. Due to the hazardous nature of the environment, additional
air cylinder for the SCBAs were requested.

<P>&nbsp; After conferral between the various law enforcement, fire department
and Coroner's representatives, it was decided to move the body of the deceased
upwind from his original position to facilitate the examination of the
body.

<P>&nbsp; Criminalists Anjaria and Kern processed the interior of the garage.
Supervising Criminalist Hiram Evans and Forensic Specialist Karen Rice
assisted the Deputy Coroner with an examination of the body of the deceased,
including rolling set of inked fingerprints and recovery of his wallet.
The wallet contained some peso notes and a California Driver's License
(CDL), although the CDL photograph did not particularly resemble the victim.
Forensic Specialist Rice also assisted in photographing the exterior of
the scene.

<P>&nbsp; The inked fingerprints of the deceased were submitted to the
Lab's Cal-ID unit and subsequently identified as those of a Mexican National,
but not the name given on the CDL.

<P>&nbsp; Hydrogen sulfide (H<SUB>2</SUB>S) is a colorless, heavier than
air, flammable gas having the characteristic, pungent odor of rotten eggs.
Vapor concentrations as low as 50 ppm in air cause toxic symptoms, 300
ppm is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH), and 1000-2000 ppm
is usually fatal within minutes [<strong>1</strong>]. By the way of comparison, hydrogen
cyanide (HCN) is also a colorless, flammable gas, having a characteristic
faint odor, but in contrast is lighter than air, with a 50 ppm IDLH level.
Fatal H<SUB>2</SUB>S poisoning may occur even more rapidly than following
an exposure to similar concentrations of HCN as hydrogen sulfide does not
combine with hemoglobin, but kills through respiratory paralysis [<strong>2</strong>].

<P>&nbsp; Acid gas, organic vapor, and base cartridges generally utilized
in APRs are marked to be used with hydrogen sulfide “for escape only.”
While the odor of hydrogen sulfide is detectable at very low concentrations,
it is an insidious irritant and chemical asphyxiant which fatigues the
sense of smell. With the sense of smell fatigued, those exposed fail to
get warning of high concentrations, leading to respiratory paralysis and
sudden collapse [<strong>3</strong>].

<P>&nbsp; Hydrogen sulfide has been used by Mexican National methamphetamine
“cooks” for the clandestine manufacture of hydriodic acid and its is likely
the deceased obtained it mistakenly for hydrogen chloride gas. Whether
the “cook” obtained it on his own or through others is unknown at this
time.

<H2>Hypophosphorous Acid Use Increases at California<BR>
Clandestine Methamphetamine Labs</H2>

<p><strong>Jerry Massetti</strong>, Criminalist
<br>
<em>CA DOJ Crime Lab, 1704 E. Bullard, Fresno, CA&nbsp; 93710-5856</em></p>


<P>&nbsp; With increasing frequency, California crime lab personnel who
process clandestine lab scenes are recognizing hypophosphorous acid, H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P,
as a reaction ingredient at clandestine methamphetamine laboratory scenes.
In August 1996, a Kern County criminalist reported H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
was being used to reduce ephedrine at a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory
scene in that county [<strong>1</strong>]. Since then it has become apparent that H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
is being used in most parts of California.

<P>&nbsp; The great majority of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P usage has been
almost exclusively at "tweeker" league meth labs where gram-to-ounce size
quantities of product are made at a time. Small disposable glassware, such
as a canning jar or a beer bottle, is employed to contain the ingredients.
No red phosphorous is used. The acid is simply poured onto the starting
material and iodine crystals. Reportedly, as little as fifteen minutes
of heat has been applied. Efficiency of the reaction procedure is unclear
and has not been established from field observations.

<P>&nbsp; One chemist reported that a 12 liter round bottom flask contained
a reaction mixture which utilized H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P. This large
scale reaction using H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P is unusual. H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
has not been reported to be used as a reactant at large scale (multiple
22 L reaction vessel) methamphetamine laboratories whose investigations
commonly associate operatives from Mexico. It has been observed to be used
as a stabilizer for hydriodic acid that is clandestinely produced on a
large scale by Mexican National operations. In those particular instances
approximately 25 ml was added to 5 gallons of hydriodic acid (~52-57%,
w/w).

<P>&nbsp; Chemical cash sales reported to the California Bureau of Narcotics
Enforcement / Clandestine Lab Enforcement Program (BNE / CLEP) corroborate
lab scene observations. Cash sales of chemicals in California exceeding
one hundred dollars are required to be reported to BNE/CLEP. In about a
two year period ending December 1996, the amount of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
reported to this program has more than tripled from $18,844 to $60,383.
One half liter of 50% H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P can be obtained for as
little as $14.10.

<P>&nbsp; One chemical supply house in Southern California is reported
to have sold H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P in containers bearing "Plating
Solution" labels. In January 1992, Johnson reported containers of "Plating
Solution" to contain a mixture of acids consisting mostly of hydriodic
acid [<strong>2</strong>].

<P>&nbsp; Subsequent to Kern County’s report of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P’s
use as a reactant last August, an informal poll of many crime labs in California
was made. Most chemists / criminalists have not encountered or recognized
H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P at a methamphetamine lab investigation. A number
of chemists have stated that they actually have observed H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
at meth lab scenes, but did not consider it as a reaction ingredient and
did not sample it at the time. Others have indicated that they were not
aware of its usefulness for manufacturing methamphetamine. Others indicate
that it would not be identified in their analytical procedures. Another
reported that an unlabeled acidic solution containing phosphorus was retrieved
from a scene, but was not characterized further. A 1-gallon sized bottle
of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P was found at a clandestine methamphetamine
lab fire scene.

<P>&nbsp; Methamphetamine lab scenes using H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P
have been very common in Australia for a number of years. In 1995, Vallely
described its use as a reactant [<strong>3</strong>]. Skinner discussed the reducing capacity
of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P at the 3rd Annual CLIC Seminar at Memphis
(1993). Skinner and Oulton presented an analytical technique for the identification
of H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>P at the 5th Annual CLIC Seminar at Colorado
Springs (1995).
