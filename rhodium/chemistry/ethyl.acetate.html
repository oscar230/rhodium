        <p>This procedure could/should probably be scaled up...</p>
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>Ethyl ethanoate may also be prepared on a larger scale as follows. 
          Add about 10ml of concentrated sulphuric acid to an equal volume of 
          ethanol in a distillation flask (heat is evolved), together with a few 
          pieces of porous pot to ensure smooth boiling later. Connect a condenser 
          and a dropping funnel to the flask as shown in the diagram below and 
          placein the dropping funnel 20ml of ethanol with an equal volume of 
          ethanoic acid. Heat the oil bath to about 150°C and slowly add the ethanol-acid 
          mixture. Ethyl ethanoate distills over. It will contain ethanol and 
          ethanoic acid as impurities and these can be removed by shaking the 
          distillate with sodium carbonate solution to remove the ethanoic acid 
          and calcium chloride solution to remove the ethanol. The ethyl ethanoate 
          can then be dried over fused calcium chloride and obtained pure by distillation.</p>

        <p align="left">Mix 50ml (40g) EtOH and 50ml (52g) GAA thoroughly in a 
          250ml rbf and add slowly with cooling and shaking, 10ml (18.5g) of concentrated 
          sulphuric acid. Ensure that the liquid is homogenous, then fit the flask 
          with a reflux condenser and boil gently for 10min.<br>
          Now distil off about 2/3 of the mixture and then transfer the distillate 
          to a separation funnel. Add about 25ml of 30% NaCO3 solution, cork the 
          funnel and shake carefully in order to neutralise and remove the free 
          acetic and sulphurous acids present in the crude ethyl acetate: much 
          CO2 is evolved during the shaking, therefore release the pressure in 
          the funnel at frequent intervals. Allow the two layers to separate, 
          and carefully run off and reject the lower aqueous layer, ensuring that 
          the NaCO3 solution is removed as completely as possible. Then prepare 
          a solution of 25g anhydrous CaCl2 in 25ml water, add it to the ethyl 
          acetate in the funnel and again shake vigorously. The CaCl2 solution 
          removes any EtOH still present. Allow the mixture to separate and again 
          remove the lower aqeous layer as completely as possible. Then run the 
          ethyl acetate into a small conical flask, add a few lumps of granular 
          CaCl2 and shake occasionally.<br>
          After about 20min when the liquid should be dry, filter it through a 
          small fluted filter paper into a 100ml distillation flask attached to 
          a condenser. Add some boiling chips and distill. Some ether is always 
          formed as a byproduct and is carefully (i.e. slowly) distilled off as 
          a preliminary and separate fraction boiling at 35-40°C.<br>
          Collect the portion of the distillate boiling at 74-79°C, rejecting a 
          small fraction boiling immediately below this range. Yield 50g.<br>
          Ethyl acetate is a colourless liquid with b.p. 77°C and density 0.92g/ml 
          and a pleasant apple-like odour, and is only slightly soluble in water.</p>
