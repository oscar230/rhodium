<b>Extraction Technique: Straight to Bee--The New
Cure<br><br>

A Universal Pill Extraction Technique</b>

</p>


<p>
<b>- Purpose -</b>
</p>

<p>

SWIVE has only been doing free base reactions so his goal
was to create a fast, clean method for producing psuedo free
base from an ever changing array of pills.   He
believes this technique will accomplish just
that.   No pre washing, no soaking, no red
removal.   It's not a water less A/B in fact, it's
just the B and thats why he calls it "Straight to Bee".  It
is totally OTC and uses activated carbon as a cleaning aide
while exploiting the lazy characteristics of VM&P
naptha.   This method was written to be easily
scalable.  Average yield is 60% of very clean free base.

</p>

<p>

<b>- Definitions -</b>

</p>

<p>

In this write up SWIVE will use the phrase <font color="blue">"for every box of pills used"</font color="blue">

</p>
<p>

This stands for every box of 48 x 60mg, or 96 x 30mg, or 20
x 120mg.

</p>

<p>

In addition SWIVE will use the phrase <font color="blue">"for every gram of total pill mass"</font color="blue">

</p>
<p>

This stands for the total weight of the pills before
grinding.

</p>

<p>
<b>- Standard Procedure -</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>

01) Weigh pills and record total weight.

</p>

<p>

02) Place pills into a clean coffee grinder.

</p>

<p>

03) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used add:</font color="blue">
- 2 grams of washing soda<br>
- 2 grams of salt<br>
- 4 grams of activated carbon<br>
- 4 grams sodium hydroxide<br>

</p>

<p>

<i><font color="green">What if it all won't fit in the
coffee grinder.   Process about 3 - 4 boxes at a
time.

</p>

<p>

Why am I adding salt?   To attract water and to
act as an abrasive to aid in grinding.

</p>

<p>

Why am I adding washing soda?   To act as a
buffering agent.

</p>

<p>

After grinding the mixture becomes hot and doesn't sift
well?   Carbon sold for aquarium filtration may
contain excess moisture.   The moisture content
will be apparent when the carbon is ground.
Moist carbon will tend to cake on the side of the grinder,
and will feel moist.   If the carbon is moist, dry
it before use by heating in an oven or
microwave.   Take precautions handling the heated
carbon to avoid burns.   Allow the carbon to cool
before grinding or combining with other
ingredients.   Store any unused dried carbon in an
air tight container.</i></font color="green">

</p>

<p>

04) Grind the mixture to a fine powder. <font color="red">Its important that we grind the mixture as fine
and uniformly as possible, </font color="red">about the
consistency of coarse flour.

</p>

<p>

05) Sift the mixture into the beaker using a wire mesh
strainer placed inside a large funnel to minimize
dusting.   When grinding and sifting be careful
with vents, fans and open windows so your pseudo doesn't
blow away as dust.   You also dont want to inhale
NaOH or carbon dust.   Let the dust settle in the
coffee grinder before opening the lid.

</p>

<p>

06) <font color="blue">For every gram of total pill mass
add:</font color="blue">

</p>

<p>

- 1.5ml dry acetone

</p>

<p>

This measurement will get you in the ball park.
We want the mixture to be a liquid at this point, not a
paste.   Add more acetone in small increments as
the mixture will go from stiff to fluid very
quickly.   Acetone used for this purpose should be
dried before use, as the moisture content of acetone can
vary over such a wide range that the only way to obtain
consistent results it to dry the acetone before use.

</p>

<p>

07) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used add
</font color="blue"><font color="red">while stirring:</font color="red">

</p>

<p>

- 3 drops DH2O <i>(use the baby medicine dropper)</i>

</p>

<p>

<i><font color="green">Why are we using dry acetone and then
adding water?   Since the amount of moisture
present is critical for proper basing, and the water content
of non-dried acetone is widely variable, the only way to
accurately control the moisture available for basing is to
dry the acetone first, then add a measured amount of water.
</i></font color="green">

</p>

<p>

08) Stir with a glass rod for about 3 to 4
minutes.   The mixture will slowly thicken to a
wet paste.

</p>

<p>

09) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used
add:</font color="blue">

</p>

<p>

- 1.0 gram corn starch

</p>

<p>

10) Stir for a few minutes.   The mixture will
become very stiff and the consistency of damp potting soil,
with no signs of visible liquid.   Add more
cornstarch in very small increments if nessesary.

</p>

<p>

<i><font color="green">Why the cornstarch?   The
cornstarch is a great absorbent and helps to dry our mixture
fast.   When drying the cornstarch will keep our
mixture from turning into hard little rocks and when
powdered again keeps the mixture free flowing.
It also will help absorb waxy gak when we extract our free
base. </i></font color="green">

</p>

<p>

11) Spread out the mixture on the pie plate(s) and let <font color="red">dry completely.</font color="red"> It will dry
fast because the carbon has increased the surface area of
our mixture.

</p>

<p>

12) When completely dry sift the mixture back into the
beaker using the wire mesh strainer placed inside a large
funnel.

</p>

<p>

13) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used
add:</font color="blue">

</p>

<p>

- 35ml Naptha

</p>

<p>

14) Mix well.   Then place the beaker on the hot
plate set to med high heat. <font color="red">With constant
gentle stirring,</font color="red"> heat the mixture until
boiling.   Turn heat off and <font color="red">continue to stir for 1 minute.</font color="red"> Remove from hot plate and set aside to let the
solids settle out for a few minutes.

</p>

<p>

<i><font color="green">Isn't boiling naptha
dangerous?   Boiling any flammable solvent is an
extremely dangerous practice.   Solvents should
not be heated over an open flame or on any apparatus that is
capable of producing a spark.   This includes
defective or damaged electric hot plates.
Adequate ventilation is required.   This should
not be done in a closed environment due to risk of explosion
and/or fire and due to health concerns regarding inhalation
of solvent fumes.   The constant use of a fan
positioned to blow across the solvent will disburse the
vapor, reduce the risk of fire and explosion. </i></font color="green">

</p>

<p>

15) While waiting, make a charmin filter.   Take 4
plys of charmin and fold three times to make a
square.   Fold that over once and then once again
to make a quarter square.   Completely wet the
square with some clean naptha using the medicine dropper and
place the pad into the bottom of funnel across the
neck.   The Charmin should not be "packed" or
"compressed".   Gently mold the edges around the
contour of the funnel bottom.   Wet it again with
naptha and place this filter-funnel into the erlenmeyer
flask.

</p>

<p>

16) <font color="red">Slowly</font color="red"> decant the
naptha into the funnel in small amounts and allow it to
filter through the Charmin into the flask.   Don't
pour in more than can pass through the charmin in more or
less real time.   If you make a big puddle it may
start to crystalize in the funnel clogging the
filter.   The filtered naptha should be crystal
clear.   Free base crystals will start to form in
the filtrate.   Set the flask aside.

</p>

<p>

17) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used
add:</font color="blue">

</p>

<p>

- 20ml Naptha

</p>

<p>

18) Mix well.   Then place the beaker on the hot
plate set to med high heat. <font color="red">With constant
gentle stirring,</font color="red"> heat the mixture until
boiling.   Turn heat off and <font color="red">continue to stir for 1 minute.</font color="red"> Remove from hot plate and set aside to let the
solids settle out for a minute.

</p>

<p>

19) <font color="red">Slowly</font color="red"> decant the
naptha into the same filter-funnel in small amounts and
allow it to filter through the Charmin into the flask
combining filtrates.   Don't pour in more than can
pass through the charmin in more or less real
time.   Do not replace the charmin, continue to
re-use the same pad.

</p>

<p>

20) <font color="blue">For every box of pills used
add:</font color="blue">

</p>

<p>

- 10ml Naptha

</p>

<p>

21) Mix well.   Then place the beaker on the hot
plate set to med high heat.<font color="red"> With constant
gentle stirring,</font color="red"> heat the mixture until
boiling.   Turn heat off and <font color="red">continue to stir for 1 minute.</font color="red"> Remove from hot plate.

</p>

<p>

22) <font color="red">Slowly</font color="red"> decant the
naptha into the same filter-funnel in small amounts and
allow it to filter through the Charmin into the flask
combining filtrates.   Then empty the entire
contents of the beaker into the filter funnel and let drain.

</p>

<p>

23) While draining boil a small amount of naptha about 5 ml
<font color="blue">for every box of pills used. </font color="blue"> When all the liquid appears to have drained
through, pour the boiling naptha over the filter cake and
let it drain again.   Then take a large spoon and
press down on top of filter cake squeezing any remaining
naptha into the flask.

</p>

<p>

<i><font color="green">Should I do a fourth
pull.   You can try but tests have shown its
usually not enough gain to justify the effort.
Only do additional pulls if the end result is less than
45%</i></font color="green">

</p>

<p>

24) Place the erlenmeyer flask with the combined filtrate on
the hot plate set to med high.   Heat to boiling
or until all crystals have re-dissolved.   Pour
the hot filtrate into clean pie plate(s).

</p>

<p>

25) Place the pie plate(s) in the freezer and let it <font color="red">sit undisturbed for 1 hour.</font color="red">

</p>

<p>

26) Remove the pie plate(s) from the freezer and pour off
the used naptha filtering out free base crystals using a
coffee filter.   Let the collected free base
crystals dry.   Some crystals may adhere to the
pie plate.   Let them dry before removing.

</p>

<p>

27) After filtering crystals out return the used naptha to
the beaker.   Return all filtered solids including
the charmin filter to the beaker.   Break solids
up with a glass rod and mix well.   Return to hot
plate on med high heat.   With constant gentle
stirring bring the used mixture back to boiling.
Let boil for 1 minute.   Turn heat off but leave
beaker on hot plate.   Make a new charmin filter
as per previous step 15.   Filter liquid first,
then add remaining solids to funel to drain.
Then take a large spoon and press down on top of filter cake
squeezing any remaining naptha into the flask.
Place into freezer again for at least 30
minutes.   SWIVE has been picking up a few extra
percent and it helped recover one botched batch that would
of been poor otherwise.

</p>
<p>

28) The remaining naptha does contain some additional
pseudoephedrine free base.   You may wash the
naptha thoroughly with warm distilled water and titrate to
obtain the remaining pseudoephedrine in HCL
form.   This pseudoephedrine HCL will not be as
clean as the free base, and will need to be rinsed with
acetone, then recrystallized twice before being added to a
reaction.   The use of this pseudoephedrine with
the free base is not recommended.   This
pseudoephedrine HCl can be accumulated until the quantity is
sufficient to react by itself.

</p>

<p>

29) If the HCL salt is the desired outcome, redissolve the
free base crystals in to a non polar and gas accordingly.
<font color="red">Do Not gas the original Naptha.</font color="red"> If you gas the original naptha you will pick up
unwanted contaminants.   You may alternatively
move the free base crystals into a small quantity of dH2O
and add HCl drop wise with stirring until the free base
crystals all dissolve.   Evaporate over low heat
until this alligators over, then flash with dry
acetone.   Filter the acetone and pseudoehphedrine
HCL though a coffee filter, rinse with acetone, allow to
dry.

</p>

<p>

<b>- Calculating Yield -</b>

</p>

<p>

When calculating your yield remember to adjust for free
base.

</p>
<p>

Pseudo HCl is about 202gr per mole and psuedo free base is
about 166gr per mole.  So 166 divided by 202 is a ratio of
0.82 So potential yield from 1 box of 120's would be 20 x
120 x 0.82 = 1.9 grams free base vs 2.4 grams for psuedo
HCl.

</p>

<p>
<b>- Advantages and Disadvantages -</b>
</p>

<p>

The technique should be, for the near future, virtually
universal.   It should successfully extract most
pseudoephedrine pills.   The materials are easily
available and draw less attention than xylene and tolulene
purchases.   Yields should range in the sixty
percent range.   The pseudoephedrine so obtained
will be very clean--characteristic of A/B extractions of
pseudoephedrine.   The main disadvantage is
heating a flamable solvent.

<b>- Time -</b>
</p>

<p>

SWIVE can run it in about 3 hours start to finish, 4 hours
with the fourth pull.   The first few times I
would allow 5 hours to bee safe until you get the feel of
it.

</p>

<p>

Start reading all of Jacked's posts on freebase
reactions.   They are a great reference and it is
how SWIVE learned.   SWIVE has his own quirky
method now, but study Jacked's first so you really
understand the fundementals of whats happening.

</p>

<hr>
Here's the bottom line on yield.

<p>Each box of pills used has the potential or 1.9 grams of free base. This is equivalent to 2.4 grams of the HCL salt.</p>
<p>The average bee with fair lab skills should be able to consistently achieve 1 gram of super clean free base per box or 52%.</p>
<p>The experienced bee with good lab skills should be able to consistently achieve 1.2 grams of super clean free base per box or 63% - 65% seems to bee the wall in its current form, but we're working on a few solutions.</p>

<p>Crystallization can take two different forms.</p>

<p><b>The fast way:</b> Placing the hot naptha immediately in the freezer with no cool down will generally produce fine snow like crystals.</p>

<p><center><img src="pictures/straightbee1.jpg"></center></p>

<p><b>If your not in a hurry:</b> let the naptha cool to about room temperature before placing into the freezer and you will generally get large sparkling beauties like these.</p>

<p><center><img src="pictures/straightbee2.jpg"></center></p>

<p>Also bee sure to cover your naptha with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent the naptha fumes from stinking up your fridge or becoming a fire hazzard.</p>
