<FONT FACE="Arial">is </FONT>described from readily accessible alkyl bromides

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The versatile reactivity and the svnthetic usefulness
of the azido group is well documented And there are several methods available
for the synthesis of azido compounds. The most common method utilizes alkyl
halides via the nucleophilic substitution with sodium azide or lithium
azide in various solvents. However, these methodologies often suffer from
either complex procedures, long reaction times and low yields.In addition,
there are usual purification problems associated with distillations of
products from the incomplete reactions since some alkyl azides decomposes
rapidly with danger of explosion. Consequently, we decided to initiate
a systematic study of the Versatilely of the nucleophilic substitution
of halides using sodium azide, NaN3, under milder phase-transfer catalysis
conditions.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In view of the drawbacks associated with conventional
phase transfer catalysts such as low thermal stability, hygroscopicity,
separation problems and reusability prompted us to explore the synthesis
of immobilized onium cations pillared clays. Herein, we present a novel
approach to the synthesis of azides that involves triphase catalyst system
for nucleophilic displacement consisting of a dispersed solid phase and
two immiscible liquid phases containing the electrophilic and nucleophilic
reagents where the reagents get transferred from the liquid phase to the
solid phase. The usual triphase catalysts employed are functionalized organic
polymers or more popular mineral supports that contain immobilized organocations,
such as quaternary ammonium ions analogues to those used for conventional
liquid-liquid phase transfer catalysts.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Although triphase catalysis greatly simplifies the recovery
of the catalyst and provides opportunities for selective chemical conversions
based on substrate size or polarity, the technique also has some limitations.
17-19 The polymer-supported triphase catalysts have yet to find industrial
applications, in part, because of their diffusion limitations, high cost,
tendency to swell and mechanical chemical instability. Several inorganic
supports, involving metal oxides, clays and zeolites have been substituted
for polvmers but they generally suffer similar disadvantages of low reactivity
or structural Instability under sustained reaction conditions. Thus, development
of new materials for improved triphasic catalysis are desirable. We have
obtained some interesting results using exchanged clay systems containing
basic groups such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysitane (3-APTES) and much smaller
and symmetrical surfactants namely tetramethyl- , tetraethvl- and tetrabutylammonium
bromide into the clay interlayer. This Letter reports a high yield preparation
of various alkyl azides in excellent purity utilizing surfactant pillared
clays that circumvents the hazards associated with purification of alkyl
azides.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Our results for a variety of azides are summarized in
the Table and are exemplified by substrates such as benzvl bromide, substituted
benzyl bromides and long chain alkyl bromides. Benzyl bromide bearing an
electron withdrawing substituent (entry 5) undergoes the reaction at a
much faster rates as compared to the parent or benzyl bromide derivatives
with electron releasing group appended. In the case of long chain alkyl
halides e.g. geranyl bromide (entry 6) and 2-ethylhexyl bromide (entry
7), the reaction rate is much slower and needs comparatively longer time
for completion. This may be due to the increase in the electron releasing
capacity with increasing chain length and also due to restricted entry
of the hydrophobic long chain alkyl halides into the surfactant pillared
clay interlayer. In general, long chain alkyl halides require more time
to react. The reaction is found to be very slow at room temperature and
does not occur in the absence of the catalyst. Instead, benzyl bromide
is found to produce a white polymeric material when natural montmorillonite
K 10 clay is used. The reaction is also unaffected by increasing (two-fold)
or decreasing (one-half) the amount of the organo-clay composite confirming
its catalytic role. Interestingly, the catalyst can be reused without loss
in activity; we have reused the recovered clay two to three times with
reproducible results (entries 2 and 3).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">For all the substrates depicted in the Table, the organo-clay
assembly formed a thin membrane-like film at the interface of a hexane-in-water
emulsion. The emulsion formation or the catalytic activity was not observed
for the natural montmorillonite K 10 clay. The experiments performed in
biphasic catalytic conditions with onium salts produce the efficient conversion.
This trend is corroborated by earlier work and it appears that the decrease
in catalytic efficiency upon immobilization of onium ion is a general feature
of the triphasic catalysis. We have also analvzed the role of surfactant
size in this reaction by varying the alkyl group (tetramethyl-, tetraethyl-
and tetra-n-butvl ammonium bromide) and found that the conversion rate
remains essentially unchanged indicating the relative insensitivity of
the reaction towards the surfactant size,</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Materials: </I>Montmorillonite K 10 clay, tetraethvlammonium
bromide, tetra-n-butyl- bromide, 2-ethvlhexyl bromide and geranyl bromide
are purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and rest of the chemicals or reagents
are purchased from Lancaster Synthesis Inc. and used as received without
further purification. Surfactant pillared clays are prepared by stirring
sodium-exchanged clay (6 g) in 0.2 molar solution of the corresponding
surfactants for 100 h at 60-70 'C. The solution was filtered, washed repeatedly
with distilled water and dried overnight in an oven (at 100-110 degrees
C). x-ray diffraction data shows that the spatial distance in the 001 plane
increases from 9 to 16 A and FT-IR spectra displays characteristic stretching
frequencies of alkyl group.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>General procedure for the synthesis of alkyl azides.
</I>In a typical experiment, benzyl bromide (360 mg, 2.1 mmol) in petroleum
ether (3 mL) and sodium azide (180 mg, 2.76 mmol) in water (3 mL) are admixed
in a round-bottomed flask. To this stirred solution, pillared clay (100
mg) is added and the reaction mixture is refluxed with constant stirring
at 90-100 'C until all the starting material is consumed, as observed by
thin layer chromatographv using pure hexane as solvent. The reaction is
quenched with water and the product extracted into ether. The ether extracts
are washed with water and the organic layer dried over sodium sulfate.
The removal of solvent under reduced pressure affords the pure alkyl azides
as confirmed by the spectral analysis.&nbsp;</FONT>
