<h2>A Convenient, High-Yielding Method for<br>the Methylenation of Catechols</h2>

<p>The methylenedioxy group occurs in many natural products<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and, in addition, has been suggested as a 
protecting group for catechols<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, synthetically, the methylenation of catechols has never been easy 
and high yields difficult to obtain<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Bonthrone and Cornforth have shown<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> that if the reaction is carried out using dichloromethane in a dipolar 
aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide, coupled with the slow addition of a mixture of solid sodium 
hydroxide and the catechol, good yields of the methylenated catechol may be obtained. Several substituted 
catechols have been methylenated in high yield using dichloromethane in dimethylformamide or 
dimethylsulphoxide in the presence of a bronze<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, cupric oxide<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> or nickel oxide<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> catalyst. However, all 
these methods suffer from the disadvantage that they must be effected in aprotic solvents under anhydrous 
conditions.</p>

<p>We now wish to report a simple synthetic procedure, using phase transfer catalysis<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>8,9</sup></a> which gives high yields 
of methylenated catechol.</p>	

<p>In methylenation reactions the methylenating agent of choice is normally diiodomethane; however due to the 
known role of iodide ion is a catalyst poison in phase transfer catalysis<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> dibromomethane was used. The 
phase transfer catalyst selected was Adogen 464<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>, which fulfils the required criteria for effective phase 
transfer catalysis.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>
<p>A mixture of water (20 mL), dibromomethane (0.15 mole) and Adogen 464 (1 mole) was vigorously stirred and 
heated to reflux. The air in the system was displaced by nitrogen. A solution of the appropriate 
  <em>o</em>-dihydroxybenzene (0.1 mole) and sodium hydroxide (0.25 mole) in water (50 mL) vas added at such a rate that 
the addition was complete after 2 hours. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred and 
refused for a further hour. The product vas then isolated<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> and identified. Yields obtained are shown in the table.

<p>Phase transfer catalysis has recently been applied with considerable success to the methylation of some 
hindered phenols<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> and from the table it can be seen that using this technique high yields can be easily 
obtained in the methylenation of catechols. It is, however, important to ensure (<strong>i</strong>) an adequate stirring rate<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>and (<strong>ii</strong>) to add slowly the solution of catechoxide dianion to the reaction mixture, so as to avoid the 
possibility of intermolecular reaction<a href="methylenation.ptc.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
