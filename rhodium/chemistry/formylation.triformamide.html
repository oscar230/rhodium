    <p>  This wonderful reference (J. Prakt. Chem. 2000, 342, No. 3.) was found by foxy2.
If you want to know what I mean, scroll down to the tables and imagine
what (alpha-methyl)phenethylamines those benzaldehydes would give.
 I only translated the experimental part. I didn't know the english for
"Spaltrohrkolonne" (a type of fractionating column) so I translated it by
slit pipe column... </p>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>Diformamide (1) reacts with activated aromatic compounds like toluene, anisole, m-xylene, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene in the presence of AlCl3 to give N-(diarylmethyl)-formamides 2a - d, the
corresponding aromatic aldehydes 3 - 6 are formed as by-products in low yields. From N,N-dimethylaniline and 1/AlCl3 the triphenylmethane derivative 7 can be obtained. The reaction of
anisole with N-methyl-diformamide (9) affords the formamide 10. The mixture of formamide, P4O10 and AlCl3 reveals to be a reagent which is capable to formylate toluene and anisole, resp.
Triformamide (14)/AlCl3 is an effective formylating system which allows the preparation of aromatic aldehydes (e.g. 3,4,17 - 32) from the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbons. Aluminiumchloride
can be replaced by borontrichloride. The yields of the formylation reactions depend strongly from the reaction conditions (molar ratio: aromatic hydrocarbon/AlCl3/14; solvent, reaction
temperature). The scope of the reaction covers nearly complete those of the Gattermann-Koch-, Gattermann- and Vilsmeier - Haack-reaction.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Attempt at the Formylation of Anisole with 1 and Catalytical Amounts of Ytterbium-
tris(trifluoromethanesulfonate)</h3>

<p>1.08 g (10 mmol) Anisole, 0.73 g (10 mmol) 1 and 1.24 g (2 mmol) Yb(CF3SO3)3 in 10 ml
nitromethane are refluxed for 24 h. After cooling, 20 ml water is added and the reaction stirred
for 10 min at room temperature. The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase
extracted three times with 20 ml chloroform. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium
sulfate. After removing the solvent on the rotavapor, the residue was analysed with GC. Only
anisole could be detected.</p>

<h3>Formylation of Activated Aromatics with Formamide/P4O10/AlCl3 (general procedure)</h3>

<p>To the aromatic compound, when necessary in a solvent, is added the given amount of P4O10.
Under stirring and cooling in an ice bath first the aluminium chloride, then the formamide are
added. Then the mixture is heated to the given temperature and stirred. After cooling the reaction
is hydrolysed with ice and extracted three times with 30 ml chloroform. The organic phase is
washed with sodium bicarbonate solution and water to make it neutral and dried over sodium
sulfate. The chloroform is removed on the rotavapor and the residue fractionated under aspirator
vacuum. Toluene, P4O10, AlCl3 and formamide are reacted with a 0.5:0.1:0.2:0.1 molar ratio for
3 h, yield: 9% 3. The reaction of anisole, P4O10, AlCl3 and formamide with a molar ratio of
0.4:0.1:0.2:0.1 (18h, 28 °C) gives 12% 4. The same reaction with a molar ratio of 0.5:0.1:0.2:0.1
(2.5 h, 75 °C) in nitromethane gives 4 with a yield of 15%. The same reaction in chlorobenzene
with a molar ratio of 0.18:0.6:0.18:0.18 (4h, 60 °C) gives 4 with 4% yield. N,N-Dimethylaniline,
P4O10, AlCl3, Formamide are reacted with a molar ratio of 0.1:0.1:0.2:0.1 for 23 h at 20 °C.
There is no conversion.</p>

<h3>Formylation of Toluene with Aluminium Chloride and Triformamide in Toluene</h3>

<p>To 46.0g (500 mmol) toluene is added 20.0g (150 mmol) AlCl3 under cooling in an ice bath.
Then 5.1g triformamide (50 mmol) is added. The reaction is stirred for 5 h at 0 °C. The mixture
is hydrolysed with ice, neutralised with 5M NaOH and steam distilled. The organic phase of the
distillate is separated, the aqueous phase extracted twice with diethylether. The combined organic
phases are dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed on the rotavapor and the residue
distilled at aspirator vacuum. One obtains 4.74 g tolylaldehyde (79%) with bp 80 °C / 12 Torr
(Lit 8 bp. 82-84  °C / 12 Torr). The residue of the steam distillation is extracted three times with
diethylether. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate, the solvent removed on
the rotavapor and the residue distilled at the oil pump. One obtains 11.1 g (93%) 2a with a bp of
165 °C/0.001 Torr.</p>

<h3>Formylation of Aromatic Compounds with Triformamide/AlCl3 (cf tables 2-4) (General
Procedure)</h3>

<p>To a 2 M solution of the aromatic compound in the given solvent is added the corresponding
amount of lewis acid. Under stirring at the given temperature triformamide is added, when
necessary the mixture is stirred for some time, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction stirred
for the given amount of time at room temperature. In order to release the aldehyde, ice water
(about 200 ml, if 40 mmol of the aromatic compound are formylated) is added under agitation and
the mixture heated for 20 min to 50 °C.</p>

<p><b>Method A:</b>The hydrolysed reaction is steam distilled (Note 6). The organic phase of the distillate
is separated and the aqueous phase extracted three times with the given solvent (when alkylating
40 mmol, about 15 ml). After drying of the combined organic phases, the solvent is distilled off
using a 30 cm vigreux column. The aldehyde is obtained by fractionating the residue through a 15
or 30 cm vigreux column.</p>

<p><b>Method B:</b>The organic phase of the hydrolyzed reaction is separated. The aqueous phase is
extracted four times with the given solvent (when alkylating 40 mmol, about 20 ml). The
combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed by distilling
through a 30 cm vigreux column. The aldehyde is obtained by vacuum distillation of the residue
(Note 7). Very high boiling compounds which crystallize, are vacuum filtered and re-crystallized.</p>

<p><b>Table 2:</b> 40 mmol of the aromatic compound are reacted with 40 mmol aluminium chloride and 40
mmol 14 in 20-25 ml dry chlorobenzene.</p>

<h3>Deviating from the general procedure, the following compounds were synthesized:</h3>

 <p><b>10-Methylantracene-9-carboxyaldehyde(30)</b></p>

 <p><b>Method A:</b> The aldehyde crystallising from the residue of the steam distillation is vacuum filtered
off and recrystallised from Water/IPA/THF 3:5:3. By evaporation of the mother liquor more
product can be obtained.</p>

<b>10-Formyl-phenothiazin</b>

<p><b>Method B:</b> Reaction in chlorobenzene (3 C/0.5 h and 20 C/ 1.5 h). The extraction of the water
is done with DCM. The formyl compound is isolated by distillation, then recrystallized first from
ethanol, then from PE/EA (10:1). mp 145°C, Lit 28 mp 145°C.<p>

<p><b>4-Hexylbenzaldehyde (36) and 2,4-dihexylbenzaldehyde (37)</p></b>

<p>(Trials nr. 2-4, table 5): To 6.49 g (40 mmol) n-hexylbenzene in 20 ml 1,2-dichloroethane cooled
to -15 °C is added aluminium chloride (amount given in table 5). The mixture is stirred for some
minutes and then 4.0 g (40 mmol) triformamide is added. In trial nr. 3 the triformamide was added
directly after the aluminium chloride.</p>

<p>The reaction is stirred for 15-17h under moisture protection, letting the temperature slowly climb
to the value given in table 5. Ice water is added carefully, after completed hydrolysis, the organic

cooled to -15 °C are added under stirring 133.4 g (1000 mmol) AlCl3 during 3 min. During the
addition, the temperature of the mixture increases for some degrees centigrade.
The mixture is cooled to -15 °C, stirred for 8 min and 50.5g (500 mmol) triformamide is added.
The reaction is stirred for 24h under moisture protection, while the temperature is slowly (!)
allowed to climb to 9 °C. Then the yellow-brown, viscous and nearly homogeneous mixture is
poured slowly into 2.5 l ice with stirring. The reaction is stirred for some minutes, the organic
phase separated and the aqueous phase extracted three times with 90 ml 1,2-dichloroethane. The
combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent removed by

40 cm vigreux column. After a little forerun (cyclohexylbenzene) one obtains a first fraction of
31.1g (31%) 38 with bp of 80-85 °C/0.1 torr. The second fraction with a bp of about 137-
145 °C/0.1 torr, consists mainly of 2,4-dicyclohexylbenzaldehyde. By further fractionating
