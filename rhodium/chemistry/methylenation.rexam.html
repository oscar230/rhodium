<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>A re-examination of the methylenation reaction of 1-hydroxy-2-mercapto-, 1,2-dihydroxy- and 1,2-dimercapto
substituted benzenes by bromochloromethane with cesium carbonate shows that these substrates give mixtures of
five- and ten-membered benzocondensed heterocyclic compounds and in some cases even dibenzodioxines.</p>
</div>

<p>In previous papers we reported a systematic study on bimetallation of aromatics promoted by the
thioethereal group. Recently, this research has been extended to 1,3-benzodioxoles and
1,3-benzoxathioles<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>1,2</sup></a> because these systems are contained in natural compounds, in bioactive molecules
and in materials showing non-linear optical properties<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>3-8</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It is known that these compounds can be prepared condensing 1,2-benzodioles or 2-hydroxybenzenethioles with
dichloromethane or dibromomethane in the presence of alkaline hydroxides or fluorides or potassium carbonate
or sodium hydride in various solvents (DMSO, DMF, HMPA) with or without catalytic amounts of bronze, nickel
oxide or cupric oxide<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>9-15</sup></a>. Good results can be obtained using phase transfer catalysts<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>16,17</sup></a>. More recently, the methylenation of a variety of catechols has been reported, employing
cesium carbonate and bromochloromethane in N,N-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In this work we intend to verify if this method can be applied to the methylenation of 2-hydroxybenzenethiol (<strong>1a</strong>).</p>

<p>All reactions were performed in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide reacting <strong>1a</strong>, cesium carbonate and
bromochloromethane. Reaction yields were determined by HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture obtained after
extraction with solvents. The products were isolated as pure by flash chromatography (<strong>Scheme 1</strong>).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the expected 1,3-benzoxathiole (<strong>2a</strong>), liquid at room temperature<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>, was obtained
in a 32% yield, while the main product (65% yield) was a solid with mp 148–150°C: its elemental analysis was
equal to 2a, but its mass spectrum showed a molecular ion M<sup>+</sup> of 276, corresponding to the dimer <strong>3a</strong>.
Furthermore, the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of <strong>2a</strong> showed the methylene singlet at &delta; 5.50<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>, while
the solid product showed two singlets of equal intensity at &delta; 4.12 and 5.89 attributable to the two methylenes in <strong>3a</strong>.</p>

<p>For a better understanding of this methylenation reaction, we decided to re-examine the reactions with
catecholic derivatives. Using 1,2-benzodiol and its derivatives the reaction gave a mixture of benzodioxole
and tetraoxecine derivatives. In detail, methyl derivatives <strong>1c</strong> and <strong>1d</strong> gave a significant amount of
tetraoxecines ranging between 26 and 30%: in fact <strong>1c</strong> gave a 1.1:1 mixture of two isomeric tetraoxecines <strong>3c</strong> and
<strong>3’c</strong>; while 1d gave an almost equimolar mixture of <strong>3d</strong> and <strong>3’d</strong>. Employing the methoxy derivative <strong>1g</strong>, we obtained
a mixture of the benzodioxole <strong>2g</strong> (68%) and the isomeric tetraoxecine <strong>3g</strong> and <strong>3’g</strong> (17%) beside two isomeric
dibenzodioxines <strong>4</strong> (or <strong>4’</strong>) and <strong>5</strong> (or <strong>5’</strong>), in almost equal amounts (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>).</p>

<p>Then we decided to apply this reaction protocol to 1,2-dimercaptobenzene (<strong>1h</strong>): 1,3-benzodithiole (<strong>2h</strong>) (98%)
was obtained almost exclusively beside traces amount of unknown products.</p>

<p>The same reactions performed in acetonitrile and at different concentrations gave analogous results. At the
end we can deduce that when the benzene ring bears two equally nucleophilic groups (benzodioles and
dimercaptobenzenes) the main product is the one with a five-membered ring; when the groups have a different
nucleophilic power the main product is the ten-membered ring.</p>

<p>The structure determination of all products was performed by comparison with commercial authentic samples
or by spectroscopic techniques. For example all 3 compounds show a mass spectrum with a similar fragmentation
pattern, with a low abundance molecular ion and a base peak represented by a ion <strong>I</strong> or <strong>II</strong>, both of which have
greater aromatic character than the molecular ion (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).</p>

<h4>Scheme 1</h4>

</div>

<p>Two isomers <strong>3c</strong> and <strong>3'c</strong> were identified by <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis of their mixture. The HPLC analysis
revealed two peaks with very close retention times (4.38 and 4.59 min, respectively) so that their separation
appeared to be very difficult. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of their mixture showed two singlets at &delta; 2.26 and
2.28 in the ratio of 1:1.1, attributable to the methyl groups of the two isomers; two singlets at &delta; 5.57 and
5.62 were due to the non-equivalents methylenes of the more abundant isomer <strong>3c</strong> and another singlet at &delta; 5.56
was attributed to the two methylenes of the isomer <strong>3’c</strong>.</p>

<p>For <strong>3d</strong> and <strong>3’d</strong> the HPLC analysis of their mixture revealed only one peak. The two isomers were identified
by the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of their mixture: two singlets at &delta; 5.61 and 5.65 were attributed to the two
non-equivalents methylenes of the more abundant isomer <strong>3d</strong> and a singlet at &delta; 5.63 was attributed to the two
methylenes of <strong>3’d</strong>. The relative intensity of these signals revealed a ratio between the two isomers <strong>3d</strong>/<strong>3’d</strong> of
1.1:1. The methyl groups of the two isomers gave only one signal at &delta; 2.33.</p>

<p>Following the reaction of <strong>1g</strong> chromatography gave <strong>2g</strong> and an inseparable mixture of <strong>3g</strong> and <strong>3’g</strong>. Also isolated
was a mixture of isomeric dibenzodioxines. The compound <strong>3g</strong> was identified by two singlets, due to the
methylenes, at d 5.57 and 5.73 in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, while another singlet at 5.85 was attributed
to the equivalent methylenes of <strong>3’g</strong>. On the contrary, we were unable to separate the two dibenzodioxines <strong>4</strong> and
<strong>5</strong> because their HPLC retention times were too close (5.05 and 5.3 min, respectively): then we performed
several successive flash-chromatographies to enrich the mixture in one isomer. We reached a mixture
composition of 5:1 and its elemental analysis and mass spectrum were identical to the ones of the 1:1 mixture.
The mass spectrum showed the molecular ion as base peak and a very poor fragmentation, typical of aromatic
compounds. The enrichment made easier the assignment of some signals in the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C
NMR spectra, but it was not possible to attribute them to one of the four possible structures. The formation
of the benzodioxines was completely unexpected: in fact these compounds are usually obtained through
nucleophilic substitution by phenoxide anion on aryl halides or by self-condensation of 2-halogenophenols<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>19,20</sup></a>. We may tentatively justify the formation of these benzocondensed compounds by a radical process involving a
semiquinone radical, which can easily be formed in alkaline solution by oxidation. This anion radical then attacks the
already formed benzodioxole leading to the condensed <strong>4</strong> (or <strong>4’</strong>) and <strong>5</strong> (or <strong>5’</strong>).</p>

<p>The molecular ion of <strong>3’f</strong> gave a particularly low abundance peak because the two CHO in para to the OCH<sub>2</sub>O
led to a predominance of the symmetric fragmentation showed in the following structure (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>).</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
<h4>1.2. Materials</h4>

<p>Reagent-grade commercially available reagents and solvents were used. 2-Hydroxybenzenethiol (<strong>1a</strong>), 1,2-benzodiol derivatives (<strong>1b–f</strong>) and 1,2-dimercaptobenzene (<strong>1g</strong>) were purchased (<em>Aldrich</em>).</p>

<h4>1.3. General method of methylenation of compounds 1a–h</h4>

<p>To a suspension of the starting compound <strong>1a–h</strong> (50 mmol), cesium carbonate (24.4 g, 75 mmol) and anhydrous
N,N-dimethylformamide (120 mL), was added dropwise bromochloromethane (9.6 g, 75 mmol) and the resulting
mixture was vigorously stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere and then heated at 107–110°C for 2 h. The mixture
was poured into water, the organic layer separated and the aqueous layer extracted with ether and then with
dichloromethane, because ether is able to extract only the monomeric product while the dimeric ones are
extracted by dichloromethane. The organic phases were dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The solvent was
evaporated in vacuo and the residue was analysed by HPLC.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.1.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1a</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed the presence of two products. The extract was flash-
  chromatographed using light petroleum as eluent. The first fraction was identified as <strong>2a</strong> by comparison of its
  NMR and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample; yield 32%; pale yellow oil, bp 101–102°C/10 mmHg
  (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> bp 93–95°C/5 mmHg). pale yellow oil, bp 65–66°C/10 mmHg (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a> bp 60°C/9 mmHg).</p>
<p>The second
fraction was identified as <strong>3b</strong> by comparison with an authentic sample; yield 11%; crystallised from acetic acid
as white crystals, mp 262°C (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a> mp 261–262°C).</p>

<p><strong>1.3.3.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1c</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed three peaks: two peaks had very close retention times
  (4.38 and 4.59 min, respectively) so that their separation appeared to be very difficult.</p>

comparison of its NMR and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample; yield 70%; pale yellow oil, bp
60°C/3 mmHg (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a> bp 45°C/1.2 mmHg). The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis of the second fraction showed the
presence of two isomers <strong>3c</strong> and <strong>3’c</strong> in a 1.1:1 ratio; total yield 26%; crystallised from acetic acid as white
crystals, mp 190–192°C.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.4.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1d</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed two peaks. The extract was flash-chromatographed using
  light petroleum as eluent. The first fraction was identified as <strong>2d</strong> by comparison of its NMR and mass spectra
  with those of an authentic sample; yield 68%; pale yellow oil, bp 115–117°C/3 mmHg (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a> bp 196–197°C/753.5 mmHg).</p>
<p>The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis of the second fraction (corresponding to the second HPLC peak)
showed the presence of two isomers <strong>3d</strong> and <strong>3’d</strong> in a 1.1:1 ratio; total yield 29%; crystallised from acetic acid
as white crystals, mp 219–220°C.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.5.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1e</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed the presence of two products. The extract was flash-
  chromatographed using 10:1 hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent. The first fraction was identified as <strong>2e</strong> by
  comparison of its NMR and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample; yield 88%; crystallised from ethanol
  as white crystals, mp 32–34°C (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a> mp 33°C).</p>
<p>The second fraction was identified as <strong>3e</strong>. Yield 10%, crystallised from acetic acid as a white solid, mp 200–202°C.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.6.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1f</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed the presence of two products. The extract was flash-
  chromatographed using 10:1 hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent. The first fraction was identified as <strong>2f</strong> by
  comparison of its NMR and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample; yield 88%; crystallised from ethanol
  as white crystals, mp 36–37°C (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>24</sup></a> mp 37°C).</p>

<p><strong>1.3.7.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1g</strong>. </p>
<p>The HPLC analysis showed four peaks. The mixture was flash-chromatographed
  using 9:1 ether/light petroleum as eluent. The first fraction was identified as <strong>2g</strong> by comparison of its NMR
  and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample; yield 68%; crystallised from ethanol as white crystals, mp
  41–42°C (lit.<a href="methylenation.rexam.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a> mp 39–41°C).</p>
<p>The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis of the second fraction (corresponding to
the second HPLC peak) shows the presence of two isomers <strong>3g</strong> and <strong>3’g</strong> in a 1.1:1 ratio; yield 17%; crystallised
from methanol as white crystals, mp 205–206°C.</p>

<p>The third fraction was identified as a 1:1 mixture of two products <strong>4</strong> (or <strong>4’</strong>) and <strong>5</strong> (or <strong>5’</strong>). Yield 10%. This
mixture was isolated by chromatography as a white solid with mp 219–220°C.</p>

<p>After repeated column
chromatographies on silica using light petroleum as eluent the mixture was enriched in one of the two
components reaching a ratio of 5:1. The mp of this mixture was 232–234°C. The elemental analysis and mass
spectrum of the 5:1 mixture were identical to those of the 1:1 mixture.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.8.</strong> Methylenation of <strong>1h</strong>. </p>
