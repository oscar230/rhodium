	<h1>Synthesis of N-Methylisopropylamine</h1>

<p>This is an easy synth of N-Methylisopropylamine. This amine can be used to synthetise the MIPT family of tryptamines (MIPT, 5-Meo-MIPT and 4-MeO-MIPT) by
S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement on brominated or tosylated tryptophols, alternatively through indole-3-glyoxylchlorides (made from indoles and oxalyl chloride).</p>

<h4>Experimental Part</h4>

<p>To 59 g (one mole) anhydrous isopropylamine (stirred and cooled with an external ice bath), there was added 85.7 g (one mole) 35% aqueous formaldehyde solution. During
the addition, an oily layer of 1,3,5-tris(isopropyl)hexahydro- 1,3,5-triazine is formed.</p>

<p>After 15 min the oily layer is separated and dried over anhydrous K2CO3 for 12 hours in the refrigerator (4°C), yield: 83% of theory.</p>

<p>40 grams of the triazine is added slowly to a cooled (-5°C) acidic (no further specification of "acidic") suspension of 70 grams Zn dust in 200 ml H<sub>2</sub>0 with strong
stirring. During the addition, simultaneous 320 ml concentrated HCl is added, dropwise at -5°C. After complete addition, one hour further stirring, filter off the
residual Zn dust and add the filtrate to a 40% NaOH solution (90°C hot) in a three-necked-RBF equipped with a stirrer and a liebig condenser. The liberated N-
methylisopropylamine (b.p. 50-60°C @ normal pressure) is trapped in a cooled recieving flask and finally fractionally redistilled with a 30 cm vigreux column. The main
fraction has a bp of 49-51°C . The picrate has a mp of 135°C, but requires 3-4 days for crystallization from Et<sub>2</sub>O/EtOH.</p>

<p>Traces of isopropylamine can be seen with GC analysis (shorter retention time) and N,N-dimethylisopropylamine (longer retention time).</p>

<p><strong>Notes from Nemo_Tenetur:</strong></p>

<p>This is a valuable synthesis. N-Methylisoproylamine is hard to get (only a few suppliers) and outrageous expensive. Five years ago I've bought 50 ml from Sigma-Aldrich for
almost 90$ ! Unfortunately, the above recipe gave no final yield claim, but the required chemicals are cheap, so it does pay even with a moderate final yield.
The N-methyl-N-isopropyl substitution pattern is a good choice!</p>
