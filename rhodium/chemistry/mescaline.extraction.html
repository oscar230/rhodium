<p>

<b>Step 1: Aqueous Extraction</b>

</p>

<p>

First, you need to prepare a &quot;tea&quot; from your cacti. If using
dried cactus, powder it. If using fresh cactus, chop it to small
pieces and then puree it in a blender. At this point, it is a good
idea to weigh your cactus and record the weight. This will be helpful
further on in the process. Put the cactus in your stainless steel pot
and cover with just enough water to make a soup. Add some acid to make
the pH of the soup fairly acidic. If using citric acid, you want to
add about 3 grams per liter of water. Boil the cactus about 20
minutes. If you use sufficiently acidic water, there is no need to
boil longer than this. After boiling, strain out the cactus chunks
(the marc) and save the liquid.  You want to do three acidic water
extractions on the cactus. Combine the 3 liquids and toss the marc on
your compost pile or dispose of it in some other non-wasteful manner.
If the volume of liquid you have is large, you may want to boil it
down to a more managable quantity.


</p>

<p>

<b>Step 2: De-Fatting</b>

</p>

<p>

Once cooled, the next step is to de-fat the solution. This step will
remove the fats and many other non-alkaloidal plant matter. Make sure
the solution is acidic (pH 4 is good) before doing this. If the
solution is acidic, the alkaloids will be in a salt form which is
soluble in water but not in xylene. Pour the solution into a glass jar
(or separatory funnel, if available). Add 25-50% of the solution
volume in xylene. For example, if you have 200ml of solution, add
50-100ml of xylene. Put the lid on the jar and gently turn the jar
over 50 to 100 times. Do not shake the mixture vigorously as this
could result in emulsions that will be difficult to separate. (If you
do end up with an emulsion layer, which looks like a thin layer of
poorly separated bubbles, bathing the jar in hot water can help
separate the emulsion.  If the emulsion layer is thin enough, you may
wish to just discard it rather than taking the time to let it
separate.) Once mixed, let the jar sit and separate out into the
different layers. When this is done, you will have a top layer of
solvent, a middle fatty layer, and a bottom layer containing the
acidic aqueous solution (and the alkaloids).

</p>

<p>

If you are using a separatory funnel, drain out the bottom aqueous
layer and throw away the top two layers.  Alternatively, use a turkey
baster to siphon off the top two layers and discard them. (Make sure
you dispose of all solvents safely! Do not flush it down the toilet if
you have a septic tank. If pouring it down a sewer-connecting drain,
make sure to wash it down with large amounts of water.) You will
likely find that the turkey baster only gets off most of the solvent
and fat layers. To get the thin layer that the turkey baster can't
get, try this trick. Siphon off all of the remaining solvent and fat
layers, as well as some of the top of the aqueous layer. Put this
liquid into a tall thin glass container (a graduated cylinder or test
tube, for example), and let it separate back into layers. Then, use an
eye dropper to get off the solvent and fat layers, then add the
remaining aqueous solution back to the main jar.

</p>

<p>

There is one other possibile approach to separating the layers.
Because xylene freezes at -47.7 degrees Celsius, a separation can be
done in the freezer. Put the container in the freezer and let it sit
for a few hours until the water has frozen solid. The xylene can then
be poured off and discarded. I do not know if this will work for
defatting, as I do not know the freezing point of cactus fats. If the
fats freeze at freezer temperatures, it may not be possible to pour
them off with the xylene. This freezing technique can certainly be
used later on in steps 4 and 5 to separate the xylene and water
layers, however.

</p>

<p>

Repeat the de-fatting process two more times, or until you no longer
get a fatty layer after separation. Make sure that you have good
ventilation through the whole de-fatting process (or any time you are
working with xylene). If you begin to feel light-headed or nauseous,
or get a headache, go outside immediately and breathe fresh air until
you feel better. Also, make sure there are no open flames or sparks as
xylene is quite flammable.

</p>

<p>

<b>Step 3: Basification</b>

</p>

<p>

After de-fatting, slowly add sodium hydroxide to the aqueous solution
until the pH is up around 10.  Rather than adding dry sodium
hydroxide, it may be wise to prepare a solution of sodium hydroxide in
water, and add this. Be careful when mixing the sodium hydroxide and
water, as the mixture will cause an exothermic (heat producing)
reaction. Do not prepare the mixture in heat-sensitive containers.
When working with sodium hydroxide, remember that it is a highly
caustic material and can burn you badly.  Avoid contact, especially
with the yes, and if any gets on you wash the spot immediately with
plenty of water. It is highly recommended that you wear protective
gloves and goggles when working with sodium hydroxide or other
hazardous chemicals.

</p>

<p>

Be aware that once you do this step, you need to continue the
extraction at least up through the xylene extraction because leaving
the alkaloids in a strongly basic solution will cause them to start
breaking down after several hours. Making the solution basic turns the
alkaloids into their free base forms, which are soluble in xylene.

</p>

<p>

<b>Step 4: Extraction of Free Bases</b>

</p>

<p>

Once the solution is basic, xylene using the same ratio as used during
the de-fatting process. Again, mix the solution thoroughly but gently
to avoid emulsions. Let the solution sit, and it will separate out
into two layers. On the bottom will be a basic aqueous solution, and
on the top will be a xylene layer which now contains the alkaloids.
Using either a separatory funnel or a siphoning process, collect the
xylene layer and set it aside. Since there will still be significant
alkaloids in the aqueous layer, repeat this process two more times.
Combine all the xylene and discard the remaining aqueous solution.

</p>

<p>

If you are using a separatory funnel, gas may be formed when adding
xylene to the basic solution. To prevent pressure from building up and
potentially leading to an explosion, vent the separatory funnel
occasionally. If you are using a jar, you should remove the lid.

</p>

<p>

<b>Step 5: Salt Formation and Extraction</b>

</p>

<p>

The next step is to add acidic water to the xylene. This will cause
the alkaloids to convert to their salt forms, which are soluble in
water but not xylene. If using hydrochloric acid from the hardware
store, it will already be diluted and may be usable as is. Read the
label to find the concentration. One source says, &quot;HCl from the
hardware store is generally between 24%-36% HCl. This is far from
dilute. Indeed, upon opening the container, a visible plume of white
vapor can be seen creeping out of the bottle. First the lungs start to
burn, then any skin which is exposed to the air starts to sting...
This should be diluted, especially if it is going to be worked with
without a fume hood. 20 drops acid per 500ml of water may even be
sufficient.&quot;

</p>

<p>

If using vinegar (acetic acid), it comes quite diluted (around 5%) and
should be used as is. It would probably be best to use plain white
vinegar. I do not know what else is in vinegar other than water and
acetic acid, but it is likely other chemicals remain from the original
wine, and this may affect your final product. There should not be any
harmful products from using vinegar, since it is a food-safe product,
but you may not get nice crystals after evaporation.

</p>

<p>

If using citric acid (which is the recommended choice), prepare a
solution of citric acid powder with a small amount of water. I
recommend using citric acid because unlike hydrochloric acid, it is
food-safe and safe to handle, and unlike either hydrochloric acid or
vinegar, it is available in pure form. I have been told that using
hydrochloric or acetic acid has the advantage that both are volatile
and that excess will evaporate off, unlike citric acid. However, since
neither are easily available in pure form, it is still probably better
to use citric acid. Beware that if you do use hydrochloric acid and
let it evaporate, the fumes can be hazardous and the evaporation
should not be done where you might breathe in the vapors.

</p>

<p>

For this step, it is useful to have some idea how much alkaloid should
be in your cactus extract. If you weighed your cactus before
extraction. Trichocereus pachanoi has been analyzed with mescaline
contents of 0.025-0.12% fresh weight (0.331-2.0% dry weight).
Mescaline is usually around 50% or more of total alkaloid content. You
will want to add an equimolar quantity of acid to the solution.

</p>

<p>

If you can't or don't want to estimate the alkaloid content, Trout
gives the following work-around: add very small quantities of acidic
water to the xylene, let separate, and then collect the water layer.
Check the pH of the water, and it should be neutral. Repeat this with
small batches of acidic solution until the water layers come out
acidic. Trout points out that &quot;Something to keep in mind is that
neutralization won't always be immediate. pH should be checked after a
few minutes to see how it is, adjusted if needed and rechecked a few
minutes later.&quot;

</p>

<p>

If you are using citric acid and you are not worried about having
citric acid powder in the final product, you can just add enough
acidic water to make the solution slightly acidic, and repeat this
once or twice, then combine the extracted water layers. As citric acid
is both food-safe and a solid powder, this is a sloppy but safe
approach. Shulgin suggests that this may be a better approach than
stopping when the water layers stop coming out neutral: &quot;My gut
feeling is that there may be quite a bit of alkaloid still in the
xylene, and maybe a couple of extracts with more aqueous acid would be
useful. True, it may load the product down with excess citric acid,
but the increased yield might be worth it.&quot;

</p>

<p>

However you approach it, after the acidification and water extraction
step, discard the xylene. Again, make sure to dispose of it in a safe
manner.

</p>

<p>

Theoretically, this step could be skipped entirely, and you could just
let the xylene evaporate. This would leave behind mescaline (and the
other alkaloids) in free bas form, which is an oil. This is not
recommended however, as mescaline oil is highly caustic and it would
burn your skin to touch it. Since its an oil, it would also not be
possible to put into capsules.  Perhaps you could put the oil into
some acidic fruit juice and safely drink it, but it is still
preferable to go through this step to produce a salt form. Perhaps it
may even be smokable, though I know of no reports of anyone trying to
smoke (or vaporize, rather) free base cactus alkaloids. The boiling
point for mescaline free base is around 180 degrees Celsius. One final
concern is that free base mescaline oil may not have the shelf life of
a salt.

</p>

<p>

<b>Step 6: Evaporation</b>

</p>

<p>

Finally, pour the water into a large pyrex baking pan. Set it in a
protected location to evaporate. Let it evaporate slowly at room
temperature rather than using heat, as this will give you a better
chance of producing nice crystals. After the water has fully
evaporated, scrape up the crystals (or whatever solid mass you end up
with) and put them in capsules or a vial for storage.

</p>

<p>

Keep in mind that when measuring doses, there are a few things to
consider. First, your extract will contain all the alkaloids from the
cactus, not just the mescaline. Second, depending on what acid you
used in step 5, you will have different salts of the alkaloids. For
example, if you used citric acid, you will have mescaline citrate (as
well as citrate salts of the other alkaloids). If you used vinegar,
you will have mescaline acetate. If you used muriatic acid you will
have mescaline hydrochloride. The doses of each will be slightly
different, due to the different molecular weights of the different
acids. Because of these factors, you will need to figure out the
potency of your material before you can weigh doses accurately.


</p>

<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>

</p>

<p>

Do make sure that you follow all safety instructions religiously.
Failure to excersize caution can easily lead to harm and even death.
To stress this point even further, I will close with some comments
from Trout:

</p>

<p>

&quot;It seems like it does not matter how many times you tell some
people things, lots of them decide what THEY think is really important
and items like solvent exposure and not using plastics or solvents
stored in plastics (or even the use of slow and careful heating) get
forgotten whenever it is not convenient to follow the instructions.

</p>

<p>

Its very distressing how careless some people are. Worse, people like
this often expose not just themselves but family, children and pets
with no thought or concern.

</p>

<p>

You would not believe some of the letters I have gotten. Some of them
I almost can't shred fast enough.

</p>

<p>

I'm sadly coming to believe that a simple citrate tea (lime not lemon)
or else dried outer flesh consumed as powder are the only safe
approaches the general public is capable of handling
responsibly.&quot;

<b>crystallization using sulfuric acid</b>

</p>

<p>

Just replace steps 5 and 6 above with the step below:

</p>

<p>

This method relies on the low solubility of mescaline sulfate in very
cold water.

</p>

<p>

(this is not tested from personal experience, but sourced from Trout:
Sacred Cacti and Selected Succulents, 1997)

</p>

<p>

<b>Step 5: Salt Formation and Crystallization</b>

</p>

<p>

Once you have separated the organic solvent, dark (or in the case of
recrystallization at least yellow) with alkaloid and impurities from
the basic solution, extract it with dilute sulfuric acid. Use only as
much as is required to neutralize the alkaloid bases. A little excess
at this point is not desirable, but not of concern. Separate the small
volume of aqueous solution now containing the mescaline sulfate and
other alkaloid sulfates.

</p>

<p>

It will need gentle heat to reduce it somewhat, but do not let it
become thick, or overheat. Take this solution while warm and insulate
it well (a small styrofoam shipping box will work as will being
carefully wrapped in towels). Stick the whole thing in your
refrigerator until quite cold (near 0C) but do not freeze.

</p>

<p>

The object is to retard the rate of cooling to as slow as possible.
This will cause the formation of large, beautiful crystals. If you
chill rapidly a crystalline mush of many tiny crystals will form,
trapping impurities.

</p>

<p>

Take the mother liquor containing the crystals and pour through a
buchner funnel. Allow the air to keep sucking through the crystals.
Briefly squirt a bit of ice cold water through the crystals to rinse
them of any remaining solution. Turn off the air flow briefly and
immediately dump out the mother liquor and ice water rinsing and save.

</p>

<p>

Rapidly resume air flowing through the Buchner. Then quickly rinse the
crystals with a little acetone to remove the remaining water. Let the
air keep flowing to pull off as much liquid as possible. (If one has
access to a cold room all of this will be more efficient).

</p>

<p>

Take the filter and immediately dry in a warm oven (120-120F) with the
door open. Package as soon as dry and keep away from light, heat,
moisture, air.

</p>

<p>

Second and third crops of crystals may be obtained by reducing the
mother liquor further (do not allow to become thick) and again
chilled. By the third or fourth time other alkaloids will begin to
crystallize. These may be grey in colour and have a plate-like
structure. They should be easily distinguishable from the beautiful
yellow or white needles and prisms of mescaline sulfate.

</p>

<p>

The sulfate salt can be converted to the hydrochloride salt by acid
base and evaporation if so required.
