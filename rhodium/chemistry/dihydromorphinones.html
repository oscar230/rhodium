<div class="stdtxt">

		<p>These german patents from the 1930's all 
          describe the rearrangement of morphine, codeine and ethylmorphine 
          into the corresponding dihydromorphinones. The first uses immense amounts 
          of platinum or palladium in acid solution to affect the rearrangement, 
          the second uses a lot less catalyst, and the last one uses alcohol as 
          solvent, in which the reaction proceeds without any acid added.</p>

        <p>It is well known that morphine and its ethers, through treatment with 
          hydrogen gas in the presence of large amounts of noble metal catalysts 
          through heating the acid solution, can be transformed to the dihydrated 
          keto derivatives.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, it was now found that for this transformation to take 
          place, hydrogen is completely unnecessary, and that just heating the 
          acidified alkaloid solution with a larger amount of finely divided platinum 
          row metals, will suffice to affect the simultaneous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation 
          in good yields.</p>
        <p>This success is particularly unexpected because it was not to be foreseen 
          that platinum metal not saturated with hydrogen is capable to use the 
          hydrogen originating from the dehydrogenation <em>[of the alcohol in the 6-position]</em> almost 
          quantitatively for the hydrogenation of the double bond <em>[in the 7-8 
          position]</em> of morphine or its analogs without in addition of excess hydrogen 
          from an external source.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p>300 grams of codeine free base was dissolved in 2000ml dilute HCl, 
          and after the addition of 150 grams finely divided palladium, the mixture 
          was heated under reflux for one hour. After the palladium was filtered 
          off, the acid filtrate was basified with NaOH solution. The base which 
          separated was recrystallized from alcohol. Yield of dihydrocodeinone 
          75-85%, mp 195&deg;C.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
        <p> 5 grams of codeine hydrochloride was dissolved in 30 ml water, and 
          acidified with a little HCl, and after the addition of 4 grams platina 
          black, the solution was refluxed for 5 hours. After workup as in <strong>Example 
          1</strong>, the yield was 65-75% of theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
        <p>5 g of morphine HCl was dissolved in 50ml water, slightly acidified 
          with HCl, and 5 grams of platina black was added and the solution refluxed 
          for 4 hours. Workup as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. Yield 2.5 grams dihydromorpinone.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
        <p> To a solution of codeine hydrochloride, slightly acidified with HCl, 
          50 ml of a 10% solution of colloidal platinum was added, and the solution 
          was refluxed for 3 hours. Workup as in example 1. Yield 3 g dihydrocodeinone.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
        <p>6 grams codeine freebase was dissolved in a solution of 4 grams of 
          tartaric acid in 50 ml of water, and 6 grams palladium black was added. 
          The solution was refluxed for 1 hour and worked up as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. 
          Yield 75% of theory.</p>
        <p>Example 6:</p>
        <p> 6 g codeine phosphate was dissolved in 30 ml water, and acidified 
          with 5ml dilute phosphoric acid. 4g of finely divided palladium was 
          added, and the solution was refluxed for one hour. Workup as in <strong>Example 
          1</strong>. Yield 60-70%.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 7:</strong></p>
        <p> 6 grams of codeine free base was dissolved in dilute acetic acid, 
          and was refluxed for two hours after the addition of 5 grams palladium 
          black. After workup as in <strong>Example 1</strong>, the yield was 40% of theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 8: </strong></p>
        <p>21 grams of codeine free base was dissolved in an excess of dilute 
          sulfuric acid, mixed with 16 grams palladium black and refluxed for 
          one hour. After workup as in <strong>Example 1</strong>, the yield was 80-85% of theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 9:</strong></p>
        <p>10 grams of ethylmorphine was mixed with 50 ml water and acidified with 
          HCl. 10 grams of platinum black was added and the mixture was refluxed. 
          The yield of ethyldihydromorphinone was 65-75% of theory.</p>

        <h3>Procedure for the Production of Dihydromorphinones<a href="dihydromorphinones.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>
        <p>As in <a href="dihydromorphinones.html#DE607931">German Patent 607,931</a>, a method is decribed below for the production 
          of dihydromorphinones by rearrangement without the use of hydrogen, 
          but simply by heating the alkaloid in an acidic solution together with 
          a platinum catalyst.</p>
        <p>While relatively large amounts of platinum catalyst 
          is used in <a href="dihydromorphinones.html#DE607931">German Patent 607,931</a>, we have found that only a fraction of that amount is needed, 
          and sometimes with even better yields.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p> 300g codeine freebase was dissolved in 2000ml dilute HCl, and was 
          heated with 25g of finely powdered palladium, and boiled under reflux 
          for an hour. The palladium was filtered off, and the filtrate basified 
          with NaOH solution. The precipitated base was recrystallized from alcohol. 
          Yield 85-95% of dihydrocodeinone, mp 195&deg;C.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
        <p> 5 grams of codeine hydrochloride was dissolved in 30ml water, and 
          acifified with a small amount of HCl, and after the addition of 0.5g 
          of palladium black, the mixture was refluxed for five hours, and worked 
          up as in example 1. The yield was 70% of theoretical.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
        <p> 5 grams of morphine hydrochloride was dissolved in a slightly acid 
          HCl solution, and after the addition of 0.5g palladium black, the mixture 
          was refluxed for three hours and worked up as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. The yield 
          was 3g.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
        <p> 6 grams of codeine freebase was dissolved in 30ml water together with 
          4g of tartaric acid, and 0.5g of palladium black was added. The mixture 
          was refluxed for one hour and worked up as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. The yield was 
          75% of theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
        <p>6 grams of codeine phosphate was dissolved in 30ml water, and acidified 
          with 5ml dilute phosphoric acid, and after the addition of 0.5g of palladium 
          black, the solution was refluxed for an hour. After workup as in <strong>Example 
          1</strong>, 60-70% yield of dihydrocodeinone was isolated.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 6: </strong></p>
        <p>21 grams of codeine freebase was dissolved in an excess of dilute sulfuric acid, 
          and two grams of palladium black was added and the solution refluxed 
          for one hour. The yield was 90% of theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 7: </strong></p>
        <p>10 grams of ethylmorphine freebase was added to 50ml water, and HCl 
          was added until the solution was slightly acidic and all ethylmorphine 
          had dissolved. 1 gram palladium black was added, and the solution was 
          boiled under reflux. The mixture was worked up as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. The 
          yield of ethyldihydromorphinone was 75% of theory.</p>

        <p>While the rearrangement in <a href="dihydromorphinones.html#DE617238">German Patent 617,238</a> is affected by the presence 
          of acids, we have now found that the reaction with morphine and its 
          ethers is taking place in an alcoholic solution in good yields without 
          the addition of any acid.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p> 5 grams morphine was dissolved in 50 ml of alcohol and after the addition 
          of 0.5g of palladium black, the mixture was refluxed for 4 hours. After 
          the catalyst wass filtered off and the solution concentrated, dihydromorphinone 
          crystallized. Yield 3 grams.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2: </strong></p>
        <p>10 grams of codeine was dissolved in 100ml alcohol, and after the addition 
          of 0.5 grams palladium black the solution was refluxed for 4 hours. 
          Workup as in <strong>Example 1</strong>. Yield 7 grams of dihydrocodeinone.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3: </strong></p>
        <p>5 g ethylmorphine and 0.3g of palladium black was dissolved in alcohol 
          and the solution was refluxed. Yield 3g of ethyldihydromorphinone.</p></div>
