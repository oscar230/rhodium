        <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p> Syringaldehyde has been prepared by the oxidation of 
            eucalypt lignin with nitrobenzene and alkali. It has been methylated 
            with dimethyl sulphate and mescaline has been synthesised from the 
            3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde so formed.</p>
          <p> Mescaline, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine (<strong>IV</strong>), the 
            hallucinatory principle of "pellote", was isolated in 1896 by Heffter<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>, and its chemistry has been studied in detail. Numerous syntheses 
            have been developed<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>  and many of these utilised 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic 
            acid or one of its derivatives as starting material. Other synthetic 
            routes made use of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>II</strong>), and Slotta and 
            Heller<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> and Slotta<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> prepared their starting material, 
            trimethoxyphenylpropionic acid, by condensation of the substituted 
            benzaldehyde with malonic acid and reduction of the resulting cinnamic 
            acid. Mescaline was then obtained by Hofmann degradation of the trimethoxyphenylpropionamide.</p>
          <p> Slotta and Szyska<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>9,10</sup></a> obtained mescaline directly 
            by condensing <strong>II</strong> with nitromethane and reducing electrolytically the 
            &omega;-nitro-trimethoxystyrene (<strong>V</strong>). The latter also has been reduced with 
            lithium aluminium hydride<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. Pure crystalline mescaline has also been synthesised 
            by condensation of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde with potassium cyanide 
            followed by acetylation and catalytic reduction to the amine<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
          <p> Syringaldehyde, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde 
            (<strong>I</strong>), is an attractive alternative starting material. D.E. Bland and coworkers<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> reported its preparation by the oxidation of certain 
            eucalypt lignins with nitrobenzene and alkali. Working on a small 
            scale they showed that <em>Eucalyptus regnans</em> (Mountain Ash), <em>E. obliqiia</em>            (Messmate Stringybark) and <em>E. diversicolor</em> (Karri) gave better than 
            5% yields of syringaldehyde. It was decided, therefore, to 
            study the preparation of mescaline from these three species.</p>
          <p> The first stage is the methylation of the free phenolic 
            group of syringaldehyde which can be accomplished either with dimethyl 
            sulphate and alkali, or with diazomethane. Only the first method was 
            examined in detail, since diazomethane would not be favoured as a 
            large-scale reagent. Both the electrolytic and the lithium aluminium 
            hydride reduction of <strong>V</strong> present difficulties on a large scale, especially 
            in the decomposition of the lithium-alanate complex. On the other 
            hand, cyanohydrin formation can be performed quite readily by the 
            reaction of potassium cyanide with the aldehyde bisulphite compound, 
            and catalytic reduction of <strong>III</strong> is straight-forward and cheaper. This 
            route was therefore preferred.</p>
          <br><h3>Procedure</h3>
          <p>75 g portions of air-dry sawdust from kiln-dried timber 
            were oxidised with nitrobenzene and alkali at 150&deg;C according 
            to the method of Bland<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. The mean yield of syringaldehyde from 
            <em>E. regnans</em> was 4.9%, from <em>E. obliqua</em> 3.1% and from <em>E. diversicolor</em>            3.2%. The use of a mechanical stirrer in the autoclave would probably 
            have increased the yields, which may also depend on the particle size 
            of the sawdust.</p>
          <p> 75 of sawdust gave the largest volume of solution which 
            could be extracted conveniently by hand. For larger volumes, a continuous 
            extractor was used in which hot benzene was allowed to flow through 
            the aqueous phase, but during the long period in which the benzene 
            extract was kept at 80&deg;C, a large proportion of the he syringaldehyde 
            decomposed. For large-scale Operation, the benzene extract would have 
            to be kept at a lower temperature by the use of a climbing film or 
            flash evaporator.</p>
          <p> The crude extract which contained both syringaldehyde 
            and vanillin was analysed using a mass spectrometer. since spectrophotometric 
            analyses are of little use in distinguishing these two compounds. 
            The syringealdehyde was separated by fractional recrystallization 
            from benzene until its mass spectrum, compared with that of a mixture 
            of syringaldehyde and vanillin in known proportions, showed it to 
            be at least 95% pure.</p>
          <p> At first syringaldehyde was methylated with dimethyl 
            sulphate for one hour at 0-50&deg;C, giving yields of 42%. It was 
            found that heating at 70°C for a further hour increased the yield of 
            3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde to 56%. Heating above these temperatures 
            lowered the yield, probably because of a Canizzaro reaction. 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde 
            cyanohydrin was prepared from 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde according 
            to the method of Kindler and Peschke<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> using the bisulphite compound 
            as an intermediate. This method eliminates the use of gaseous hydrogen 
            cyanide and is considerably safer. 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin 
            acetate was prepared by refluxing the cyanohydrin with acetic anhydride.</p>

<img src="pictures/mescalyptus.gif" width="541" height="227"></div>			
			
          <p> It has been reported<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> that 
            if the cyanohydrin acetate could be reduced catalytically in glacial 
            acetic acid using palladium black as the catalyst. However, when this 
            system was used, no mescaline was formed. Examination of the reaction 
            mixture with a mass spectrometer indicated that the active palladium 
            black had removed boda acetyl and cyanide groups from the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde 
            cyanohydrin acetate. The reduction was successful using a less active 
            palladium black and absolute ethanol as solvent. Mescaline was finally 
            isolated as the sulphate.</p>
          <p> Based on the weight of kiln-dried wood, the overall 
            yields were 1% for <em>E. Tegnans</em> and 0.7% for the other two species. 
            As the synthetic route is comparatively simple, it would appear that 
            eucalypt sawdust can be used for the economic production of mescaline 
            on a large scale.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>        
          <p><b>3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde</b></p>
          <p> Air-dry sawdust (75 g) of the species tinder investigation, 
            nitrobenzene (45 ml) and sodium hydroxide solution (d 1.51, 2N) were 
            added to an autoclave of 2 L capacity. The bomb was sealed, shaken 
            vigorously for a few seconds and then agitated for 3 hours at 150&deg;C. 
            After cooling, the reaction mixture from the oxidation was filtered 
            and the residue washed twice with distilled water (100 ml). The filtrate 
            and washings were extracted with benzene to remove nitrobenzene and 
            its reduction products; the aqueous solution was made acid with a 
            10% excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid and was allowed to stand 
            for 24 hours. It was then filtered to remove the precipitate which 
            had formed.</p>
          <p>The clear filtrate was extracted with benzene, and the 
            combined benzene washings were concentrated to a convenient volume 
            (50 ml). This concentrate was extracted with sodium bisulphite solution 
            (20%) until no more aldehyde could be detected in the washings 
            by acidifying, boiling off the sulphur dioxide, and testing with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine 
            in hydrochloric acid (2N). The combined bisulphite washings were acidified 
            with conc. hydrochloric acid and the sulphur dioxide removed by heating 
            in a current of nitrogen; they were then extracted with benzene until 
            free from aldehyde. The benzene extracts were evaporated to dryness, 
            and then recrystallised from hot benzene. A second recrystallisation 
            from hot water gave syringaldehyde; m.p. 111&deg;C.</p>
          <p><b>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde</b></p>



          <p>Syringaldehyde (10 g) was dissolved with gentle heating 
            in a solution of sodium hydroxide (3 g) in water (100 ml), and the 
            mixture was then cooled below 50&deg;C in an ice-bath. Dimethyl sulphate 
            (6 ml) was added dropwise with vigorous mechanical stirring during 
            one hour, the temperature being kept below 50&deg;C. The mixture was then 
            heated for one hour in a water bath at 70&deg;C, and was cooled and extracted 
            twice with benzene (100 ml). The benzene was evaporated and the residue 
            was extracted with sodium bisulphite solution (20%) . After 
            filtration, the aqueous extract was acidified and the sulphur dioxide 
            was removed by warming in a current of nitrogen. The aldehyde was 
            extracted with benzene and recrystallised from aqueous ethanol. Yield, 
            6.0 g (56%); mp 70-71&deg;C.</p>
          <p><b>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde Cyanohydrin</b></p>



          <p>Trimethoxybenzaldehyde (8.8 g) was dissolved with gentle 
            warming in saturated sodium bisulphite solution (20 ml). The resulting 
            mixture was allowed to reach room temperature, when the precipitated 
            bisulphite compound was removed by filtration and washed with absolute 
            ethanol. The bisulphite compound was dissolved in water (10 ml) and 
            a solution of potassium cyanide (6 g) in water (10 ml) was gradually 
            added. The resulting oil solidified on cooling, was collected by filtration, 
            washed first with bisulphite solution, then with water, and was finally 
            dried over phosphorus pentoxide. Yield, 9.7g (96%); mp 81-82&deg;C.</p>
          <p><b>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde Cyanohydrin Acetate</b></p>
		  

          <p>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin (10 g) was 
            refluxed with acetic anhydride (50 ml) for 2 hours. Excess anhydride 
            was removed by distillation under reduced pressure; the residue was 
            taken up in ether and the ether solution was washed with sodium carbonate 
            solution (10%), sodium bisulphite solution (20%) and 
            water. The solution was then dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate 
            and the residue from the dried ether distilled at 165-170&deg;C (0.1 mm). 
            Yield, 8.2 g (69%).</p>
          <p> <b>3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenethylamine</b></p>
		  
		  
          <p>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin acetate (1 
            g) was dissolved in ethanol (15 ml) and concentrated sulphuric acid 
            (0.4 ml) and palladium black (140 mg) were added. The reduction was 
            performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and was discontinued 
            after 95% of the calculated amount of hydrogen had been absorbed. 
            The ethanol was eliminated and the residue was taken up in water. 
            After filtration and extraction with ether, the aqueous solution was 
            evaporated. The mescaline was isolated as the sulphate and was recrystallised 
            from water. Yield, 0.5 g (50%), mp 181-184&deg;C; lit. 183-186&deg;C<a href="mescalyptus.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
