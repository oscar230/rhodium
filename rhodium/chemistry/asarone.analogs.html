<p>There slowly and simultaneously was added 7.7 g dimethyl sulfate (0.061 mol) and aqueous NaOH (2.44 g NaOH in
10 mL water) to 10 g eugenol <b>(10)</b> (0.061 mol), which was warmed up to 60°C. Care should be taken that
the reaction mixture does not exceed 60°C. The mixture is stirred for another hour, after which the oleaginous
phase separated. It yielded, after distillation, 9.55 g (88%) <b>11</b>; bp 151-153°C/37 mmHg (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a> bp 125°C/14 mmHg).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4,5-Dimethoxy-2-(2-propenyl)nitrobenzene <b>(12)</b></h4>

<p>A mixture of 6.05 g (0.034 mol) of <b>11</b> and 25.4 g (0.423 mol) of GAA was cooled down to 5°C, after which
there was added 4 mL (0.1 mol) concentrated nitric acid drop by drop. The mixture was stirred at the same
temperature for another 20 min. It was subsequently poured on ice, which resulted in the precipitation of a
yellow substance. It was filtered and washed with water (3 x 5 mL), dried <i>in vacuo</i> and recrystallized
from hexane, yielding 5.46 g (72%) of <b>12</b> as yellow needle-shaped crystals; mp 41-42°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a> mp 44°C).</p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>)-4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-propenyl)nitrobenzene <b>(3a)</b></h4>

<p>Metallic sodium (1.5 g, 0.065 mol) was dissolved in 100 mL anhydrous MeOH. Subsequently, 10 g (0.045 mol) of
<b>12</b> was added, after which the reaction mixture was stirred for another 8 h at 25°C. The precipitated
product was removed <i>via</i> vacuum filtration and recrystallized from hexane, yielding 9.2 g (92%) of
<b>3a</b> as yellow crystals.</p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>)-1-Amino-4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-propenyl)benzene <b>(3b)</b></h4>

<p>3.0 g (13.4 mmol) of <b>3a</b> was dissolved in boiling MeOH, after which a solution of 10 g (0.057 mol)
NaHSO<sub>3</sub> in 50 mL was added. This mixture was refluxed for 4 h. The solvent was evaporated and the
residue taken up into 100 mL MeOH and boiled for 5 mins. Insoluble salts were removed by filtration, while the
filtrate was concentrated <i>in vacuo</i> and recrystallized from ethyl acetate, yielding 2.15 g (83%) of
<b>3b</b> as orange crystals that darken under the influence of light; mp 93-94°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> mp 94-96°C).</p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>)-1-Amino-4,5-dimethoxy-2-(2-propenyl)benzene <b>(13)</b></h4>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/asarone.12-15.gif" width="489" height="151">
</div>

<p>To a solution of 1.0 g (4.48 mmol) of <b>12</b> in 13 mL MeOH (at room temperature), there was slowly added a
solution of 14.0 g NaHSO<sub>3</sub> in 50 mL of water. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for another 8 hr. The
suspension was filtered and the solids washed with 150 mL MeOH. The filtrates were combined and the solvent
evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified <i>via</i> column chromatography (20 g silica gel,
hexane/ethyl acetate 9:1), yielding 0.57 g (66%) of <b>13</b> as a coffee-coloured viscous liquid.</p>

<h4>1-Acetamido-4,5-dimethoxy-2-(2-propenyl)benzene <b>(14)</b></h4>

<p>A mixture of 0.1 g (0.52 mmol) of <b>13</b> and 0.5 mL (5.3 mmol) acetic anhydride was stirred at ambient
temperature for 5 h. There subsequently was added 10 mL of water, after which the mixture was extracted with
DCM (3 x 20 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent stripped off under
reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of water/MeOH (3:2, 25 mL), decolourized with
charcoal and filtered. The filtrate was extracted with DCM (3 x 30 mL) and the organic phase dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate. This yielded 0.109 g (90%) of <b>14</b> as clear coffee-coloured crystals after
evaporation of the solvent; mp 122-123°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a> 126-127°C).</p>

<h4>5,6-Dimethoxy-2-methylindole <b>(15)</b></h4>

<p>A suspension of 0.26 g PdCl<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)<sub>2</sub> (0.1 mmol) in dry THF (3.5 mL) was
prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, after which 0.1 g
dry triethylamine (0.99 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture stirred for a further 1.5 h. There were two
more additions of triethylamine (0.1 g, 0.99 mmol) followed by stirring at 25°C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the
mixture was filtered and the filtrate reduced in volume under reduced pressure. The residue was purified
<i>via</i> column chromatography (30 g silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate 9:1), yielding 0.067 g (35%) of
<b>15</b> as yellow crystals; mp 86-87°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> 88-89°C).</p>

<h4>1,2,4-Triacetoxybenzene <b>(20)</b></h4>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/asarone.19-20-21-16a-1-2.gif" width="389" height="251">
</div>

<p>To a mixture of 12 g (0.12 mol) concentrated sulfuric acid and 180 g (1.76 mol) acetic anhydride, there was
added <b>19</b> (60 g, 0.55 mol) in small portions and with vigorous stirring. The temperature is increased
and should be maintained between 40-50°C till the end of the reaction. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool
down to room temperature, after which it is poured in 750 mL cold water. The mixture is cooled down to 10°C
and the white precipitate is filtered off. This yields 117.6 g (84%) of <b>20</b> as white crystals after
recrystallization from EtOH and drying <i>in vacuo</i>; mp 96-97°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>24</sup></a> 96-97°C).</p>

<h4>1,2,4-Trimethoxybenzene <b>(21)</b></h4>

<p>To a mixture of 28.5 mL (38 g, 0.3 mol) dimethyl sulfate and 40 mL MeOH, there was added 25.2 g (0.1 mol) of
<b>20</b>. Vacuum was applied (30 mmHg) and the reaction mixture temperature cooled down to 5°C. Aqueous NaOH
(24 g NaOH in 50 mL water) was added to the mixture while the reaction mixture temperature did not exceed
20°C. When all solution was added, the vacuum was relieved and the mixture warmed to 60°C for 1h after which
the reaction was allowed to rest for another 12 h. Two phases were formed upon the addition of 50 mL water.
The mixture was extracted with ether (3 x 50 mL) and the organic phase dried over anhydrour sodium sulfate.
Evaporation of the solvent yielded a residue, which on distillation under reduced pressure gave 10.51 g (62%)
of <b>21</b>; bp 115-120°C/5 mmHg.</p>

<h4>Asaraldehyde <b>(16a)</b></h4>

<p>To a precooled mixture of  POCl<sub>3</sub> (12 mL, 18.39 g, 0.12 mol) and dry DMF (11 mL), there was slowly
added a solution of 20 g <b>21</b> (0.12 mol) in 4 mL DMF. The mixture was stirred and cooled on an ice bath
during the addiction. Subsequently, the mixture was warmed to 95°C during 4.5 h. It was then cooled down to
25°C and added to 100 mL of an ethyl acetate/water mixture. This caused a creamy coloured precipitate to fall
out, which was filtered and recrystallized from EtOH to yield 11.9 g (51%) of <b>16a</b> as white crystals; mp
112-113°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>25</sup></a> 114°C).</p>

<h4>(<i>Z</i>)-1,2,4-trimethoxy-5-(1-propenyl)benzene <b>(2)</b></h4>

<p>A 25 mL glass recipient sealed with a septum was charged with 0.177 g (5.5 mmol) NaH (75% solution), which was
washed with 2 x 2 mL hexane. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 2.7 mL DMSO was introduced and the suspension warmed
up to 80°C for 45 min with vigorous stirring. At 0°C, there was added 1.52 g (4.15 mmol) of
ethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in 4.2 mL DMSO and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 40 min. There
subsequently was added at 25°C 0.12 g (0.61 mmol) of <b>16a</b> and the mixture stirred for 2 days. The
solution was whased with brine (25 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 15 mL). the organic phase was
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent evaporated <i>in vacuo</i>. The residue was purified by
column chromatography (30 g Florisil, hexane/ethyl acetate 8:2), yielding 0.018 g (14%) of a mixture of
<b>1</b>/<b>2</b> (52:48) as a coffee-coloured oil.</p>

<h4>Veratraldehyde <b>(23)</b></h4>

<p>To a boiling solution of 182 g (1.2 mol) of <b>22</b> in 450 mL water, there was added preheated aqueous NaOH
(72 g NaOH in 360 mL water). The mixture was heated and 189 g (1.5 mol) dimethyl sulfate was drop-wise added.
The mixture was further warmed for 45 min and another 39 g (30 mL, 0.31 mol) dimethyl sulfate was added. After
10 min, there was successively added aqueous NaOH (12 g NaOH in 60 mL water) and 30 mL dimethyl sulfate. This
was repeated twice, finally followed by the addition of 75 g NaOH in 150 mL water. The reaction mixture is
warmed for an additional 20 min and allowed to cool down to 25°C, after which is extracted with ether (3 x 50
mL). The combined ether extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent removed <i>in
vacuo</i>, yielding a dense oil that is further purified by distillation. This gave 181.49 g (91%, lit
<sup>19</sup> 82-87%) of <b>23</b> (bp 153°C/8 mmHg) as a white solid; mp 45-46°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a> 45-46°C).</p>

<h4>6-Nitroveratraldehyde <b>(16b)</b></h4>

<p>A 1 L glass recipient covered with aluminium foil was charged with 350 mL (7.77 mol) HNO<sub>3</sub> and
brought to a temperature of 15°C (water bath) (careful! <b>16b</b> is photosensitive). Subsequently, there
slowly was added 70 g (0.42 mol) of finely crushed <b>23</b>, care being taken that the temperature remained
18-22°C. The mixture was stirred for 10 min and poured in a glass recipient containing 4 L of water under
vigorous stirring. After 15 min, a precipitate started to fall out which was filtered in the absence of light,
and washed with cold water (2 L). It was dried at ambient temperature and protected from light for 15 days.
The solid substance is recrystallized twice from EtOH, yielding 56.94 g (64%) of <b>16b</b>; mp 129-131°C (lit<a href="asarone.analogs.html#refs"><sup>26</sup></a> 129-131°C).</p>
