<h1>Simple Glass to Fancy Glass</h1>

<p>
I had some homework to do, so I was playing with Paintshop Pro instead. Here are some pics I made for you bees with fancy needs, but only simple glass. The first pic is just a numbered list of some simple pieces of glass that can usually be found without resorting to a chem-glass supplier (except maybe for my favorite piece, #7, the double-ended dildo for glassware! ). Sorry if the resolution on the first figure is kind of sucky, I had to shrink it to make sure it would fit on everyone's screen without making them scroll sideways.
<br><br>
Assembling more complex apparati from smaller units is advantageous for many reasons including:
<ul>
<li>It is cheaper
<li>Fewer total glass items cuts down on bulky storage space
<li>Apparati are often more adaptable to a given situation
<li>Replacing a broken component is cheaper and easier than replacing or repairing an entire apparatus
</ul>

<br><br>
Oh, and one more thing, you should always put hose clamps on the hose connections. I didn't bother drawing them in though.

<b>Pressure equalized addition funnel:</b>
<br><br>
A pressure equalized addition funnel can be make by assembling the components as seen in figure 2.

<b>Dean-Stark receiver:</b>
<br><br>
Dean-Stark receivers are useful for removing water (or other species) from a reaction via azeotropic distillation while returning the reaction solvent to the flask. Construction of one is diagrammed in figure 3.

<b>Fraction receiver</b>
<br><br>
Fraction receivers are <i>very</i> handy pieces of equipment to have when performing fractional distillations. They allow the changing of the receiving flask without interrupting the distillation (i.e. without releasing vacuum). Figure 4 shows how one can be built.

Figure 5 shows the operation of the fraction receiver. When you have distillate coming over (collecting a fraction), you will want to have stopcock #1 open (so that the distillate falls into the receiving flask), and stopcock #2 open (so vacuum is maintained in the entire system.
<br><br>
When the first fraction stops coming over, and the second starts to, you should close #1 (the distillate will stay in the funnel), and close #2 (so that the vacuum is released in the receiving flask). Remove your receiving flask, pour it out into an appropriate container, clean quickly, then re-attach it. Then <i>slowly</i> open #2 to pull a vacuum in the receiving flask, but do it slowly so that the vacuum in the rest of the system is not disturbed too much.
<br><br>
Once #2 is all the way open, and the receiving flask evacuated, open #1 to let the next fraction go into the receiving flask.
<br><br>
And repeat as needed.
