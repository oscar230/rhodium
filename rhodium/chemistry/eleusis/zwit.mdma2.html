        <p>So you thumb through PiHKAL and stop at synth. 109. Say, it looks so 
          nice, you decide to give it a whirl. Of course, you have already taken 
          your licks learning the chemistry and lab technique, so all that's stopping 
          you is the sheer tedium of the process.</p>
        <p>[exit blithering, aimless, Tom Robbins mode]</p>
        <p>Alright, today's infomercial-quality post concerns a tricky modification 
          to the work-up of MDMA oil from what The Good Doctor does in PiHKAL.</p>
        <p>Old ZWITTERION has had his nose to the grindstone pondering a way to 
          pump up yield while preserving pristine purity in the product - because 
          the only thing more important than a good yield to ZWIT, is a pure yield 
          (of course, the two go hand in hand at the top end of percent yields).</p>
        <p>What I wished to accomplish specifically was a way to go from the crude 
          freebase oil/salt mixture which results from stripping the solvents 
          off under vacuum, to the HCl salt of MDMA without all that washing, 
          extracting and extraneous crap. Even more specifically, I wanted to 
          kill that god-awful step where you pour the freebase oil/salt mix into 
          2 liters of water, convert to the salt, then wash, etc... That step 
          is an OBVIOUS killer on yield, and there are such better ways to get 
          rid of the major impurity, which happens to be the DIMER of MDMA.</p>
        <p>Now, at first the obvious route was considered, tried, and found good 
          success with. What's the obvious route? Washing the freebase oil/salt 
          mixture with water to get rid of the salt, then dumping the oil into 
          ether and bubbling HCl gas through it. This gave an exceptional yield 
          of nice white crystals which cleaned up exceedingly well with Acetone.</p>
        <p>Yes, Acetone. If you are getting brownish crystals, better wash with 
          Acetone to get them sparkling clean. Pure MDMA HCl is negligibly soluble 
          in it, so all your loss will be impotent contaminants (in other words, 
          don't whine when 20% of your "product" gets washed away as you're product 
          was only 80% pure).</p>
        <p>However, the downside to this process is that it wastes a lot of ether, 
          actually takes LONGER to do than the conventional washing, and LOTS 
          of HCl gas is required (read that as: you need a good fume hood, and 
          preferably one that doesn't vent into an apartment complex!).</p>
        <p>What's the alternative ZWIT came up with? The natural synthesis of 
          Shulgin's ways and the HCl Bubbling way.</p>
        <p>Once you strip off all of the alcohol and amine under vacuum - BTW, 
          it is NOT necessary to strip off the remaining water from the oil/salt 
          mix - wash the two-phase mixture with an equal volume of water to rid 
          the oil of salt. Back extract the wash water with methylene chloride 
          to get any carried over MDMA oil, then combine the back extract with 
          the washed freebase oil. Strip off the methylene chloride under vacuum, 
          then add the crude oil to twice it's volume of 91% (or anhydrous) isopropyl 
          alcohol. Then add enough concentrated HCl until pH is less than 2. Pour 
          the solution out in a thin pool on glass or ceramic plates and heat 
          on a steam bath (use a large boiling pot on the stove with about 1" 
          of water in it) for about 10 minutes each plate. Set the plates aside 
          to cool, and once at room temperature, you should at least see sparse 
          crystallization occuring. Don't worry - all you have to do is start 
          scraping the oil around the plate, with some healthy chopping motions 
          here and there (called "triturating" it) and crystals will spring to 
          life.</p>
        <p>Scrape all the crystals into a suitable glass or plastic container 
          and then cover with about twice the volume of Acetone. Swirl, stir and 
          chop well, then decant off the Acetone. Repeat with one more wash, then 
          spread the raw crystals out to dry on a plate. Steam may be used once 
          again to increase the speed. Once all dry, scrape, chop with a razor 
          blade, and weigh. </p>
        <p>I have found that one normally gets an amount of MDMA*HCl in grams 
          equal to or slightly greater than the amount of MDP-2-P used in the 
          first place. This is much more inline with what I would expect out of 
          an Al-Hg reductive amination.</p>
        <p>Also, speaking of Al-Hg aminations, try conducting your next one in 
          a large Erlenmeyer flask with a stopper in the neck. Run a tube from 
          the stopper into a beaker of dilute HCl to catch methylamine which boils 
          off of the reaction. Then, after several runs, you can evap. the dilute 
          HCl to yield recovered methylamine HCl, as well as totally killing the 
          intense ammonia smell the reaction will otherwise infuse your immediate 
          living space with.</p>
