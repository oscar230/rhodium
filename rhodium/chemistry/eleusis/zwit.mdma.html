        <p>This text describes the complete process of making MDMA starting from 
          the essential oil extracted from Ocotea Cymabrum (Brazilian Sassafras). 
          ZWITTERION wished me to put his observations into a more fluid and correct 
          form for "reference" use, so I am obliging. He gave me free license 
          to edit where necessary, but I will tend to keep modifications offset 
          by brackets [E - ] to indicate my intrusions, with the exception of 
          spelling/grammar mistakes, which will not be offset. For humor purposes 
          I will also leave most of his rants and raves in. Also, this is *not* 
          a step-by-step synthesis, but the observation of following previously 
          published syntheses. Those syntheses are from the sources:</p>

        <p>Well, old ZWITTERION is back! Just when you thought it was safe to 
          post STUPIDITY, I've come to PROVIDE THE EMPIRICAL DATA you sleazy little 
          chemical WHORES love so much.</p>
        <p><b>*Part 1 - Isomerization of Safrole*</b></p>
        <p>Today's topic is: Isomerization of Safrole <br>
          Today's victim is: Eleusis</p>
        <p>Old ZWITTERION, feeling especially felonious this weekend, decided 
          to START A THREE-ALARM FIRE, and felt that there would be NO better 
          way to do this than to isomerize some safrole.</p>
        <p>Now, as eleusis has posted, one heats up safrole to 244C, which technically 
          ain't gonna happen, with some KOH and CaO. Well, funny thing is, it 
          does happen, and pretty much like he says it will.</p>
        <p>One BIG FUCKING PROBLEM, Mr. Eleusis (who is no doubt yukking it up 
          in some bizarre spring mystery ceremony when he writes these things) 
          and that is...</p>
        <p>FIRE!</p>
        <p>Mr. E, coy as usual, says heat the safrole to 244C. Well, he originally 
          didn't specify how one would do this, assuming, probably, that we all 
          have nice EXPENSIVE Thermowell (TM) brand heating mantles, or Dow-Corning 
          (TM) magnetic stirrer hotplates. Only in your WET DREAMS, E - buddy.</p>
        <p><i>[E - a glass-fiber heating mantle is ideal for this process]</i></p>
        <p>Though, maybe you SHOULD if you want to do this. Alright. Good enough 
          point.</p>
        <p>Still, this is what old ZWITTERION did:</p>
        <p>First ZWITTERION used good old Discount Auto Parts 20W-50 motor oil 
          (because, like the Infamous Wet Dreamer sez - "today's flasks run hotter 
          and rev higher" - funny, funny).</p>
        <p>Immense smoking commenced at 150C with no sign of letting up! ZWITTERION 
          abandoned this as a suitable heating bath fluid.</p>
        <p>Next, ZWITTERION sees Eleusis's repost with "gulf wax paraffin" slid 
          in for the heating bath.</p>
        <p>So, ZWITTERION fires up the old Buffet Burner and throws in 1.5 boxes 
          of Gulf Wax (TM) paraffin. Smoking starts at about 200C this time, but 
          it does make it to 250C. Unfortunately, the way ZWITTERION tested the 
          temperature at 250C was by wrapping a thermometer in Aluminum Foil so 
          that it would be easy to clean. BOOM!</p>
        <p><i>[E - a buffet burner is a single coil burner, ~$15]</i></p>
        <p>When that Aluminum foil hit the paraffin it went up like a FUCKING 
          FOURTH OF JULY EXTRAVAGANZA.</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION burned up a nice chem. catalog smothering that one.</p>
        <p>Finally, after e-mailing Eleusis, who was no doubt feverishly masturbating 
          to the sight of his chemical supply cabinet at the time, he said to 
          use DOT 5 Brake Fluid, as that is what someone else had suggested to 
          him.</p>
        <p>So, feeling SAUCY, ZWITTERION fired up the buffet burner for a THIRD 
          time and VOI-FREAKIN'-LLA. It works.</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION wrapped the heating pot and flask, supported on a lattice, 
          with aluminum foil. This was to help keep the heat constant and reduce 
          the smoking, which, MIGHT I ADD, the brake fluid smokes as well, and 
          is a nasty, eye-burning smoke TOO!</p>
        <p>Once the brake fluid hit 250C, tested WITHOUT wrapping the thermometer 
          in foil, ZWITTERION then added 100g of Oil of Ocotea Cymbarum to which 
          had already been added the required amounts of calcium oxide and potassium 
          hyroxide.</p>
        <p><i>[E - it is improper to add the bases before heating, but apparently 
          it worked]</i></p>
        <p>ZWITTERION plugged the RB flask with a thermometer in a thermometer 
          adapter, and watched the temp climb, just as Eleusis says it should, 
          from 232C to 250C over a period of 15 minutes.</p>
        <p><i>[E - it is dangerous to plug the flask, better to allow some means 
          of venting so that pressure does not build up]</i></p>
        <p>At the expiration time, ZWITTERION noticed that the oil was a slightly 
          darker brownish red color instead of the golden piss-yellow color that 
          it started as. It was vacuum filtered, to little advantage, and then 
          OOPS washed with water first - WHICH IS NOT WHAT eleusis SAYS TO DO.</p>
        <p><i>[E - it is best to let the post-isomerization mixture settle in 
          a beaker for several hours, then decant off as much of the liquid layer 
          for final distillation]</i></p>
        <p>A VICIOUS emulsion formed which was only satisfactorily broken by adding 
          a lot of salt and 10% HCl.</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION then drew off the aq. layer and the organic layer, and washed 
          the organic layer with 5% HCl one more time before distilling ISOSAFROLE 
          over the range 250-255C (ZWITTERION's thermometer ain't 100% accurate, 
          BTW). Yield was, oh, maybe 85%.</p>
        <p>All in all, not a bad day's work.</p>
        <p>[snip]</p>
        <p><b>*Part 2 - Purification of the crude Isosafrole*</b></p>
        <p>Here's the followups to the fuckups, plus some NEW data all will be 
          sure to LOVE.</p>
        <p>On Isosafrole:</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION broke down and bought a goddamn HEATING MANTLE as a result 
          of the brake fluid nonsense in isomerizing SAFROLE TO ISOSAFROLE.</p>
        <p>Why didn't someone tell me it'd be the BEST $85.00 I'd ever spend?</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION assembled a fractional distillation setup using the following 
          equipment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>500mL boiling and receiving flasks. 
          <li>10cm Liebig condenser w/ warm water flow. 
          <li>20cm Vigreaux (whatever the fuck you spell it) column. 
          <li>3-way and vacuum receiver adapter (left open). 
        </ul>
        <p>Here's a HOT TIP that eleusis snuck onto a post in a.d.c a while ago 
          which probably NONE of you paid attention to.</p>
        <p>Mount a bilge pump in a 5 gallon paint bucket (TAKE THE PAINT OUT, 
          GODDAMNIT!) with hoses leading to your condenser. Run the pump off a 
          12volt power supply (can you say BATTERY CHARGER?) and VOI-FREAKIN'-LLA, 
          you have a self-contained cooling system without the need for a SINK!</p>
        <p>Not to mention, you can charge the bucket with hot water for high temperature 
          condensations, like ISOSAFROLE, or ice water for ETHER RECOVERY (an 
          all-time favorite thing for ZWITTERION to do while smoking a 6 foot 
          water bong).</p>
        <p><i>[E - need I mention that incendiary substances of any form do not 
          mix well with volatile solvents?]</i></p>
        <p>Now, where were we?</p>
        <p>OH YES.</p>
        <p>So, ZWITTERION took the dark-red product which resulted from the ISOMERIZATION 
          of OIL of OCOTEA CYMBARUM and fractionally distilled it on the heating 
          mantle. There was NO FORERUN. That means NO product came over at a temperature 
          less than ISOSAFROLE's bp of 253C. Approximately 75ml of the crude isosafrole 
          was distilled, with the COLUMN WRAPPED IN ALUMINIUM FOIL to yield 72mL 
          of a CLEAR distillate. There remained in the boiling flask a nasty CRUD 
          which has THUS FAR RESISTED ALL SANE AND INSANE ATTEMPTS AT REMOVAL.</p>
        <p><i>[E - Note, the fact that no forerun came over means that all the 
          safrole was consumed, as it is the lowest boiling fraction in oil of 
          ocotea cymbarum. Furthermore, it is necessary to wrap the column with 
          Al foil to prevent excessive heat loss which would otherwise make distillation 
          impossibly long. Finally, drop the heating mantle away from the flask 
          while still stirring magnetically when several mL's are still left to 
          go so that the crud won't carbonize and then *first* rinse the cooled 
          flask with mineral spirits twice before washing with soap and water.]</i></p>
        <p>Calculated yield, based on amount of oil of ocotea cymbarum, is 80% 
          pure ISOSAFROLE. There was NO decomposition of product noted as a result 
          of distilling at atmospheric pressure, but then again, ZWITTERION didn't 
          exactly run it through a GODDAMN gas chromatograph.</p>
        <p><i>[E - Isosafrole is a clear, somewhat viscous liquid. If it came 
          over clear, as ZWITTERION implies, it likely did not suffer decomposition. 
          The Merck does not indicate that Isosafrole decomposes at it's bp, but 
          no need to take unnecessary chances.]</i></p>
        <p><b>*Part 3 - Conversion of Isosafrole to the ketone intermediate MDP-2-P*</b></p>
        <p>MDP2P is shorthand for 3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone and has 
          the following structure:</p>
        <p><img src="zwit.mdp2p.gif"></p>
        <p>bp(2): 110C; bp(40): 160C; bp(100): 190C</p>
        <p>Due to the RESOUNDING SUCCESS experienced making Isosafrole, ZWITTERION 
          pursued the NEXT STEP, which is to form the ketone, MDP-2-P.</p>
        <p>Now, old ZWITTERION always thought that reacting a peracid with a non-terminal 
          alkene would make an epoxide, and hydrolysis of said epoxide would result 
          in a 1,2-glycol - but then again, ZWITTERION don't know shit.</p>
        <p><i>[E - Under most circumstances, this is correct, but the term is 
          1,2-Diol or just plain Glycol. It is because of the extreme difference 
          in carbocation character on one side of the epoxide to the other that 
          makes a ketone, rather than a symmetrical diol.]</i></p>
        <p>So, ZWITTERION opened up PiHKAL to synthesis #109, courtesy of Dr. 
          Shulgin, and tried to interpret the SPARTAN DETAILS into a workable 
          PROCESS.</p>
        <p>Here is what has happened SO FAR:</p>
        <p>ZWITTERION diluted ~20mL of 50% Hydrogen Peroxide to 32mL of 30% Hydrogen 
          Peroxide with distilled water.</p>
        <p><i>[E - rumor has it that "Wood Bleach Kits", seen at Builder's Square, 
          contain 27% H2O2 which should work fine.]</i></p>
        <p>ZWITTERION poured 133g of 90% Formic Acid into a 500mL RB flask situated 
          in a cold water bath on a magnetic stirrer then added 17mL of distilled 
          water to make 150g of 80% Formic Acid. Is there something fishy with 
          that math? Probably. Fuck it.</p>
        <p><i>[E - the math is fine.]</i></p>
        <p>The 30% H2O2 solution was SLOWLY added to the HCOOH with stirring and 
          allowed to chill for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>32.4g of Isosafrole was dissolved in 120mL of fresh-from-home-despot(c) 
          Acetone (I always like to have a wild-card reagent just for fun) and 
          this was loaded into an addition funnel which was then placed onto the 
          RB flask and allowed to drip at 1 DROP PER SECOND.</p>
        <p>All 120mL was delivered within 2 hours with temp checking every 15 
          minutes to make sure it wasn't getting too HOT. The temp never climbed 
          above 35C as long as ZWITTERION kept adding a few pieces of ice here 
          and there.</p>
        <p><i>[E - the ice is added to the water bath, not to the reaction contents]</i></p>
        <p>The color of the reaction is the KEY OBSERVATION in this process, since 
          these are the ONLY DETAILS Shulgin gives! Here's a list of the observed 
          color changes at various points in the addition:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>~15mL: a slight yellow tinge. 
          <li>~50mL: definitely orangish 
          <li>~100mL: kind of a clear reddish 
          <li>~120mL: looks like transmission fluid; deep red but clear. 
        </ul>
        <p>The solution remained on the stirrer MUCH TO THE DIFFICULTY OF ME TRYING 
          TO SLEEP for an additional 14 hours. The color remained as it did after 
          all was added and the temperature was STABLE the entire time as noted 
          by my DATA LOGGING thermometer.</p>
        <p>In other words: SO FAR, SO GOOD.</p>
        <p>Now the setup was changed to distill on the heating mantle using a 
          cold water condenser and VACUUM from a VACUUM PUMP. Shulgin sez: "distill 
          till ya get about 60g of residue". Whatever that means, so ZWITTERION 
          distills under vacuum (dunno how hard a vacuum, but not out of the reach 
          of a water ass-pirater (c)-POPeye) until he THINKS he has 60g. The temperature 
          started at about 37C and climbed to 45C when I disassembled the setup 
          to weigh the mother liquor. It still had the noxious odor of Formic 
          Acid and when thin was a distinct yellow-red color. The mother liquor 
          weighed 88g so ZWITTERION fired up the distillation again and let the 
          temp reach 53C this time. Upon this second weighing, the mother liquor 
          was much less smelly, but still with a faint odor of HCOOH, and now 
          weighed 44g! GREAT! WHERE DA FUCK did that other 16g go? The distillate 
          was still clear, so I can only assume SOMETHING FISHY happened. Maybe 
          Shulgin just has better lab technique than me?</p>
        <p><i>[E - there is no problem here, the final volume of the mother liquor 
          is not an exact target, as long as it is less than twice the starting 
          isosafrole]</i></p>
        <p>To this was added 50mL of methanol (not 60 because I had 70% of the 
          expected yield) and ~250mL of 15% Sulphuric Acid (41.5g H2SO4 + 233.5mL 
          water). ZWITTERION placed a thermometer & therm. adapter into the flask 
          and heated GENTLY on the mantle to SIMULATE a steam bath, which ZWITTERION 
          has NO INTENTION of ever using! I was shooting for around 80-90C but 
          the temp quickly hit 115C within minutes, so I dropped the heating mantle 
          down from the flask and continued stirring in the free air. When the 
          temp dropped back down to about 80C, the mantle was replaced and set 
          at a lower setting, where it slowly climbed from there to 95C over the 
          next two hours. In the next 15 minutes, though, the temperature began 
          falling, indicating, at least to this old bastard, that the reaction 
          was coming to a PEACEFUL close.</p>
        <p>Less than an hour left, I'll let you know what happens in the next 
          edition.</p>
        <p><b>*Part 4 - Continuation of making MDP-2-P*</b></p>
        <p>Well kids, the ballots are in and all the votes are counted.</p>
        <p>When we last left off, ZWITTERION was still hydrolysing the epoxide 
          using H2SO4 on a "simulated" steam bath. Temperature proved a bit difficult 
          to control, wandering between 80 and 115C. Not exactly sharp lab technique, 
          but THEN AGAIN, ZWIT ain't none for his flashy lab skills. Besides, 
          the more I FUCK up, the better chance YOU have of doing better, right? 
          Right.</p>
        <p>Okay, so the temperature falls in the flask and it's been 3 hours so 
          what the fuck - let's dump this baby into a goddamn beaker and start 
          EXTRACTING. Whoa there! Better chill that shit down first... nothing 
          like having ether contact something that's currently TWICE IT'S BOILING 
          POINT. Yah - That'd be pretty spectacular.</p>
        <p>So ZWIT sets the beaker in ice water while preparing the necessary 
          reagents for all the washes and extractions. After the ketone/acid mix 
          has cooled to about 18C, ZWIT notes the color and appearance. There 
          are two layers present, though not entirely immiscible. A dark, almost 
          black one is on the bottom - the ketone layer, and a translucent reddish-yellow 
          one is on top (the yellow is only apparent near the glass-liquid interfaces, 
          though). ZWIT does the customary three-volumes of ether extraction and 
          combines the extracts, keeping them in the freezer all the while. A 
          total of 225mL of ether is used. ZWIT sets aside the post-extraction 
          aqueous solution JUST IN CASE!</p>
        <p>Next comes the water wash. ZWIT uses CHILLED distilled water in two 
          washes of 100mL each. The wash water looks much like the aqueous post-extraction 
          layer, proving the wash was a neccessary step. NOW COMES THE TRICKY 
          PART!</p>
        <p>The final wash is with 10% Sodium Hydroxide solution, and this one 
          is a BITCH. Why? Because a lot of the black shit goes into the hydroxide 
          layer, MAKING IT INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ORGANIC LAYER! ZWIT does 
          a single wash with 100mL of 10% NaOH, but notices that it would be smarter 
          in the future to do 2 or 3 washes of 50mL each. ZWIT solves the "can't-tell-which" 
          problem by REMEMBERING how much NaOH solution was added and holding 
          the sep funnel IN FRONT OF A WINDOW (bright light kids - works every 
          time).</p>
        <p><i>[E - you definitely want to use a dilute NaOH wash, of larger volume 
          and split into multiple sections, as ZWITTERION suggests he'd do next 
          time]</i></p>
        <p>The organic layer was dumped into a distillation setup and the ether 
          was recovered for reuse using ice water in the condenser flow.</p>
        <p>Now the vacuum pump is connected and the distillation system is taken 
          down to whatever the damn thing can manage. There is some VIOLENT bumping 
          for a minute and a little water jumps through to the receiver. ZWIT 
          ignores it because a little water never hurt MDP-2-P before. The heating 
          mantle was cranked way up for the projected 200C distillation temp and 
          a pale yellow begins to condense at around 180C. When charring appeared 
          imminent, the mantle was dropped down from around the flask and the 
          vacuum released. It charred anyway. Bastards!</p>
        <p>The distillate is a PALE YELLOW OIL that smells JUST LIKE CARDAMON 
          - goddamn! That's a NICE bit of information to know, kids! And that 
          smell is the smell of MDP-2-P. Yes!</p>
        <p>The yield of the distillate, and GET THIS KIDS, was 20.6g! Can you 
          believe that? To the goddamn tenth of a gram JUST LIKE SHULGIN. Maybe 
          my lab technique ain't so bad after all?</p>
        <p>Oh, and just like most ketones, be careful with it and PLASTIC! A drop 
          got on the top of ZWIT's scale and started EATING A HOLE THROUGH IT!</p>
        <p>Here's a quick review and chronology:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Fractionally distilled isosafrole - 1hr 
          <li>Formed ketone - 24hr 
            <ol type="a">
              <li> prep - .5hr 
              <li> addition of isosafrole - 2hr 
              <li> formation of epoxide - 14hr 
              <li> prep for hydrolysis - .5hr 
              <li> hydrolysis of epoxide - 4hr 
              <li> workup of ketone - 2hr 
              <li> distillation of ketone & cleanup - 2hr 
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>Note - THE charring is BAD from distilling the ketone. One of ZWIT's 
          flasks is STILL sitting in conc. HCl 6 hours later without any sign 
          of breakup.</p>
        <p>Next - the MONEY QUESTION: performing the Aluminum Amalgam Reductive 
          Amination ala Dr. Shulgin's PiHKAL #109 - does it work for the home 
          chem.idiot?</p>
        <p><b>*Part 5 - Reductive Amination of MDP-2-P to MDMA using Aluminum 
          Amalgam*</b></p>
        <p>Holy SHIT you've gotta be FAST with this one.</p>
        <p>First, let's start with making the aluminum amalgam - IT SUCKS!!! I 
          am relaying the experience from TRY NUMBER TWO because try number one 
          turned into a MONUMENTAL fiasco. Charred mess, lot's of ruined product 
          down the drain. OH THE TRAGEDY! Other than that, though, it's a very 
          nice process.</p>
        <p>Do not, I repeat, DO NOT make this until you have EVERYTHING ready 
          to go! Line up ALL your little beakers with all your little reagents 
          pre-mixed and THEN YOU CAN START MAKING THE AMALGAM!</p>
        <p>Why? THE SHIT WILL CATCH ON FIRE! God almighty can I make it through 
          a week without a fire??? I've had to refill the extinguisher TWICE already, 
          and NO IT ISN'T HALON! What will I tell the landlord???</p>
        <p>Anyway, so the nun says to the priest, "5 bucks, same as in town". 
          No, wait... Aluminum. Yes, Aluminum.</p>
        <p>So ZWITTERION has assembled 34g of MDP-2-P, which, upon scaling Shulgin's 
          reaction using a nice little spreadsheet eleusis sent me, meant 26g 
          of Aluminum needed to be cut up into little 1 inch squares. Scissors 
          were considered and abandoned in favor of ripping the living hell out 
          of the crap. You won't BELIEVE how much Aluminum foil is required to 
          make 26g! God! I must have been tearing at the shit for 30 minutes!</p>
        <p>So the Aluminum gets dumped into a plastic bowl, god forbid you amalgamate 
          mother's silver serving bowl, and approximately 900mL of water was added. 
          Next, .6g of Mercuric Chloride was dissolved in 300mL of water... well, 
          almost dissolved. The SHIT DOESN'T DISSOLVE. Oh well. It was stirred 
          BRISKLY and dumped into the plastic bowl. The whole sloppy mess was 
          stirred for several minutes while watching the news - say, nice job 
          those Serbians have done. After 5 or so minutes, the water starts to 
          turn gray and little fizzies are heard. Stirring is continued for 30 
          more minutes, occasionally, while ZWITTERION measures out the remaining 
          reagents:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>38.5g methylamine hcl in 39mL water 
          <li>93mL 25% sodium hydroxide soln. 
          <li>340mL Isopropyl alcohol 
        </ul>
        <p>The amalgam gets toasty warm, and starts steaming.</p>
        <p><i>[E - Note, next the water is drained off the Al-Hg and washed, though 
          ZWITTERION does not indicate that]</i></p>
        <p>I pour the methylamine hcl solution onto it which does nothing. Then 
          I dump a hundred mL's of the IPA on it, it calms down a bit. Next comes 
          the MDP-2-P, a little IPA in the container for rinsing, the NaOH solution 
          - whoa that's a scorcher - and finally, the remaining couple hundred 
          mL's of IPA. I mash the Al-Hg down with a Nalgene(tm) plastic stirrer 
          and commence stirring. The temperature climbs up rapidly and as it passes 
          50C I submerge the lower half of the plastic reaction cylinder into 
          cold water. The temp stabilises at 55C - whew! Just in time.</p>
        <p>The Al-Hg has a nasty tendency to rise up above the solution surface 
          forcing me to babysit the damn thing. I stir periodically, not really 
          sure if this is supposed to be a true phase-transfer type of reaction 
          or not, because, clearly, there are two phases forming when unperturbed. 
          Shulgin doesn't specify, so I opt for periodic stirring, figuring it 
          will only be half-fucked up if I'm wrong.</p>
        <p>After an hour of this, the reaction temp falls from it's stable 55C 
          down to about 35C, but every time I stir it, it jumps back up to 45C. 
          Shulgin sez the reaction is done when it hits room temperature, but 
          he didn't say anything about the temperature jumping while stirring. 
          Fuck it - I'll let it sit all night if I have to, because god-damn, 
          I expect to get 26g of MDMA out of this!</p>
        <p>4 hours later, the shit is STILL hovering at 35C, and bubbling like 
          a mini-volcano every few minutes or so. Very bizarre stuff, but not 
          even something as mindlessly fascinating as this can hold ZWITTERION's 
          interest for long, so I go to a bar for a couple of stiff drinks.</p>
        <p>After 7 hours total elapsed time, the temp is at 27C, the waters are 
          calm with a delicate amber tint, much like apple juice. A small amount 
          of turbidity is present, so it isn't quite the "clear yellow overhead" 
          that Shulgin describes. Great, it's probably contaminated with MPTP 
          or something.</p>
        <p>ZWIT decants the overhead and filters on the vacuum buchner. Next, 
          25 mL of Methanol is added to the sludge and half is filtered. The paper 
          is changed and 25mL more MeOH is added for filtering the remaining half.</p>
        <p>The total filtered solution is then distilled under vacuum. The temperature 
          rises from a start of about 37C to 53C where it stays for SEVERAL HOURS. 
          There is A LOT of liquid that must be removed from the mixture, so be 
          prepared to spend a LONG time at the vac. pump. BTW - ZWIT estimates 
          his pathetic pump to be pulling a GODDAMN WORTHLESS 80mm Hg, assuming 
          the highest boiling fraction to be stripped is water. After a total 
          of approximately 8 hours distilling, there remained 55g of a reddish-yellow 
          liquid with some water and perhaps 10g of what appeared to be regular 
          old table salt. I wasn't about to sprinkle any on my dinner, if you 
          know what I mean.</p>
        <p>ZWIT only has 2 250mL Sep funnels, so the next part of the process 
          was a REAL TREAT, lemme tell ya. The reddish liquid was dumped into 
          a half- gallon apple juice container which contained 1.54L of distilled 
          water. ZWIT then did a Tag Team no-holds-barred elimination match with 
          his two sep funnels. The suspension was first acidified to pH 5 using 
          10% HCl. It took approximately 100mL to get it there. Next it was washed 
          by successively treating 7 225mL portions with 2x15mL of methylene chloride. 
          After this strenuous TEDIUM, ZWIT had a cigarette break - to fully enjoy 
          the carcinogenic methylene chloride vapors that were assuredly in the 
          air.</p>
        <p>Next the washed suspension was basified to pH 9 by the addition of 
          approximately 75mL of 10% NaOH. The suspension turned white with just 
          a slight tinge of pink. Also, on the bottom there was a thin layer of 
          PRODUCT!!! Now kids, it's time to have a little chemistry lesson as 
          to WHY Shulgin likely specified methylene chloride as the organic solvent 
          here: Because it is denser than water, and so is our product. This means 
          that there is no wish-washiness on whether the organic layer will go 
          to the top or bottom of the sep funnel depending on how much dissolved 
          product is in it - it will always want to go to the bottom!</p>
        <p><i>[E - this is a nice explanation but not likely correct. the real 
          reason probably has more to do with the relative solubility of the amine 
          in CH2Cl2 rather than it's density]</i></p>
        <p>The 7 deal thing was repeated, except using 2x20mL portions of methylene 
          chloride to extract into.</p>
        <p>The MDMA-laden methylene chloride, a distinctive clear red in color, 
          was then distilled on the heating mantle with an ice-water condensor 
          flow to strip off the solvent. The temp stays dead on 40C for a little 
          over an hour and solvent removal is stopped after the temperature FALLS 
          (no more vapor coming over, kids). Yield of oil is 24g - hey! Where'd 
          the other 2 grams go to??? Oh yes. I almost forgot - this is the BASE, 
          not the SALT. The salt will weigh heavier. Okay.</p>
        <p>ZWIT always wondered why Shulgin went to the extra trouble of distilling 
          the MDMA oil that remains after stripping the solvent. It's just asking 
          for trouble in my book, especially if you don't have a good vacuum pump, 
          like me (poor things' been subjected to every corrosive substance on 
          the planet, just about). ZWIT added 100mL of IPA to the flask, swirled, 
          then dumped the red liquid into beaker. ZWIT is about to find out WHY 
          you distill the product...</p>
        <p>Next is crystal-forming time! Are we EXCITED yet or what??? Boy this 
          sure beats making cyanogen bromide any day of the week.</p>
        <p>ZWIT adds 10mL of concentrated HCl (muriatic acid - if it's good enough 
          for cleaning concrete, it's good enough for drugs) to the beaker while 
          swirling. There is quite a bit of fuming, but no crystals form!?!? Puzzled, 
          ZWIT adds 200mL of ether, and now there is a dilute solution with still 
          no crystals forming. ZWIT suspects one of two things here: either the 
          water content of the IPA (9%) or the water content of my well-used ether 
          (it's assuredly no longer anhydrous) is the culprit, or it's because 
          I didn't DISTILL the goddamn shit like I was supposed to. Awwwwww jeez 
          don't tell me I have to do an acid/base extraction on this shit and 
          DISTILL yet again today?</p>
        <p><i>[E - ZWITTERION used too much HCl. Only enough to get the pH mildly 
          acidic is necessary. Also, the crude MDMA must be vacuum distilled at 
          a pressure of 40mm Hg (bp(40): 200C) or lower, to avoid decomposition.]</i></p>
        <p>ZWIT, wanting to avoid this as much as possible, evaporates off the 
          solvents to leave a syrupy reddish-brown liquid that smells RIGHT, but 
          doesn't LOOK too healthy. This liquid was then poured onto a glass dinner 
          plate and set on top of a frying pan with boiling water to get it nice 
          and toasty warm for about an hour. The plate was removed and set to 
          cool on the counter, SLOWLY.</p>
        <p>The next morning, there were CRYSTALS. Of course, they were somewhat 
          brownish and not at all "sellable", but some judicious washing can take 
          care of that problem.</p>
        <p>Total yield of crystals, pre-purification: 28.4g! <br>
          Total yield of crystals, after Et2O wash: 27.0g! <br>
          (2x25mL Ether was used)</p>
        <p>The crystals were a light brown and had just the right smell: a hint 
          of cardamon mixed with amine! Ahh the JOY of home COOKING!</p>
        <p>Kids, if you want to try this yourself, remember, it's a GODDAMN FELONY 
          AND A HALF! But, please, learn from my MISTAKES and then you might REVEL 
          IN MY SUCCESS!</p>
