<p>This is for all of you Dr. Shulgin fans out there that might be a little 
miffed at poor yields when attempting mild reductive aminations (not the 
fruity little Disney characters, kids). The trick here is *cleaning* the 
damned foil before you use it. Follow closely, be careful with the mercuric 
solutions, they can be absorbed transdermally (in other words, use gloves, 
dumbass).

<h3>Preparation of Aluminum Amalgam</h3>

<p>Aluminum Amalgam is a useful mild reducing agent which requires careful
preparation in order to be effective. The following is adapted from
Vogel's Practical Organic Chemistry.

<p>Prepare 10% Sodium Hydroxide solution by dissolving 20g NaOH in 180mL
of distilled water.

<p>Prepare a ~2% Mercuric (II) Chloride solution by dissolving 1g of HgCl2
in 50mL of distilled water.

<p>Cut 40g of aluminum foil into small squares approximately .5cm a side.

<p>Place the aluminum into a large beaker or other suitable glass container
and cover with the sodium hydroxide solution. Heat gently in a well
ventilated area until hydrogen gas evolves vigorously for about 3
minutes. Strain the foil through a plastic colander and wash first with
distilled water, then with denatured alcohol. Pat dry then add to a
beaker with the 2% HgCl2 solution. Allow to amalgamate for 2 minutes
then pour off the supernatant. It is unethical to pour mercury compounds
down the drain, but you'll probably do it anyway ;-). Now wash the foil
in the colander as before, with distilled water, ethanol, and then a
little bit of ether. Submerge the aluminum amalgam in ether to store
until use.
