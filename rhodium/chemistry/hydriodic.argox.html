INTRO:</font><br>
<p>
This is a really long-winded write-up, but have faith; your patience
will be rewarded.   Mixed in with a boring discussion of
chemical reactions, I've decided to liven things up by including
detailed instructions on how to obtain a new luxury car, so bear with
me.
</p>

<p>
Argox has been slandered on this Forum.   But none dare say
poseur.   The following write-up is based on EXPERIENCE, not
made-up bullshit that passes for knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Hydriodic acid is illegal to manufacture or possess in
California.   It may even be illegal where you
live.   Find out.   In the republic where Argox
resides, a person can manufacture hydriodic and not go to
jail.   The jail time comes from making meth with it, or
selling it to meth chemists, but avoiding prison is where your native
cunning comes into play.   Check out the legality of
hydriodic in your neck of the woods before you make several hundred
liters, just in case.
</p>

<font color="green"><br>
BACKGROUND AND TERMS:
</font>

<p>
Hydriodic acid is a fuming corrosive liquid, clear yellow to muddy
brown in color.   Hydrogen iodide is a transparent fuming
corrosive gas.  57% hydriodic acid is a constant boiling (127ºC/760
mm)  mixture of hydrogen iodide and water.
</p>

<p>
In this write-up, the notation HI will refer to hydrogen iodide--a
gas.   The notation HI<sub>(aq)</sub> will refer to 57%
hydriodic acid--a liquid.
</p>

<p>
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> is used in the clandestine production of meth
amphetamine.  HI<sub>(aq)</sub> reduces ephedrine to methamphetamine
and can be regenerated by red phosphorus (RP) and water.
Instructions for making meth using this method can be found elsewhere
on this Forum.   I don't know if the instructions are any
good or not.   I've never made meth and don't know fuck all
about making it.   This is absolutely true.
However, I am familiar with its market dynamics.
</p>

<p>
HI and HI<sub>(aq)</sub> are strictly and successfully controlled by
the war-on-drugs agencies, since these compounds are relatively
obscure and little used by industry.   Any attempt to
purchase HI or HI<sub>(aq)</sub> from a legitimate supplier will draw
the attention of the authorities.   Guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
Ephedrine-based meth laboratories in the 50 to 100 kg/week range will
have clandestine sources for ephedrine, RP, and
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   The black market price of
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> varies according to local market
conditions.   It ranges from $us[deleted] to $us[deleted]per
liter in North America, with wide swings in price in the same area
depending on its availability and the amount of meth manufacture
taking place at the time.   A liter of HI<sub>(aq)</sub>
weighs 1,700 grams and contains 970 grams of HI.
</p>

<p>
The clandestine meth chemist without a black market source for
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, or the enterprising chemist who wishes to supply
the former, have three choices for making HI<sub>(aq)</sub>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <p>
Combine iodine and red phosphorus, carefully add water.
This method is widely used by those chemists who supply meth labs with
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   However, it has the disadvantage of
using watched chemicals.   Red phosphorus (RP) is
controlled.   Iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) is watched.
Obtaining OTC RP and I<sub>2</sub> is not a serious
endevour.   OTC RP from match box strikers and OTC iodine
from tincture is time consuming and labor intensive.   Only
tweakers will attempt to make their own RP and
I<sub>2</sub>.   Besides, this write-up is all about making
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> from innocuous non-watched ingredients at any scale.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
Bubble hydrogen sulfide gas through an aqueous slurry of
I<sub>2</sub>, distill HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.
    </p>

    <center>H<sub>2</sub>S + I<sub>2(aq)</sub> --> 2HI<sub>(aq)</sub> + Sº </center>

    <p>
This method is suitable for large-scale production of
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   The disadvantage is that hydrogen
sulfide is extremely poisonous.   I really want to stress
that the novice clandestine chemist should never attempt to generate
H<sub>2</sub>S.   H<sub>2</sub>S is a deadly
poison.   There is no antidote.   With a lethal
dose measured in small ppm's, death can be expected in 15 minutes from
acute cellular asphyxiation.
    </p>

    <p>
I was once gassed with hydrogen cyanide, which is similar in toxicity
to hydrogen sulfide, luckily there IS an antidote for cyanide
poisoning, and my lab was equipped with a Lilly kit and my co-workers
were quick to respond, and the chief chemist had the brains to show up
at the emergency room in that poor South American town with a bottle
of thiosulfate.   Had the gas been H<sub>2</sub>S instead of
HCN, Argox would not be here to tell the tale.   Having said
that, for manufacturing HI<sub>(aq)</sub> in quantities above 20
liters/day, this would be the most practical method.
However, I repeat that H<sub>2</sub>S is deadly poison, and if
anything goes wrong, you and everybody in the immediate area will be
at risk of dying.   The obnoxious smell of H<sub>2</sub>S at
low concentrations quickly overwhelms the senses at higher
concentrations, and it is quite common for the victim to assume that
'the smell went away, so everything's OK.'  Usually the last wrong
assumption they ever make...
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p> React potassium iodide with ortho-phosphoric acid, recover
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> and HI.   The chemistry of phosphorous is
complex.   Observation indicates that the following are the
major reactions:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
        <p>
KI + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sub>(aq)</sub> + delta temp-->
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>+ KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
        </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>
KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + KI + delta temp--> HI +
K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub><br>
        </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>
additional HI<sub>(aq)</sub> and HI is obtained throughout the
dehydration of potassium phosphate salts and polymerization of same
while reacting with potassium iodide at high temperature--400+ºC
        </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>
This method has the advantage of being safe and controllable and uses
non watched ingredients.   The process is similar to a
simple distillation, and requires only the type of glassware normally
owned by the clandestine chemist.   For 10 liters/day of
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, this method is ideal, requiring only a 22L RB flask
and heating mantle.   A 12L-10L RB flask /heating mantle
will produce 5 liters/day; a 5L RB flask/heating mantle 2.5
liters/day, etc.   The heating mantle is a key element in
making HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, oil and sand baths will not take the
temperature high enough.   The tweaker can use a 1L
erlenmeyer with single 24/40 neck on a stirrer/hot plate combo and
produce 300-400 cc in a couple of hours.   (Percent recovery
is a function of scale.   At larger scales, more
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> will be recovered mol/mol per KI.   92%
recovery mol/mol at the 22L scale and larger, contrasted with only 75%
at the 1L scale.   Why this is true I can only speculate,
but it is true nonetheless.)
        </p>
        </li>

    </ol>
</ol>
<p>
Now, for the first time on the Hive, this easy method will be
explained step-by-step.
</p>

<font color="green"><br>
GENERAL OVERVIEW:</font><br>

<p>
Disregard everything that has appeared previously  on the Hive
regarding the reaction of KI and
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.   I used TFSE extensively while
initially researching this procedure, and without exception, all
previous information is unclear, misleading, and, in several cases,
made-up bullshit.   The HI FAQ on Rhodium's page, as regards
KI and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, is erroneous.   But you
can count on my write-up to tell you exactly how to make
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> safely.   No bullshit here.
</p>

<p>
Here is a general overview of the procedure, specifics to follow:
</p>

<p>
In general terms, you will be mixing KI powder with
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> liquid in a stirred RB flask on a heating
mantle rigged for atmospheric distillation.   The RB flask
will be equipped with an condenser for downward distillation, a
receiver to recover HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, and a second receiver/trap
filled with dH<sub>2</sub>O in which to bubble and recover HI.
</p>

<p>
KI will be converted first into HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, then into
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> and HI as the reaction proceeds.
Hydriodic acid will distill at 105 to 127ºC.   After the
initial run of acid is produced and the contents of the reactor
cooled,  the dilute hydriodic acid will be redistilled to produce
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   The dilute hydriodic acid from the
redistillation that comes over at less than 127ºC will be reused in
subsequent reactions in the HI trap/receiver.   No dilute
acid should go to waste.   Overall efficiency goes way up by
recycling the dilute acid into the next batch.
</p>

<p>
If this procedure sounds complicated, it's not, and your good buddy
Argox  will shortly give you all the tips, short cuts, and safety
considerations that you will need to successfully make
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> the first time.
</p>

<p>
Making 10L of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> in a 22L reactor takes one full 24
hour day from start to finish.   This includes setting up
the glassware and dismantling and cleaning up for the next
batch.   You need to stay awake during the
reaction.   The reaction should not be left unattended for
more than 10 minutes.   The dynamics are continually
changing as the reaction proceeds; suckback can be a concern: you need
to stay on top of it.   It takes the same amount of time in
a [deleted], but if you have the resources and knowledge to set up at
that scale, you're a master, not a student, and need no further
instruction from me.
</p>

<p>
The reaction is simple.   However, there are two caveats.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat One</b>--there is a white crystalline precipitate left in the
bottom of the flask after the reaction is over and everything has
cooled--condensed phosphates.   This residue is insoluble in
hot water and non polar solvents.   It must be physically
scraped from the flask.   (Not a difficult chore with a 1L
or 2 L, but with a 3N 22L  RB count on breaking at least one
neck.   On a larger scale the problem can be solved by
investing in a [deleted] with a large center flange opening that will
allow you to get your arm inside and scrape.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat Two</b>--the majority of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> is produced at a
temperature above the melting point of Teflon.   Teflon
paddles will melt and make the phosphate residue even more
impervious.   Teflon stir bars will melt, revealing the
magnet.   But really, who cares?   Don't sweat the
Teflon.   (After all, once that first hypothetical batch of
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> goes out the hypothetical door, you can afford to
buy a $20 sheet of Teflon and cut a dozen new paddles.)
Glass-coated metal rods and blades are the answer for the
perfectionist in the audience.   Just keep in mind that no
exposed metal can be anywhere near HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   Drop
one little  drop on your heating mantle and watch it burn a hole
through the aluminum housing on its way to China.   COVER
your heating mantle with foil--lots of it!  That's my way of saying
that freshly made HI<sub>(aq)</sub> is very, very
corrosive.   So don't even think of entering the lab without
eye protection, a lab coat, and good rubber gloves.   If two
drops of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> can burn a serious indentation into a
cast-iron lab stand base, imagine what a splash of acid will do to
your skin, or worse, an eye.

<font color="green"><br>
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="blue">1.   Obtain ingredients.</font>
</p>

<p>
Ortho-phosphoric acid, (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) commonly called
phosphoric acid, a thick clear syrupy liquid, can be purchased or
ordered from the neighborhood hydroponics store.   They sell
it as 'pH Down.'  Conversely you can order it from the chem
supply.   Don't respond with posts belly aching about how
you're too paranoid or too smart to buy from the chem supply, and need
a write-up that is 100% over-the-counter at Wal-Mart.
Argox is not the guy to bitch to about chemicals not being available
at the corner Circle K.   He recently tried to help in that
regard and only received grief for his effort.   Finding
chems is what separates the men from the boys, the serious from the
dilettantes.   Back to subject.   Buy 75%
technical grade phosphoric acid--this works best.
Phosphoric acid is non watched and OTC.   It's in
everything, even Coca-Cola.   Next to sulfuric acid,
phosphoric is the most common acid on the planet.   You can
find it on the shelf at the hydroponics store.   DO NOT
listen to all those posts about how you can get phosphoric acid at
Home Depot or the flooring company.   That is bullshit.  [A
personal aside--I think bees should receive a rating, like on
e-bay.   Except it would be a bullshit rating.
The more bullshit you post, the more negative the rating.]  The
phosphoric acid sold for cleaning tile is only 15-25% acid, the rest
is water, surfactants, soap, and stuff that will fuck up the
reaction.   Make sure you buy 75% technical grade
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.   It is strictly OTC, so no
bitching.   One gallon on the store shelf retails for
$us20--be sure and read the label--some 'pH Down' is nitric acid--you
want the label to say 'phosphoric acid.'  A 5 gallon pail can be
ordered from a hydroponics store for $us65.
</p>

<p>
Potassium iodide, a heavy white crystalline powder, can be bought at
the chem supply.   It is non watched and non
controlled.   You can buy it on-line.   Technical
grade is OK, but most supply houses only stock the USP
grade.   The higher price for USP grade in the global scheme
of things is insignificant, buy whatever is easiest to
obtain.   USP KI can be purchased for $us36/kg.
There is a boom in KI these days, because of the terrorism scare, take
advantage of the general panic and buy a lot if it now, you will
absolutely go unnoticed.   1.3 kg of KI will yield one liter
of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> at 94% efficiency (very large scale), so order
accordingly, before the WOD reads this post and adds KI to the 'List.'
</p>

<p>
<font color="blue"><br>2.   Test ingredients.</font>
</p>

<p>
Determine the concentration of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> by boiling
it.   Below is a chart of boiling points for different
concentrations of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.   You want
yours to boil at 135º.   That will indicate 75%
acid.   If your sample boils at a lesser temperature, don't
despair, boil all your acid until it reaches 135º (and then make sure
to get 75% next time).   You can boil phosphoric acid in an
open beaker on the hot plate.   The fumes are non-toxic and
non-corrosive--they smell like Sprite (because phosphoric acid is used
to give soft drinks that citric flavor).
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> is generally unreactive at room
temperature--have no fear about mixing room temperature
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and KI in the RB flask.
Nothing will happen.   At room temperature,
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and KI will not react.

<p>
<font color="blue">3.   Mix ingredients</font>
</p>

<p>
The mol/mol ratio of KI to H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>(100% basis)
that works best, according to EXPERIENCE, is about 1:1.2.
Here is how that is calculated:
</p>

<p>
1 mole KI = 166 grams<br>
1 mole H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (100% basis) = 98 grams = 131 grams of 75% H< sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br>
1 X 166 = 166<br>
1.2 X 131 = 157<br>
157/166 = 0.946
</p>

<p>
Therefore, for every ten grams of KI, add 9.5 grams of 75%
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.   Nobody will get mad if you
just add equal parts (weight/weight--w/w) KI and
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.   Now you understand how  I
arrived at this simple formula.   Although it sounds almost
flippant to say add equal parts by weight KI and 75%
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, truth be told this formula was obtained
after lots of trial and error.   Adding more acid will not
increase yield, but you can try it, nothing bad will happen.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I post this, three or four of the usual suspects will
follow up with posts saying that I'm full of shit and that what you
really need to do is add water so that all the HI will have enough
water to come over at 57%.   See, if you figure 1 mole of KI
has 137 grams of iodine and with the one proton donated by the
phosphoric acid that makes 138 grams of HI, so 138 grams of HI would
need 104 grams of water to make 57% HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.
Follow me?  These arm-chair chemists will then tell you that the equal
w/w 75% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> to KI only adds  about 42 grams of
water, therefore they will say to add 62 grams of distilled water in
addition to the phosphoric acid for every mole of KI.
Don't listen to them.   I'm heading them off at the pass
right now.   The reaction just doesn't work that way.  (How
do I know?  I thought of adding more water from the git-go and tried
it.   I've also experimented with every concentration of
phosphoric acid from 50% to 105%.)  If you add more water, you will
only generate a shit load of dilute acid, which must be distilled off
before the real acid is made.   See, what the arm-chair
chemists don't know because they haven't actually done this, is that
most of the HI<sub>(aq)</sub> comes over AFTER all the water from the
75% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> has distilled off.   The
bulk of the HI<sub>(aq)</sub> is formed from the dehydration of 105%
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> at high temperature, a process typical of
the complex chemistry of phosphates.   The
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> actually polymerizes into long-chain
'condensed' phosphates and gives off water and donates a proton in the
process.   This is the water and hydrogen that make most of
the HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   And those long-chain polymers are
what stick to the bottom of your flask like stink on a
pig.   And even if I'm somehow wrong on the theory, in
practice I am right on target.
</p>

<p>
Now that you know how much to add, just dump the two ingredients into
an appropriately sized flask.   Nothing will happen at room
temperature.   There is no fizzing or effervescence during
the entire reaction, so you can fill the flask fairly
full.   But no more than 60% for a RB, less for an
erlenmeyer.   But you already know that, right, because you
have at least rudimentary lab skills, right?  There will be a period
of some massive bumping at a larger scale once the water boils off and
the polymerization begins, even with agitation, so if you are faint of
heart, fill the flask only 30%.   At 1L, 3L and 5L bumping
is not a problem.   The bumping is nerve-wracking at the 22L
scale.   At [deleted] scale the bumping will make you jump
out of your fucking skin.   Agitation helps but doesn't
eliminate bumping altogether, so if you get scared easy, add less
ingredients.   It's really a function of balls versus
greed.   If you have the <i>pelotas</i>, then load that
sucker up, 'cause it's a full 24 hours whether you make a  little or a
lot.   If the doors come down, the charges will be the same,
as well, so I say go for it.
</p>

<p>
<font color="blue">4.   React ingredients</font>
</p>

<p>
UNDER A FUME HOOD, heat and stir the ingredients--it's that
simple.   At 65º an obvious reaction will take
place.   The clear solution will turn dark
brown.   This is hydriodic acid being formed.
Keep the heat on high, don't let off.   The solution will
begin to boil at 105ºC  and a small amount of milky white distillate
will come over into the receiver.
</p>

<font color="red">READ THIS PART--IT'S IMPORTANT.</font>
This initial white distillate and the gas bubbles that are generated
at this initial stage of the reaction are poisonous.  (OK.
OK.   Hydriodic acid is hardly something you want to drink
for breakfast either, but this white distillate is REALLY poisonous,
even compared to HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.)  You must remove this white milky
distillate once the first drops of yellow or brown acid start to come
over.   So begin the reaction with a small RB flask as a
receiver, say 100 to 250 cc.   Collect the initial white
distillate and stopper it.   DO NOT BREATHE this stuff, I'll
explain what it is in a minute.   If you do this reaction on
a small scale, the white distillate may only be a few drops, get rid
of it anyway.   On a large scale, it is enough to kill
you.   You will have a second receiver filled with
dH<sub>2</sub>O to recover HI.   However, at the beginning,
substitute it for a small flask filled with dilute NaOH solution or
the dilute aqua ammonia ('clear ammonia') that you can buy at the
grocery store.   Why?  Because the first distillate and the
initial gas contain H<sub>2</sub>S (the same hydrogen sulfide that I
mentioned being deadly poison at the beginning of this long-winded
tome).   My guess is that since phosphoric acid is often
made from the reaction of sulfuric acid on phosphate rock, trace
amounts of sulfur remain in the phosphoric acid.   HI is a
powerful reducing agent (that's why the meth guys need it), so there
is a redox between HI and any sulfides.  (2HI + MeS + delta temp
-->H<sub>2</sub>S + I<sub>2</sub> + Meº.   And since
H<sub>2</sub>S is less soluble and more volatile than HI, it comes
over first.)  This is something else the arm-chair chemists won't warn
you against, but count on Argox to keep you safe, if you pay
attention.   Like I said, the tweaker with the 1L won't
notice anything, but the bee loading up a 22L could end up very sick,
if my advice is not followed.   Anyway, add any base,
preferably NaOH or ammonia to the white distillate under a fume hood
before you toss it out and as long as the initial bubbles are taken up
in NaOH solution or ammonia solution, and that solution is also poured
down the sink, you will never even know that Argox just saved you from
a hospital trip or at least from having to suck on your oxygen bottle
for an hour or so.  (The arm-chair guys will say that HI smells like
H<sub>2</sub>S and that I'm just confusing one with the other--they
are wrong--you can get a good nasal dose of HI fumes and apart from
the pain, nothing will happen to you.   Get a good dose of
H<sub>2</sub>S and you are going to be unconscious in a few
minutes.   Initially your teeth will tingle, everything will
spin, and as you collapse to your knees, you will realize that this is
it, you are going to die.   If you're lucky, like me, you'll
wake up in the emergency room puking sodium thiosulfate (oh yeah,
that's cyanide poisoning, for which an antidote exists--if you breath
H<sub>2</sub>S, you're shit outta luck--there's no
antidote).   Anyway I digress: HI smells rotten, but pales
in comparison to the deadly stench of H<sub>2</sub>S.

After getting rid of the initial milky white distillate and taking up
the initial bubbles in a dilute base and throwing both away, connect
your two regular receivers.   This is an atmospheric
distillation, so relax.   Just keep the heat on high and the
overhead or magnetic stirring going.   On a smaller scale,
stirring is not necessary.   For bees with big equipment who
lust after the perfect yield, stir.
</p>

<p>
The reaction is not over when all the brown acid has boiled out of the
reactor, it has just begun.   Keep the heat on high and
watch in amazement as more and more and more acid keeps forming in the
condenser.   Don't worry about the thermometer at the still
head going above 127ºC, it is still HI<sub>(aq)</sub> coming over,
just the temp inside the reactor is getting HOT.   At 400ºC
both HI<sub>(aq)</sub> and HI will come over.   Lots of HI
at a larger scale, so be prepared for it.   About 10% of the
total acid production will be in the form of HI that must be collected
in the water trap/receiver.   HI is exceedingly soluble in
water and the dissolution is exothermic, so stirring is not absolutely
necessary, but cooling is.   More than 10% of the total acid
comes over as HI, but most of it is being absorbed by the liquid in
the receiver catching the distillate.   That is why you keep
the dilute acid in the receiver even after the 57% acid comes
over.   If you remove the initial dilute acid and then
collect the 127ºC boiling fraction (HI<sub>(aq)</sub>) as a separate
fraction, then to your dismay, you will have loads of HI coming over
that must be caught in water.   And then you will find that
the hydriodic acid in the receiver is incredibly concentrated-- 70%
not 57%.   The 70% acid gives off so much fumes that
handling it is a challenge.   So just let ALL the acid
collect in the same receiver flask, make sure your receiver is big
enough, and you won't have to deal with much actual HI gas.
</p>

<font color="red">{If you don't have a clue about how to set up a for
atmospheric distillation with a still head and condenser and water
traps and such, and don't know about RBs and heating mantles, and how
to control suck-back, and if none of what you are reading makes much
sense, and especially if you don't have a good fume cabinet--PLEASE
don't try this.   There are less dramatic ways to kill
yourself than producing a shitload of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> and spilling
it.}</font>
<p></p>

<p>
The reaction is over when no more HI<sub>(aq)</sub> or HI is
produced.   The reaction is over when no more acid drips
into the receiver and/or suck-back begins to be a real problem in the
water trap (suck-back with HI is violent--the most violent of any gas
Argox has ever worked with, make SURE you have an empty trap to catch
suck back).   The remaining contents of the reactor will
look like white  taffy.   The dilute acid in the receiver
will look dark brown.   The dilute acid in the water trap
will be a clear brownish yellow.   Once no more acid comes
over, you can turn off the heat, take off the water trap, and allow
the glassware to cool--slowly.   Keep in mind that your
glassware is at 400ºC, so don't even think about handling it or
taking it out of the mantle or off of the hotplate--the thermal shock
will crack the flask instantly.   Since you know Argox
doesn't make this shit up (unlike others, nameless for now), this
means that he found out the hard way about thermal shock and cracking
glassware, and is saving you a lot of grief with these words of
wisdom.

<font color="blue">5.   Redistill HI<sub>(aq)</sub></font>
</p>

<p>
There are two ways of telling if your acid is 57%:
</p>

<p>
1) Weigh it in a graduated cylinder--the density of 57% acid is 1.7.
500 cc will weigh 850 grams, exactly.   Anything less is not
57%.
</p>

<p>
2)  Boil it.  57% hydriodic acid boils at 125-127ºC.
</p>

<p>
(OK.   OK.   Get back on your chair.   I
was just kidding to see if you were awake.   A little black
humor--of course you don't fucking boil it, it will corrode everything
in your lab including your lungs, just weigh it.)
</p>

<p>
Probably none of the initial acid collected in either of the receivers
is going to be 57%.   Weigh it to find out.   If
its density is less than 1.7, then you must redistill.   No
sweat.   There is a short cut that makes this a snap.
</p>

<p>
The redistillation is a straitforward atmospheric
distillation.   No gas will be generated.   As
soon as the acid boils and starts coming over you must watch the
thermometer at the still head.   As soon as it reaches 125º,
change receivers.   Everything that comes over from that
point forward is 57% HI<sub>(aq)</sub>.   The very last drop
will distill out of the boiling flask.   No residue will be
left, it all boils.   In fact, after you have done this
distillation once, you will quickly figure out the obvious short
cut--collect the fraction that comes over at less than 127º, and then
turn off the heat and everything left in your boiling flask is 57%
HI<sub>(aq)</sub>, no need to distill it--it's already
pure.   Just allow it to cool before you package it up.

<font color="blue"><br>6.   Hypothetical considerations</font>
</p>

<p>
What follows is the only speculative part of this
write-up.   You might call this Argox' version of made-up
bullshit.   However, even my bullshit should be instructive.
</p>

<p>
How might the public view hypothetical shop-made HI<sub>(aq)</sub>?
(It depends on their intelligence, of course.)  See, acid made by the
method I have just detailed is dirty brown.   This is due to
trace amounts of HI being oxidized to I<sub>2</sub> as it comes over
in the condenser (4HI + O2 = 2I<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O) and
from impurities in the tech grade KI.   The brown color is
insignificant, and does not interfere with the potency of shop-made
acid.   Commercial HI<sub>(aq)</sub> contains a reducing
agent as a stabilizer, usually hypophosphorous acid, and is clear
yellow.   In the hypothetical case you use this write-up for
other than purely theoretical considerations, at some point the topic
of off color might arise.   But, again, speaking
hypothetically,  I would recommend that you educate rather than
stabilize.   Unstabilized shop-made HI<sub>(aq)</sub> will
work just as well as the store-bought variety in a hypothetical user's
hypothetical application.   The difference is purely
cosmetic.   The way to convert dirty brown acid into clear
yellow acid is to add red phosphorous and heat it.   But
hey!   Wait a minute!   Isn't that what a
hypothetical user might be doing anyway?   Adding RP and
heating it?   Explain this to whomever,
hypothetically.   Give whoever a demonstration in a test
tube.   Convince them.   Hypothetically.
</p>

<p>
Once the hypothetical user overcomes his or her initial reluctance,
don't be surprised with the heavy pounding on the door late one
night--no, it's not the cops, it might be that hypothetical person
begging for more hypothetical acid.   The word might
hypothetically spread to others, and the all-request line become
incessant.   Of course, I really wouldn't know anything
about any of this...it's all just hypothetical.   I am
making it up, OK.
</p>

<p>
As for packaging, hypothetically pour  acid into amber glass bottles,
or better yet, the red .....oh shit, since this is all hypothetical, I
wouldn't want to be hypothetically linked to a certain bottle...hell,
if you are intelligent enough to make acid, you can figure out in what
to put it.   Remember--one liter of HI<sub>(aq)</sub> weighs
exactly 1,700 grams.   In the hypothetical case the
hypothetical user goes into a production frenzy and needs volume,
think black HDPE jerrycans.
</p>

<p>
HI<sub>(aq)</sub> must be protected against light and always stored in
a cool (temperature and otherwise cool) area AWAY from
people.   I wouldn't freeze it, but since I've never frozen
any, I couldn't really say what might happen.   The acid
will slowly degrade over time, but no big deal.   Without a
stabilizing agent, HI will slowly revert to I<sub>2</sub>.
But like I said, no problem:  the hypothetical user's hypothetical
application will solve that hypothetical problem.
</p>

<p>
With your native intelligence, you'll figure out all sorts of other
shortcuts and useful procedures in the off-chance you actually paid
attention and hypothetically decide to make a little hypothetical
acid.

Don't recall anything in all this gibberish about chemical reactions
