<p><b>Here is announced experimental from <i>J. Org. Chem. 221 (1951)</i>:</b></p>

<p>In a 5-liter 3-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and reflux condenser were
placed 1000 mL of ethanol and 110 g of beta-nitroisoeugenol. The mixture was
heated with stirring and, when the nitroisoeugenol was dissolved, 2500 mL of
hot water was added. With heating and vigorous stirring, 200 g of reduced iron
powder and 8 g of hydrated ferric chloride were added. With continued stirring
100 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added slowly. The hydrochloric
acid caused a violent reaction which subsided after about 5 minutes; the mixture
was refluxed with stirring for two hours and then distilled under reduced
pressure until approximately 2 liters of distillate was collected. The residue
was filtered, and the fluffy iron oxide was washed thoroughly with hot water and
then with ether. The combined filtrate and washings were acidified strongly with
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ether. The ether was dried and distilled to
yield a light oil which was fractionated in vacuo to give 68 g of vanillyl
methyl ketone boiling at 126-127&deg;C at 0.3 mm (72% yield).</p>

<p>3,4-Dimethoxyphenylacetone and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone were prepared from the corresponding &beta;-nitropropenylbenzenes by almost identical 
procedures with 90 and 72% yield.</p>

<p>For preparation of 2-MeO-P2P with toluene/water as solvent see <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv4p0573"><strong>Organic Syntheses, Coll. vol. 4, p. 573.</strong></a></p>

<p><b>My modification of this preparation:</b></p>

<p>In a 2-liter 3-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and reflux condenser were
placed 460 ml of ethanol<a href="mdp2p.piperonal.html#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> and 67 g of &beta;-nitroisosafrole<a href="mdp2p.piperonal.html#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. The mixture
was heated with stirring and, when the yellow crystals were dissolved, 1100 ml
of hot water was added. With heating and vigorous stirring, 80 g of reduced iron
powder<a href="mdp2p.piperonal.html#notes"><sup>3</sup></a> and 5 g  FeCl<sub>3</sub>&middot;6H<sub>2</sub>O were added. With continued stirring 63 ml conc.
HCl was added in 30 min. The mixture was refluxed with stirring for 2 h and then
distilled under atmospheric pressure<a href="mdp2p.piperonal.html#notes"><sup>4</sup></a>. The residue was filtered and brown
iron oxide was extracted 3x50 ml CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Filtrate and organic washings were
acidified with HCl and red ketone layer was collected. Light green water layer
was extracted 2x100 ml CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The combined extracts were dried with Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>and distilled at atmospheric pressure (80&deg;C bath). Dichloromethane was
completely removed in vacuo to give 55 g of crude MDP2P as deep red oil which
was used for CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>/Al reaction.</p>

<a name="notes"></a><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="oli">Use of methanol instead of ethanol led to incomplete dissolution of yellow crystals.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">&beta;-Nitroisosafrole can be conveniently prepared by Knoevenagel: 150 g of piperonal was mixed with 76 ml nitroethane (piperonal should completely 
dissolve to give colourless liquid) and 1.5 ml of <em>n</em>-butylamine (or <em>n</em>-pentylamine) was added. Resulting yellow solution was held in a dark place; some 
water started appear after 2-3 days as the reaction proceeded. Light orange crystals of product started precipitate after 6-8 days. After 20 days a mixture 
was filtered. Light brown filtrate was filtered again after 5 days to afford next crop of product. Yield 85-90% of light orange crystals, which are 
suitable for preparation of the ketone.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">An iron reduced with hydrogen was used. Use of 20 mesh iron powder instead of reduced iron led to less vigorous reaction, resulting ethanol didn't 
    contain NH<sub>3</sub> and ketone was contamined with about 20% of its oxime (not quantitative reduction).</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">A fraction 77-85°C was collected. It contained some NH<sub>3</sub> which can be neutralized with conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and distilled again via Vigreux column.
    Resulting 90% ethanol was used for preparation of the next portion of ketone.</span></li>
