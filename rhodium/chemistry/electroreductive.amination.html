        <h2>1. Amination of aliphatic ketones by primary amines</h2>
        <p>The reductive amination of aliphatic ketones in aqueous solutions of 
          primary amines was realized by an electrochemical method. The best yields 
          of the secondary amines were obtained at lead and cadmium cathodes in 
          an aqueous electrolytic solution at pH 11-12. Elongation and branching 
          in the<br>
          carbon chain of the radicals both of the ketone and of the primary amine 
          lead to a reduction in the yield of the secondary amine. The yield of 
          the secondary amine is mainly determined by the rate of the chemical 
          reaction leading to the formation of the azomethine compound. preceding 
          the<br>
          electrochemical reduction stage.</p>
        <p>One of the most accessible methods for the synthesis of primary and 
          secondary amines is reductive amination [1,2], which involves catalytic 
          hydrogenation of a mixture of a carbonyl compound with ammonia or a 
          primary amine. As a rule this reaction requires temperatures up to 150C 
          and pressures up to 150 atm, and its realization on a laboratory scale 
          therefore requires special equipment. In order to conduct the reaction 
          on more accessible laboratory equipment attempts were made to use other<br>
          reducing agents. Attempts to conduct the reaction electrochemically 
          have taken a special position among these researches.</p>
        <p>As far back as the beginning of the present century a German patent 
          was taken out on the production of methylamine by electrochemical reduction 
          of a mixture of formaldehyde and ammonia [3]. However, this method only 
          began to attract the attention of researchers toward the end of the 
          sixties. In [4] the production of amines by electrolysis of a ketone 
          with an aqueous solution of ammonia at a spongy lead cathode was investigated. 
          Amines were obtained from 2-butanone, 3-pentanone, and cyclohexanone 
          with yields of 38, 34, and 28% respectively.</p>
        <p>Rather more recently reductive amination of aliphatic ketones was realized 
          electrocatalytically at Raney nickel in an alkaline solution [5]. The 
          aminating agent was ammonia. With vigorous agitation amines were obtained 
          from the respective ketones with the following yields (%): 2-Propanone 
          (78), <br>
          2-butanone (74), cyclohexanone (68), 3- pentanone (62), 2-pentanone 
          (57), 2-hexanone (37), <br>
          4-methyl-2-pentanone (34), 2-heptanone (23), 2-octanone (21).</p>
        <p>Comparatively recently electrochemical amination was used for the production 
          of amino acids from the respective keto acids. Thus, 2-aminophenylacetic 
          acid was obtained with an 88% yield from 2-keto-2-phenylacetic acid 
          at a mercury cathode. Under the same conditions glutamic acid was obtained 
          with a 42% yield and 2-aminobutyric acid with a 48% yield [6]. Analogous 
          reactions were also conducted at platinized platinum and palladium black 
          cathodes [7].</p>
        <p>Thus, researches conducted up to the present time have demonstrated 
          the possibility of realizing the reductive amination of aliphatic and 
          alicyclic ketones with ammonia as aminating agent. The possibility of 
          using primary amines as aminating agents for the synthesis of secondary 
          amines has been investigated very little.</p>
        <p>In the work of Lund [8] it was shown that methylcyclohexylamine was 
          formed during the reduction of cyclohexanol in an aqueous solution of 
          methylamine acidified with hydrochloric acid at a mercury cathode, but 
          its yield was not indicated. In a buffer solution at pH 7 benzylideneaniline, 
          produced by<br>
          the condensation of aniline and benzylideneaniline, produced by the 
          condensation of aniline and benzaldehyde, was reduced at a mercury cathode 
          to the corresponding amine with almost quantitative yield [9]. If the 
          aliphatic ketone is dissolved in anhydrous methylamine containing lithium 
          chloride as supporting electrolyte and the obtained mixture is submitted 
          to hydrolysis after 6 h, N-methylalkylamines are formed with yields 
          amounting to 73% for 2-heptanone, 70% for cyclohexanone, 70% for cyclopentanone, 
          and 52% for diethyl ketone [10].</p>
        <p>However, solutions of lithium chloride in methylamine have very low 
          conductivity, and the method cannot be recommended for practical purposes. 
          The aim of the present investigation was to develop a convenient preparative 
          method for the synthesis of secondary amines starting from aliphatic 
          ketones with the use of readily conducting aqueous solutions.</p>
        <p>It is known that reductive amination takes place in two conjugate stages 
          (1) and (2).</p>
        <p>(1) R1R2C=O + R-NH2 &lt;=&gt; R1R2C=N-R + H2O<br>
          (2) R1R2C=N-R + 2e- + 2H+ =&gt; R1R2CHNHR<br>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to this main reaction, the side reduction of the ketone 
          to a secondary alcohol (3) occurs during electrolysis, and hydrogen 
          is released (4).</p>
        <p>(3) R1R2C=O + 2e- + 2H+ =&gt; R1R2CHOH<br>
          (4) 2H+ + 2e- =&gt; H2</p>
        <p>Since reaction (1) is accelerated by acid-base catalysts, it was to 
          be expected that the whole process would depend substantially on the 
          pH of the medium. Initially the reductive amination process was studied 
          for the amination of 2-butanone by methylamine with the aim of determining 
          its principal relationships. As expected, the yield of the secondary 
          amine depends substantially on the pH of the medium. In weakly acidic 
          and weakly alkaline solutions (pH 5-9) the main electrolysis product 
          is 2-butanol, the amount of which decreases gradually with increase 
          in pH and reaches a minimum at pH 12. At the same time the amount of 
          secondary amine formed increases with increase of the pH and reaches 
          a maximum (60-70%) at pH 12. Further increase in the alkalinity leads 
          to some reduction in the yield of the secondary amine and to an increase 
          in the release of hydrogen. The most marked increase in the yield of 
          the secondary amine starts at pH 10.</p>
        <p>Further experiments showed that the yields of butanol and amine also 
          depend on the amounts of primary amine and ketone taken for electrolysis 
          but to a lesser degree than in the case of the pH value (Table 1).</p>

        <p>A small excess of the primary amine in relation to the ketone assists 
          in the formation of the secondary amine and in reducing the yields of 
          the alcohol and hydrogen. With the methylamine and 2-butanone in a ratio 
          of 1.2:1 the yield of the secondary amine amounts to 64.5%. Departure 
          from this ratio leads to a reduction in the yield of 2-methylaminobutane 
          and to an increase in the current yield of hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Apart from the above-mentioned factors the yield of the electrolysis 
          products also depends on the cathode material (Table 2). The highest 
          yields of the secondary amine (55-60% with respect to current) were 
          obtained at metals with a high hydrogen overpotential (lead, cadmium, 
          and zinc). At mercurized graphite and copper the yields were insignificant, 
          while at tin and graphite reduction hardly occurred at all. The electrode 
          material affects not only the yield of the secondary amine but also 
          the selectivity of the process. At all the tested electrode materials 
          (except tin) 2-butanol was formed in addition to the secondary amine. 
          For the group of metals with a high hydrogen overpotential the highest 
          yield of 2-butanol (15.1%) was observed at the zinc cathode, whereas 
          the yield at cadmium did not exceed fractions of I %. The lowest selectivity 
          for the production of the secondary amine was observed for the copper 
          electrode, at which the yield of 2-butanol amounted to 29% with respect 
          to current with a 10% yield of the secondary amine.</p>

        <p>If the current density is increased, the yield of the secondary amine 
          is reduced, while the yield of the 2-butanol and hydrogen is increased 
          (Fig. 2). Thus, with a current density of 0.019 A/cm2 the secondary 
          amine was obtained with a current yield of about 70.0%, whereas the 
          yield when the current density was increased to 0.159 A/cm2 was 35.0%, 
          i.e., an increase of eight times in the current density reduced the 
          current yield of the secondary amine by half.</p>
        <p>It was interesting to see how the yield of the secondary amine was 
          affected by change in the structure of the primary amine and the ketone. 
          In the series of methyl ketones (aminating agent methylamine) the amount 
          of the respective secondary amine formed decreased somewhat with increase 
          in the<br>
          carbon chain of the substituent at the carbonyl group (Table 3). Whereas 
          the current yield of 2-(N-methylamino)butane amounted to 60.8% for 2-butanone, 
          in the case of 2-hexanone under the same conditions the corresponding 
          secondary amine was formed with a yield of 35.0%. Branching of the chain 
          in the substituent at the carbonyl group or its substitution by a phenyl 
          radical led to a decrease in the yield. In addition to the above-mentioned 
          decrease in the yield of the secondary amines in the<br>
          amination of various ketones there was a general decrease in the reduction 
          rate, as clearly seen from the increase in the yield of hydrogen, which 
          amounted to 20.5% in the amination of 2-butanone, 49.5% in the case 
          of 2-hexanone, and 75.1% in the amination of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone. 
          For<br>
          3-pentanone the yield of the secondary amine amounted to only 18.2% 
          with respect to current, but compared with methyl ketones a significant 
          amount of the alcohol was formed, and its current yield amounted to 
          30.0%</p>
        <p>In contrast to the acyclic ketones, the alicyclic ketones readily form 
          secondary amines during amination by methylainine with good current 
          and material yields (50-70%). Somewhat unexpected results were obtained 
          during the amination of cyclopentanone by cyclopentylamine; in this 
          case the yield of the secondary amine amounted to only 24.8% with respect 
          to current, although the general reduction process took place at a good 
          rate and the current yield of hydrogen was not greater than 25-30%. 
          In the case of the amination of 2-methylcyclopentanone the secondary 
          amines were obtained as two stereoisomeric forms. The l-(N-methylamino)-2-methylcyclopentane 
          formed during amination by methylamine contained 83.2% of the cis and 
          16.5% of the bans isomer. In the reaction with ethylamine the isomeric 
          composition of the obtained secondary amine changes toward an increased 
          amount of the bans form, the content of which in the mixture amounts 
          to 28.3%.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above-mentioned effects of the structure and the 
          size of the carbon radical of the carbonyl compounds on the yield of 
          the secondary amines, a similar relationship was observed during examination 
          of a series of amines. For almost all the ketones in the transition 
          from methylamine to<br>
          ethylamine the yield of the required product decreased (cf. Tables 3 
          and 4) with increase in the number of carbon atoms in the molecule of 
          the primary amine. Such a relationship shows up particularly clearly 
          in the case of the amination of 2-butanone, for which the secondary 
          amines were obtained with yields of 60.8, 51.0, and 43.0% respectively. 
          The presence of a branched chain in the carbon radical or the introduction 
          of a phenyl radical at the alpha position to the amino group led to 
          an even larger decrease in the yield. Thus, during the alkylation of 
          isopropylamine by 2-propanol the required product was formed with a 
          yield of 29-35% with respect to current, while the yield in the case 
          of the alkylation with acetylbenzene was not greater than 15-20%.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the overall reduction rate hardly decreases 
          at all in the transition from lower to higher amines (as can be judged 
          from the yield of hydrogen), but the amount of the respective alcohol 
          increases significantly.</p>
        <p>Like the monoamines, diamines can also be used as aminating agent. 
          For example, during the amination of acetone by hexamethylenediamine 
          we obtained a mixture of the mono- and dialkylated amine with an overall 
          current yield of about 40%.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that the alkylation of the mono-N-alkyl-substituted 
          hexamethylenediamine by acetone takes place with significantly greater 
          difficulty than that of free hexamethylenediamine.</p>
        <p>The relationships we obtained on the effect of various factors on the 
          reductive amination of ketones agree fully with the idea that the process 
          takes place in two stages with previous chemical reaction, expressed 
          by Eqs. (1) and (2). Thus, beginning at pH 10 the amount of amine formed 
          increases sharply, while the amount of alcohol formed decreases at the 
          same time, although the overall reduction rate (judged from the release 
          of hydrogen) remains constant. The observed relationship is clearly 
          due to the change in the concentration of the azomethine in the reaction 
          medium in full agreement with the existing theories about the kinetics 
          of the reactions of carbonyl compounds with bases, according to which 
          the maximum rate is observed at a pH value equal to the pKa value of 
          the base. Under these conditions, according to Eq. (1), half the amount 
          of the primary amine is in the free state. Consequently, the concentration 
          of the free form of the amine increases with increase in the pH value, 
          and this in turn leads to an increase in the formation rate of the azomethine 
          and, finally, to an increase in the yield of the secondary amine.</p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note</b></font><b>:</b> <i>The cathode was

          A/cm2, 18-20C.</i></p>
        <p>The variation in the composition of the electrolysis products with 
          increase in the current density is also due to the concentration of 
          the azomethine, the formation rate of which at a certain value of the 
          current density becomes the controlling stage in the formation of the 
          secondary amine.</p>
        <p>The difference in the formation rates of the azomethines is evidently 
          the main reason for the observed changes in the yields of the secondary 
          amines and the side products in the series of primary amines and ketones 
          with various structures. In this case, however, the occurrence of the 
          side<br>
          reactions is determined by the electrochemical activity of the ketone. 
          In the case of readily reduced ketones with a low azomethine formation 
          rate the process is accompanied by the production of the alcohol, and 
          for difficulty reduced ketones it is accompanied by the release of hydrogen. 
          The amount of alcohol formed increases in the series of tested electrode 
          materials Cd &lt; Pb &lt; Zn &lt; Cu. and this is probably due to the 
          concurrent adsorption of azomethine and ketone.</p>
        <p>The best yields of the secondary amine were obtained for methyl ketones 
          and lower amines, for which the formation rates of the azomethines under 
          the electrolysis conditions were commensurable with their reduction 
          rate or even somewhat exceeded it.</p>
        <p>Increase in the length of the carbon chain and, particularly, its branching 
          (both in the ketones and in the initial amines) lead to a significant 
          reduction in the formation rate of the azomethine and, consequently, 
          to a decrease in the yield of the secondary amine. In view of the fact 
          that the rate of the electrode process depends largely on the rate of 
          the preceding chemical reaction, however, the yield of the secondary 
          amine with respect to current can be increased substantially by reducing 
          the cathodic current density for compounds with low reactivity.</p>

          Experimental</h2>
        <p>The electrolysis products were analyzed by GLC on an LKhM-8MD chromatograph 
          (column length 3 m, helium, 30 cm3/min, stationary phase TNDS-TM, mobile 
          phase octadecyl alcohol 10%, potassium hydroxide 5%).</p>
        <p>The 25% aqueous solution of methylamine, the 42% aqueous solution of 
          ethylamine, the ketones, and the other arnines used in the experiments 
          were of pure and analytical grades. Before the experiments they were 
          distilled, and fractions boiling in a range of 1-2_C were collected. 
          The other<br>
          reagents used for the experiments were of pure and analytical grades. 
          The characteristics of the obtained secondary amines were given in Table 
          5.</p>
        <p>Preparation of Cathodes. Before the experiment the lead electrode was 
          treated two or three times with 5-10% nitric acid, washed with cold 
          water, and brushed. The cadmium electrode was treated two or three times 
          with 5-10% oitric acid and wiped with soda after each treatment. Before 
          the experiment the copper electrode was treated with 10- 15% nitric 
          acid and washed with water. The tin electrode was treated with concentrated 
          hydrochloric acid and washed with water. The graphite cathode was mercurized 
          electrochemically in an acidified solution of mercuric nitrate.</p>
        <p>For electrolysis 90 ml of a 1N solution of disubstituted potassium 
          phosphate and 0.42 mole of the primary amine was loaded into the cathode 
          compartment of a compartmentalized electrolysis cell fitted with a stirrer, 
          a thermometer and a cooling jacket. Concentrated potassium hydroxide 
          solution was added to the obtained mixture to pH 12, and 0.35 mole of 
          the ketone was added. A 40-ml portion of 2596 aqueous phosphoric acid 
          was then added to the anode compartment. Lead electrodes were used as 
          cathode and anode. Electrolysis was conducted by passing the theoretically 
          required amount of electricity and maintaining a temperature of 20-25_C 
          and pH 12 in the catholyte. The cathodic current density was 0.02-0.04 
          A/cm2. For the isolation of the electrolysis products at the end of 
          electrolysis the reaction mass was neutralized to pH 7 with concentrated 
          phosphoric acid, and the obtained solution was extracted with methylene 
          chloride to extract the residual ketone and alcohol. The extracts were 
          dried with magnesium sulfate, the solvent was distilled, and the residue 
          was distilled. The aqueous solution after extraction was saturated with 
          potassium hydroxide. The separated amine layer was removed and further 
          purified with solid potassium hydroxide, after which it was distilled.<br>
