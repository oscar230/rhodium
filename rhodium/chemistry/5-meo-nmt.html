  <h2>5-Methoxy-N-methyltryptamine</h2>
<h4>A New Indole Alkaloid from Phalaris arundinacea </h4>
  <p>J. Chem. Soc. 2079-2081 (1958)</p>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt"> 

  <p>5-Methoxy-N-methyltryptamine and hordenine (p-hydroxyphenethyldimethylamine) 
    have been isolated from reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.).</p>
  <p>A report<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> of the occurrence of &quot; staggers &quot; in sheep confined to 
    pastures in which the perennial grass Phalaris tuberosa predominates led us 
    to investigate the chemical 
    constituents of a species of Phalaris (P. arundinacea L.) growing in the grounds 
    of these laboratories. From this grass, which is free from any fungal parasite, 
    5-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine and hordenine were isolated.</p>
  <p>Whilst hordenine has been found in the seedlings of cereals<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> and in the Cactaceae, 
    Anhalonium and Trichocereus<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, 5-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine 
    is apparently a new naturally-occurring alkaloid and is of interest biogenetically 
    and pharmacologically because of its relation to 5-hydroxytryptamine.</p>

</div>

  <p>Of the series of tryptamines (<strong>I</strong>; R<sub>1</sub>=H or Me, 
    R<sub>2</sub>=H or Me; R<sub>3</sub>=H or OH or OMe), all except (<strong>I</strong>; 
    R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>2</sub>=H, R<sub>3</sub>=OMe) and (<strong>I</strong>; 
    R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>2</sub>=Me, R<sub>3</sub>=OMe) occur naturally<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>3,4</sup></a>, 
    as do dehydrobufotenine (<strong>II</strong>) and bufotenidine (<strong>III</strong>)<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>The total alkaloids from P. arundinacea gave, with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde 
    in 65% v/v sulfuric acid, a green solution which became blue on dilution with 
    water (cf. tryptamine) and with the same reagent in ethanol containing hydrochloric 
    acid, a deep blue, in contrast to gramine and tryptamine which gave pale pink 
    and purple colours, respectively.</p>
  <p>Paper chromatography of the alkaloids (Whatman No. 1 paper) with n-butanol-water-acetic 
    acid (12:5:3), followed by spraying with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 
    cyclohexane and treatment with hydrogen chloride, showed the presence of two 
    indoles, a large blue spot (R<sub>f</sub> = 0.58) and a smaller pink spot (R<sub>f</sub> = 0.70).</p>
  <p>The alkaloids were separated by chromatography on alumina, the course of 
    the separation being followed by paper chromatography and colour reactions. 
    The first runnings contained no indoles but from them hordenine was isolated. 
    The later fractions, yielded a crystalline hydrochloride, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON.HCl 
    (R<sub>f</sub> = 0.58 in the above solvent mixture), containing no phenolic 
    hydroxyl groups and giving a blue colour with sodium nitroprusside and acetone 
    but not with acetaldehyde, characteristic of a secondary amine<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, 
    hence suggesting the structure methoxy-N-methyltryptamine. Comparison of the 
    ultraviolet spectrum with that of tetrahydro-6-methoxycarbazole<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> indicated 
    that the methoxy-group was probably located in the 5-position. Conclusive 
    proof was finally obtained by synthesis of 5-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine, the 
    melting points of the hydrochlorides and the ultraviolet spectra being identical.</p>
  <p>The second, minor, indole alkaloid (R<sub>f</sub> 0.70) has not been identified; although 
    concentrating in the mother liquors from which 5-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine 
    is crystallised, 
    it is present only in small amounts. It is not gramine but on the paper chromatogram 
    it gives the same colour reaction and has the same R<sub>f</sub> as 3-diethylaminomethylindole.</p>

  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  <h4>Extraction</h4>
    <p>Minced grass (4.5 kg) was extracted at 60&deg;C for 5 h with ethanol (45 
      L). After being kept overnight, the liquor was removed by decanting and 
      pressing, and concentrated under reduced pressure to 2L; water (2 L) was 
      added, and the mixture was heated at 60&deg;C for 5 min. and filtered. The 
      pale brown filtrate was saturated with sodium chloride, strongly basified 
      with 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and extracted with chloroform (2x1.5 
      L). The combined chloroform extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated 
      under reduced pressure.</p>
	
	<p>The residue was dissolved in chloroform (10 mL) and chromatographed on 
      alumina (4x20cm); elution was continued with chloroform and 5-mL fractions 
      were collected. Each fraction was tested with: <strong>A:</strong> Millon's 
      reagent, <strong>B:</strong> dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (0.125 g. in 65% 
      sulfuric acid containing 0.1% v/v of 5% ferric chloride solution), <strong>C:</strong> 
      addition of water to the mixture obtained with reagent B, and <strong>D:</strong> 
      ferric chloride solution, with the following results:</p>

    <p>Fractions 4-11 were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, the 
      residue was dissolved in dry ether, and dry hydrogen chloride was passed 
      through the solution. The precipitated hydrochloride was washed with ether 
      and crystallised from alcohol-acetone giving platelets, mp 176-177&deg;C 
      (hordenine hydrochloride<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, mp 176.5-177.5&deg;C) 
      from which the base was obtained as prisms, mp 116-117&deg;C (hordenine,<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
      mp 117-118&deg;C), from aqueous alcohol. It gave a methiodide, mp 228-229&deg;C 
      (prisms from ethanol) (hordenine methiodide,<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
      mp. 229-230&deg;C). Fractions 12-60 were combined and concentrated under 
      reduced pressure and the residue was converted in ether into the hydrochloride, 
      which formed prisms (from ethanol-acetone), mp 165-166&deg;C (mp not depressed 
      on admixture with synthetic 5-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine hydrochloride). 
      The picrate formed orange-red prisms, mp 220-221&deg;C (decomp).</p>
	
  <h4>5-Methoxy-N-p-toluenesulfonyltryptamine</h4>
  
    <p>5-Methoxytryptamine<a href="5-meo-nmt.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> (6 g) in benzene (72 
      mL) was shaken for 1 h with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (7.2 g), potassium 
      hydroxide (3.72 g,), and water (36 mL). After acidification of the solution 
      with hydrochloric acid, the solid was filtered off, washed with water, dried 
      (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and crystallised from benzene, giving plates, 
      mp 123-124&deg;C (8.9 g).</p>
  
  <h4>5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-toluene-p-sulfonyltryptamine</h4>
  
    <p>Interaction of 5-methoxy-N-p-toluenesulfonyltryptamine (6g), ethanol (10 
      mL), 80% aqueous sodium hydroxide (3.6g), and methyl iodide (3.4g) during 
      12 h at room temperature gave prisms (5.5g) (from ethanol), mp 118-119&deg;C.</p>
    <h4>5-Methoxy-N-methyLtryptamine </h4>
  
    <p>The p-toluenesulfonyl derivative (5g) was dissolved in liquid ammonia (200 
      mL) and pellets of sodium were added until the liquid remained blue for 
      some ten min. The colour was discharged by addition of ammonium chloride, 
      the ammonia was evaporated, and the residue dissolved in water (10 mL). 
      The solution was basified with sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with 
      ether. The ether solution was dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and the 
      residue distilled at 150&deg;C/0.05 mmHg (bath temp) to give a pale yellow 
      oil (3 g). Dry hydrogen chloride was passed through its ethereal solution 
      and the precipitate was washed with ether and crystallised from ethanol-acetone, 
      giving prisms, mp 166-167&deg;C.</p>
