<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Secondary amines are obtained in moderate-good yields by reduction of crude imines prepared from
N-alkyltriethoxyiminophosphoranes and aldehydes via the aza-Wittig reaction. N-Alkyltriethoxyiminophosphoranes
are synthesized by one-pot azidation of alkyl bromides followed by Staudinger reaction.</p>
</div>

<p>Significant interest has developed in recent years in the application of iminophosphoranes for various
synthetically useful transformations, especially those affording C=N bond possessing compounds, which are
usually referred to as aza-Wittig reactions<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. Although numerous articles have appeared on the reactions and
synthetic applications of N-alkyl(aryl)triphenyliminophosphoranes<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, the preparative utility of analogous
aza-ylides, viz. N-allyltriethoxyiminophosphoranes is almost unexplored<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. Recently, we reported the one-pot
preparation of N-alkyltriethoxyiminophosphoranes from alkyl bromides by azidation followed by Staudinger
reaction<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> and the application of these compounds for the synthesis of primary amines<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. Herein we describe a
route for the synthesis of secondary amines beginning with the parent alkyl bromides and employing a facile
construction of the final carbon skeleton via the aza-Wittig reaction between N-alkyltriethoxyiminophosphoranes
and aldehydes. Secondary amines are synthesized by the variety of methods, the
reduction of imines being a very convenient and explicit route<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. Difficulties which may be sometimes
encountered in this approach are due to the properties of some imines which are unstable and therefore not
easily accessible in pure state. We decided to overcome this disadvantage by preparing the respective imines
under mild conditions and use them for reduction without isolation and purification. The synthetic protocol
illustrating the construction of secondary amine skeleton from two simple building blocks - alkyl bromide and
aldehyde is presented in the Scheme.</p>

<p>Azidation of alkyl bromides was performed for 3 hours at the reflux temperature of the solvent
system, using a 100% excess of sodium azide. Benzene solution of crude alkyl azides <strong>1</strong> afforded
N-alkyl- triethoxyiminophosphoranes <strong>2</strong> when treated with triethyl phosphite at 25-30°C.</p>

<p>Isolation and purification of these aza-Wittig reagents was neither necessary nor recommended. Neat <strong>2</strong> are
extremely sensitive to traces of moisture and hydrolyze easily to diethyl N-alkylphosphoramidates which may
then contaminate the target compounds. Benzene solution of <strong>2</strong> reacted easily with aliphatic and aromatic
aldehydes to give the imines <strong>3</strong>. If one followed the course of this reaction by <sup>31</sup>P-NMR, the practically
complete conversion of <strong>2</strong> to <strong>3</strong> was observed after 3 hours at room temperature. Due to the exothermic
nature of this reaction, all reactions were started at 0-5°C and then run at 20-25°C.</p>

<p>The crude imines <strong>3</strong> were not isolated but immediately reduced with sodium borohydride in methanol to
form the target secondary amines <strong>4</strong>. The amines were purified by steam distillation and characterized as
corresponding hydrochlorides <strong>5</strong>. This methodology can be used to prepare a number of secondary amines as
shown in Table <strong>1</strong>. The range of substrates in Table <strong>1</strong> demonstrates the clear utility of this synthetic
procedure in preparing a variety of secondary amines in moderate to good yields. Best results were obtained
when benzaldehyde and primary alkyl bromides were used as starting materials. The overall yields of <strong>5</strong> were
inevitably lower (entry <strong>6</strong> and <strong>7</strong>) with easily enolizable butyraldehyde as carbonyl substrate, possibly due to
base-promoted (by strongly basic <strong>2</strong>) aldol condensation as a side reaction.</p>

<p>Although secondary alkyl bromides could be easily converted into the corresponding iminophosphoranes 24,
the aza-Wittig reactions of the latter were totally ineffective (entry <strong>8</strong>).</p>


<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, all solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without
further purification. Aldehydes were freshly distilled before use. Melting points were determined in open capillaries
and are uncorrected. All new compounds gave satisfactory elemental analyses data. Infrared spectra were measured
using a Specord M80 (C. Zeiss) instrument, and NMR spectra were recorded at 80 MHz with a Tesla BS 587FT
spectrometer. All amine hydrochlorides exhibited IR and NMR spectra in accord with the expected structures.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Secondary Amine Hydrochlorides 5; General Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>A suspension of finely powdered sodium azide (6.5 g, 0.1 mol) in the mixture of alkyl bromide (0.05 mol),
benzene (15 mL), and dimethylformamide (15 mL) was refluxed gently with stirring for 3 h. In the case of allyl
bromide azidation should be carried out at 35-40°C for 6 h. The product was cooled to room temperature and
poured into cold water (200 mL). The organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with benzene
(3x15 mL); the extracts were combined with the organic phase, dried (MgSO4), and filtered. Triethyl
phosphite (8.3 g, 0.05 mol) was added dropwise with stirring to a benzene solution of crude alkyl azide <strong>1</strong>. The
temperature of the slightly exothermic reaction was kept at 25-30°C for 4 h and the product was left overnight
at room temperature. Benzene solution of N-alkyltriethoxyiminophosphorane <strong>2</strong> such prepared was added dropwise
with stirring and occasional external cooling (ice-water bath) to a solution of freshly distilled aldehyde
(0.05 mol) in benzene (5 mL) at 0-5°C. After the addition had been completed the mixture was stirred for 3 h
at 20-25°C. Benzene solution of crude imine <strong>3</strong> was then evaporated under reduced pressure end the residue was
diluted with methanol (100 mL). Sodium borohydride (1.9 g, 0.05 mol) was added portion-se with stirring to the
resultant solution and the temperature was kept below 30°C. The mixture was then left at room temperature far
24 h, evaporated under reduced pressure and diluted with water (50 mL). The solution was made strongly
alkaline With an excess of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide and steam distilled. The distillate was acidified with
25% hydrochloric avid and evaporated to dryness. Crude amine hydrochloride <strong>5</strong> was dried in vacuo over P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and
crystallized from the suitable solvent (see Table <strong>1</strong>). When the amine could not be distilled with steam (entry <strong>1</strong>)
the crude reduction product after evaporation of methanol was steam distilled to remove volatile contaminants.</p>

<p>The residue was made alkaline and extracted with ether (3x50 ml). The extracts were evaporated, the
residue was treated with 25% hydrochloric acid (10 mL), and evaporated to dryness to give crude <strong>5</strong>. Analytically
pure samples were obtained by recrystallization from ethanol-ether unless otherwise stated (see Table <strong>1</strong>).</p>

<h2>One-Pot Conversion Of Alkyl Bromides Into Imines<br>Via The Staudinger Reaction</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>A new one-pot procedure for transforming primary alkyl bromides into the corresponding imines via the 
Staudinger reaction has been developed. Acetonitrile was found to be an excellent solvent for azidation as 
well as the reaction of organic azide with triphenylphosphine and a carbonyl compound.</p>
</div>

<p>It is well known that reaction of azides with tertiary phosphines gives iminophosphoranes<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, useful 
intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of nitrogen compounds<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> including imines<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. As part of our 
program on the photochemistry of some allyl imines, we directed our efforts toward their efficient 
preparation. Now we wish to report an effective one-pot synthesis of imines directly from alkyl bromides via 
azide intermediates under the conditions of the Staudinger reaction in acetonitrile.</p>

<p>The literature reports a great number of procedures for the synthesis of alkyl azides by the nucleophilic 
substitution of bromide with sodium azide<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. To obtain a corresponding imine, isolated alkyl azides are 
generally treated with triphenylphosphine and a carbonyl compound in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene<a href="aza-wittig.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
Those procedures are usually too complex and so we decided to find a short, simple, and efficient method.</p>

</div>

<p>Acetonitrile was found to be a very practical solvent in both steps: azidation and imine formation. Thus, 
both steps were combined without necessity to isolate and purify any intermediate (<strong>Scheme 1</strong>). Reactive primary 
bromides were refluxed with an excess of sodium azide in acetonitrile. Sodium bromide and the remaining sodium 
azide were easily filtered off from the cooled reaction mixture because both salts are insoluble in cold 
acetonitrile. Since aliphatic nonyl bromide did not afford nonyl azide under those conditions, a small amount 
of water or a phase-transfer catalyst were used to enhance the reactivity. The presence of a phase-transfer 
catalyst raised the conversion, however, the reaction time was too long (over 50 hours). Reflux of the 
acetonitrile solution with triphenylphosphine and an aldehyde afforded the corresponding imine in a very high 
yield and purity (<strong>Table 1</strong>). Reaction of cinnamyl bromide provided imine with only 70% purity - some unidentified 
byproducts were formed. When ketone instead of aldehyde was used a longer reaction time in the second step was 
applied bat the conversion was still too low.</p>

<img src="pictures/space/8x8.gif" width="650" height="1" border="0">
<p>The described one-pot procedure offers relatively high overall yields and thus may serve as an helpful 
sequence in many procedures whom the synthesis of imines is anticipated.</p>


<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Synthesis of N-Benzyl-N-(phenylmethylidene)amine 1.</h4>

<p>A stirred mixture of benzyl bromide (2.0 g, 11.7 mmol) and sodium azide (1.0 g, 15.2 mmol) in dry acetonitrile 
(30 ml) was refluxed for 3 h and then cooled to 20°C Solid sodium bromide and remaining sodium azide were 
removed by filtration and the benzyl azide solution was used in the next step without further purification.</p>

<p>Triphenylphosphine (2.8&nbsp;g, 10-5 mmol) was added and the solution was refluxed for 1&nbsp;h. Freshly distilled 
benzaldehyde (1.1g, 10.5 mmol) was then added into the mixture and reflux continued for 2&nbsp;h. Acetonitrile was 
evaporated in vacuo and the residue was triturated twice with dry hexane (2x40&nbsp;mL). The solid that precipitated 
(triphenylphosphine oxide) was removed by filtration and concentration in vacuo gave imine <strong>1</strong>. The analytically 
pure imine was obtained by distillation (<em>Kugelrohr</em>).</p>

<p>Compounds <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, and <strong>5</strong> were prepared according to this procedure from the corresponding bromides and 
aldehydes. Synthesis of imine <strong>4</strong> was same as above besides that the acetonitrile solution was refluxed for 48 h 
after the addition of acetophenone.</p>

<h4>Synthesis of N-Nonyl-N-(phenylmethylidene)amine 6.</h4>

<p>A stirred mixture of nonyl bromide (2.0 g, 9.7 mmol) and sodium azide (0.8 g, 12.6 mmol) in a mixture of 
acetonitrile (27 ml) and water (3 ml) was refluxed for 12 h. and then cooled to 20°C. The water layer was 
removed and the acetonitrile solution was dried with sodium sulfate. The filtered solution was used in the 
next step without further purification and was treated with triphenylphosphine and benzaldehyde in the same 
way as that described in the first procedure.</p>
