This book was written for the enlightenment of the general public or at least the open minded and curious percentage. <br>It is to be used
for informational purposes only. It is not meant to be a production manual. All the syntheses are geared to demonstrate how the underground
chemist might proceed in "secretly" manufacturing MDMA. Some of these methods are in fact being used to feed the growing underground market
right now.

<br><br>

Many of the syntheses contained in this book are dangerous. An effort has been made to point out those dangers, but the reader is referred
to any manual on laboratory safety for more detailed coverage.

<br><br>

Many of the syntheses given in this book would never have been used by the professional chemist, because he would have the chemicals readily
available from chemical supply houses. Many chemicals are also available to the average person, but the DEA uses open purchasing to entrap
many unsuspecting customers. For this reason, an underground chemist's best move is to produce as many of his own precursors as possible.
There are quite a number of possibilities to be had from normal household, garden, paint, sealant and OTC medical products. Routinely
reading labels of these products will provide most of the information one needs. Cross-checking the ingredients on the labels with a
dictionary of chemical synonyms or trade name index will help clear up any ambiguity in naming schemes. The reader can always obtain more
information by referring to the original articles cited and general references given at the end of chapter one. Reading through chapters
one and two first will help make the terminology in the rest of the book much clearer.

<br><br>

Many professional people are pursuing legal routes in an effort to legalize this wonderful substance. <a href="http://www.maps.org">MAPS</a>,
The Multidisciplinary Society for Psychedelic Studies, founded by Rick Doblin is a non-profit organization dedicated to MDMA research. MAPS
associated psychiatrists petitioned the FDA for approval to administer MDMA to research subjects. They have already won some ground and
conducted research, but the fight goes on. The process and research is very expensive and all membership dues go to the effort. If you
would like to join ($30) and recieve their newsletter or make a tax deductible contribution, contact MAPS at 23-A Shalter Lane, Cambridge,
MA, 02138.

<br><br>

The spelling of the name Ecstacy has been questioned by some who prefer the dictionary spelling of Ecstasy which means intense joy or
delight. I use Ecstacy because we are not talking about manufacturing intense joy or delight, but instead, a drug whose slang name is
Ecstacy and may produce intense joy or delight.
