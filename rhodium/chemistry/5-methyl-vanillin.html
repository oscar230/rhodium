<p>In connection with our synthesis of analogs of serotonin neurotoxins<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> we needed access to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methylbenzaldehyde (<strong>1</strong>) in quantities. The only previous method<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> for the synthesis of <strong>1</strong> involved conversion of o-vanillin to 2-hydroxy-3-methoxytoluene followed by formylation using CHCl<sub>3</sub>/NaOH in 12% overall yield. We thought a more efficient process would result if we could introduce a methyl group selectively in the position ortho to the hydroxyl group of vanillin (<strong>2</strong>). However, no direct and selective method for introducing a methyl group into a benzene ring containing a hydroxyl as well as an aldehyde group has been described in the literature. In this paper we describe the development of a method for the synthesis of <strong>1</strong> from vanillin (<strong>2</strong>) without requiring the protection of either the hydroxyl or the aldehyde function and demonstrate the generality of such a method.</p>

</div>

<p>In devising the present method we took advantage of the selectivity and the high yield that can often be realized in the Mannich reaction of phenols<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. Thus in the first step in the synthesis of <strong>1</strong> from <strong>2</strong>, the methyl group equivalent, dimethylaminomethyl group, was introduced in vanillin in 86% yield to give crystalline Mannich base <strong>3</strong>. Previous methods for the synthesis of C-methylated phenols from phenolic Mannich bases have involved catalytic hydrogenolysis of the Mannich base itself<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, its hydrochloride salt<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> or its acetolysis product<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> (cf. <strong>4</strong>) and NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN reduction of the methiodide of the Mannich base<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. None of these procedures, due to their incompatibility with the aldehyde function, could be applied to the conversion of <strong>3</strong> to <strong>1</strong>. </p>

<p>We next considered the conversion of the dimethylaminomethyl group of <strong>3</strong> to a methyl group equivalent that can be reduced to a methyl group in the presence of a free aldehyde function. The chloromethyl group appeared to be such a group based on Sandin and Fieser's<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> observation that the iodomethyl group of 9-methyl-10-iodomethyl-1,2-benzanthracene can be converted to a methyl group using SnCl<sub>2</sub> in conc. HCl. </p>

<p>For the synthesis of the chloromethyl derivative<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> <strong>5</strong>. Mannich base <strong>3</strong> was first treated with excess acetic anhydride under reflux to give the diacetate <strong>4</strong>. Without its isolation, but after the removal of excess acetic anhydride, the diacetate <strong>4</strong> was treated with conc. HCl at ambient temperature for 1.5 h to generate the chloromethyl derivative <strong>5</strong> which precipitated out of the reaction mixture. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of the crude precipitate suggested it to be <strong>5</strong>, however, due to its instability, an analytical sample could not be prepared. The chloromethyl derivative, in turn, without its isolation was reacted with SnCl<sub>2</sub>&middot;2 H<sub>2</sub>O in a mixture of conc. HCl and p-dioxane under reflux for 30 min to give, after sublimation of the crude product, the desired C-methylated product <strong>1</strong> in 85% yield based on the Mannich base.</p>

<p>To determine the generality of the procedure, we studied three other examples (<strong>Eq. 1-3</strong>). In each case the Mannich base was converted to the corresponding C-methylated derivative without the isolation of the intermediate acetolysis product (cf. <strong>4</strong>) or the chloromethyl derivative (cf. <strong>5</strong>). These examples show that the method is suitable for the introduction of the methyl group para to the hydroxyl group (<strong>Eq. 1-2</strong>) and also suitable for <em>bis</em>-C-methylation (<strong>Eq. 2-3</strong>).</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><strong>5-Dimethylaminomethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (2)</strong></p>

<p>To a stirred solution of 37% aqueous CH<sub>2</sub>O (120 g, 1.5 mol) and 40% aqueous Me<sub>2</sub>NH (180 g, 1.5 mol) in 900 mL of EtOH was added vanillin (<strong>2</strong>, 152 g, 1 mol). The mixture was refluxed for 30 min, stirred at 25°C for 24 h and then refrigerated overnight. The white granular solid was collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold acetone and then dried under vacuum to give 179.8 g (86%) of <strong>3</strong>: mp 139-141°C.</p> 
<strong><p>4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methylbenzaldehyde (1)</p></strong>

<p>A solution of the Mannich base <strong>3</strong> (104.5 g, 500 mmol), in 500 mL of Ac<sub>2</sub>O was refluxed for 24 h protected from moisture. Volatile materials were removed by distillation (bp 55-80°C) under aspirator vacuum. After cooling the residue (which was the crude diacetate <strong>4</strong>) to ~40°C, 500 mL of conc. HCl was added gradually and then the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1.5 h by which time most of the chloromethyl derivative <strong>5</strong> had precipitated. Enough p-dioxane (~400 mL) was added to ensure dissolution of the solid at 60-70°C. Then with efficient (mechanical) stirring 337.5 g (1.5 mol) of SnCl<sub>2</sub>·2 H<sub>2</sub>O was added and the mixture was refluxed for 30 min. After cooling to 25°C and dilution with 200 mL conc. HCl, the mixture was extracted with CHCl<sub>3</sub> (5 x 150 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with 6 N HCl, water, 10% NaCl solution and then evaporated in vacuo to dryness. The crude residue was adsorbed on silica gel (63-200 mesh, 70 g) by adding silica gel to a solution of the crude in CHCl<sub>3</sub> and then evaporating the solvent in vacuo. A slurry of the mixture in CHCl<sub>3</sub> was then applied on a column of silica gel (100 g) and eluted with ether-hexane (2:1). Evaporation of eluents followed by sublimation (0.1 mm, 120°C) of the grey solid residue gave 70.6 g (85%) of <strong>1</strong> as a white granular solid: mp 99-101°C (lit.<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> mp 99-100°C).
</p>

<p><strong>5-Dimethylaminomethyl-2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>7</strong>) was prepared from o-vanillin (<strong>6</strong>, 3 g) as described for <strong>3</strong> except that reflux was carried out for 4 h and then the mixture was evaporated in vacuo to dryness. The residue was triturated with Et<sub>2</sub>O whereby a light yellow solid was formed which was thoroughly washed with Et<sub>2</sub>O and dried (yield 78%): mp 110-112°C; mp of HCl salt 170-172°C (lit.<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> mp 169-172°C).
</p>
<p><strong>2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methylbenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>8</strong>) was produced from <strong>7</strong> (2.8 g) in 63% yield: mp 74-76°C (lit.<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> mp 76°C).
</p>
<p><strong>3,5-<em>Bis</em>(dimethylaminomethyl)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>10</strong>) was prepared from <strong>9</strong> (4 g) as described for <strong>7</strong> except that three equivalents each of CH<sub>2</sub>O and Me<sub>2</sub>NH were used and was isolated as an oil (87%).
</p>
<p><strong>3,5-Dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>11</strong>) was produced from <strong>10</strong> (3.8 g) using six equivalents of SnCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O at the reduction step, in 55% yield: mp 12-14°C (lit.<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> mp 12-14°C).</p>

<p><strong>3,5-<em>Bis</em>(dimethylaminomethyl)-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>13</strong>) was prepared from <strong>12</strong> (4 g), as described above for <strong>10</strong>, as a syrup in 83% yield.</p>

<p><strong>3,5-Dimethyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>14</strong>) was prepared from <strong>13</strong> (3.8 g) as described above for <strong>11</strong> in 63% yield: mp 113-115°C (lit.<a href="5-methyl-vanillin.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> mp 114-115°C).</p>
