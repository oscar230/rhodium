<H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>The hitherto pretty unknown pseudonitrosites are nitrogenous compounds which are formed by the action of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (an equimolar mixture of 
NO and NO<sub>2</sub>) upon etheral solutions of some unsaturated compounds, for example propenylbenzenes and styrenes. They were popular in the late 
1800s and early 1900s, but has since then been forgotten(?). After around WWII, there is not a single mention of them in the literature, 
not even in such a reference work on the subject as <I>Nitroalkenes - Conjugated Nitro Compounds</I><a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>


<p>The pseudonitrosites were discovered by Toennies around 1880, when he made the pseudonitrosite of anethol, but he failed to recognize 
the constitution of the compound, and mistakenly assigned it the structure of a vicinal ketoxime/nitrite. In the early 1890s, the Italian 
chemist Angelo Angeli experimented with different allyl- and propenylbenzenes, and again encountered the pseudonitrosites, but he couldn't 
either determine their exact structure, and with the methods used in analytical chemistry back then, this is understandable. In the early 
1900s, the puzzle was solved by studies on styrene pseudonitrosite, and around this time Wallach and Wieland published reviews of 
pseudonitrosite chemistry<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>2-3</sup></a>. Very little about pseudonitrosites can be found in Chemical Abstracts, so most pointers to earlier work
must be retrieved from the references cited in those articles.</p> 

<p>In the 1930's, Victor Bruckner began to explore the possibility of using pseudonitrosites as an intermediate in the synthesis of 
substituted 1-phenyl-2-amino-propanols, and in his articles he also included improved syntheses of several pseudonitrosites from 
propenylbenzenes, as well as studies on the pseudonitrosites themselves. One of the most useful reactions he investigated was the 
basic hydrolysis of propenylbenzene pseudonitrosites, yielding the corresponding beta-nitro derivatives of the propenylbenzenes. This 
route offered several advantages over the known nitration of alkenes with tetranitromethane, which is expensive, toxic and explosive. 
In his papers on pseudonitrosites, Bruckner described several experiments with asarone<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, methylisoeugenol and isosafrole<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, isoeugenol<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> and anethole<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. In the experimental part below, some freely translated parts of his work is included.</p>

<H3>Theory</H3> 

<p>Several methods for the synthesis of pseudonitrosites have been used, such as bubbling N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> through a solution
of the propenylbenzenes in ether, slow addition of a NaNO<sub>2</sub> solution to a solution of the propenylbenzene in 
glacial acetic acid (Toennies' method), as well as dripping a dilute solution of sulfuric acid into a two-phase 
solution of NaNO<sub>2</sub> in water and a propenylbenzene in ether (Bruckner's method). </p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/nitrous1.gif">
<p><b>Fig 2.</b> N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from NaNO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The action of a strong acid (such as sulfuric acid) on sodium nitrite gives the sodium salt of the strong acid, as well as free nitrous 
acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>), which in turn breaks down to an equimolar mixture of NO and NO<sub>2</sub> gas <i>(see Fig. 2)</i>. This gas mixture is in equilibrium 
with dinitrogen trioxide: <b>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> &larr;&rarr; NO + NO<sub>2</sub></b></p>

<p>At 25°C and normal pressure, only about 10% of the gas is in the form of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the equilibrium mixture behaves just like as if it 
was a mixture of NO and NO<sub>2</sub>. But, for the sake of simplicity, the equilibrium mixture is commonly called N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or dinitrogen trioxide.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/nitrous2.gif">
<p><b>Fig 3.</b> N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from HNO<sub>3</sub> and iron</p>
</div>

<p>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can also be formed by the action of nitric acid (which in turn can be made by dissolving NaNO<sub>3</sub> or KNO<sub>3</sub> in conc H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) on certain 
metals, for example iron <i>(see Fig. 3)</i>. The more finely divided the metal, the faster generation of gas. But there is a downside to 
this method. In the beginning the nitric acid is concentrated, but as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is evolved, the solution becomes more and more dilute. There 
is a problem associated with this, the ratio of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> isn't constant if the concentration of the acid changes. Concentrated acid 
gives excess NO<sub>2</sub>, and a dilute acid solution gives excess NO. To get maximum yields out of the treated propenylbenzene, the proportions 
between NO and NO<sub>2</sub> should always be as close to 1:1 as possible, and only the sodium nitrite method will constantly produce a gas mixture 
with just those proportions. Producing dinitrogen trioxide with the nitrate method is therefore discouraged. This method does not work at 
all with asarone (only with other propenylbenzenes, such as isosafrole or anethole) according to Bruckner<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<p><b>Fig 4.</b> Dimerization of Asarone Pseudonitrosite</p>
</div>

<p>The pseudonitrosites always dimerizes to the <em>bis</em>-pseudonitrosites, all of which are practically insoluble in water, alcohols and most 
common organic solvents, with the exception of warm chloroform or ethyl acetate, in which a blue-green solution is produced, consisting of 
the dissociated pseudonitrosite <b>monomer</b>. During the treatment of a propenylbenzene with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the intensely colored free monomer can 
be observed for a while before it dimerizes to its crystalline form. The colors of the crystalline pseudonitrosites varies, from the 
snow-white isosafrole or anethole derivatives to the canary-yellow one obtained from asarone. Upon storage, pseudonitrosites soon decompose 
with discoloration, releasing nitrogen oxides and hydrogen cyanide. At around 40°C decomposition takes place in less than one day. </p>

</div>

<p>Treatment of the pseudonitrosite dimer with four moles of an inorganic base (such as KOH in alcohol), produces two moles of potassium 
hyponitrite (K<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and two moles of the water-soluble potassium salt of the corresponding nitroalkene. Acidification of the potassium 
salt solution with dilute acid precipitates the water-insoluble phenyl-2-nitropropene as fine crystals, and the liberated hyponitrous acid 
breaks down into water and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), which can be observed as fine bubbles that is being evolved during this step. </p>

<p>The reaction of a pseudonitrosite with acetic anhydride produces the <em>alpha</em>-acetoxy derivative with release of N<sub>2</sub>O, and after reduction of 
the nitro group this could be hydrolyzed to ring substituted phenylpropanolamine derivatives. Basic hydrolysis of the alpha-acetoxy 
derivative also produces the phenyl-2-nitropropene. Reaction of pseudonitrosites with primary amines yields secondary <em>alpha</em>-amino 
derivatives.</p>

<h4>Pseudonitrosites<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>4,5,7</sup></a></h4>

<p>A solution of 1 mole (69 grams) of sodium nitrite in 100 ml water was prepared in a 500 ml flask, and a solution of 0.1 moles of a freshly 
distilled propenylbenzene (20.8g asarone, 16.2g isosafrole or 14.8g anethole) in 150 ml of diethyl ether was added. During a period 
of 3-4 hours, a 20% solution of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (prepared by cautiously adding 0.5 moles (49 grams) of conc. sulfuric acid to 200 ml of H<sub>2</sub>O) was added 
dropwise with magnetic stirring, preferably through a pressure- equalized addition funnel. Watch the addition rate so that the temperature 
of the two-phase solution doesn't rise over room temp, and this solution can preferably be cooled during the addition  In the beginning of 
the addition of acid, monomeric pseudonitrosite can be seen in the etheral layer. The monomer derived from asarone is greenish, anethol 
blueish and isosafrole yellow. If oxygen gets into the system during the addition, formed NO oxidizes to brown NO<sub>2</sub> gas, which can lower 
the yield of pseudonitrosite. After the addition, the solution was allowed to stir for an hour or two, whereafter the solution was filtered 
with suction, and the precipitate washed with 50ml each of water, denatured alcohol and finally ether. After sucked as dry as possible, the 
pseudonitrosite crystals was allowed to air dry on a filter paper.</p>

<p>Pseudonitrosites cannot be stored, as they begin to decompose within hours at room temperature with the evolution of nitrogen oxides, 
and should be further processed to for example the very useful phenyl-2-nitropropenes, which upon reduction can yield phenylacetones 
and amphetamine derivatives.</p> 

<h4>Phenyl-2-nitropropenes<a href="pseudonitrosite.html#refs"><sup>4,5,7</sup></a></h4>

<p>0.1 mole of the corresponding propenylbenzene pseudonitrosites (28.5g asarone, 23.8g isosafrole or 22.4g anethole) was dissolved in 
150ml 8% alcoholic KOH with shaking, and possibly light heating (not over 30°C, especially not in the case of asarone pseudonitrosite, 
or there is a risk of decomposition (to the aldehyde, amongst other things). Caution: Foaming with evolution of N<sub>2</sub>O will occur. 
The cloudy solution was suction filtered, and the filtrate was poured onto 100 grams of crushed ice. The solution was acidified with 
dilute HCl and was stirred occasionally until the ice had melted. The precipitate of nitropropene was filtered off, washed with a little 
cold water and air dried. </p>
