<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>A variety of aromatic compounds have been converted to aldehydes via a facile formylation process employing hexamethylenetetramine and trifluoroacetic acid.</p>
</div>

  <p>In the Duff reaction,<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>1-3</sup></a> hexamethylenetetramine 
    (HMTA) is employed, usually with glyceroboric acid, to convert highly activated 
    aromatic compounds to their formyl derivatives. The process is quite limited 
    in scope, having been most widely used in the conversion of phenols to o-hydroxybenzaldehyde 
    derivatives. The required conditions are rigorous, and the yields are generally 
    low.</p>

<div class="pic right">

</div>

  <p>When the hexamethylenetetramine is used in conjunction with trifluoroacetic 
    acid, a variety of aromatic compounds, including simple hydrocarbons, can 
    be converted to imine products which are transformed to the aryl aldehydes 
    on hydrolysis (<strong>eq 1</strong>). The required conditions are mild, and 
    good yields of pure products can be easily isolated. A high order of para 
    regioselectivity is exhibited.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

  <p>Thus, a mixture of 12.2 g of 2,6-xylenol (100 mmol), 14.0 g of hexamethylenetetramine 
    (100 mmol), and 150 ml of trifluoroacetic acid was heated at reflux (83-90°C) 
    for 12 hr. The products were concentrated and combined with 600 ml of ice 
    water; the resultant mixture was stirred for 15 min, made basic with Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 
    and extracted with ether. Evaporation of the ether solution left a yellow 
    solid which was recrystallized from chloroform-pentane to afford 14.3 g (95% 
    yield) of 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, mp 111-112.5°C (lit.<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 
    mp 113-114°C).</p>

</div>

<p>The data for a number of these transformations are summarized in Table I.</p>

<p>Methylimine derivatives are immediate precursors of the aldehydes. When the reaction products derived from toluene were subjected to rapid hydrolytic workup, the p- and o-toluimines CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH=N-CH<sub>3</sub> were obtained in predominance to the carbonyl compounds. Whether such products are formed by rearrangement of the methyleneimines ArCH<sub>2</sub>N=CH<sub>2</sub> or arise in exchange reactions involving methylamine remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Other kinds of intermediates are isolable when both heating and hydrolysis 
    are avoided. Thus, the 2,6-xylenol-hexamethylenetetramine-trifluoroacetic 
    acid system when kept below 30°C for 3 hr yielded a complex mixture from which 
    the dibenzylammonium salt<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> 1 (41%) and the hexaminium 
    salt<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> 2 (15%) were isolated after evaporation 
    of the acid and fractional crystallization of the residue from acetonitrile-ether. 
    No unalkylated 2,6-xylenol was recovered. The formation of 2 makes evident 
    the relationship of this process to the Sommelet<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
    and Delépine<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> reactions, both of which are based 
    on transformation of N-benzyl derivatives of hexamethylenetetramine. Experiments 
    with the trifluoroacetic acid system aimed at an illumination of these mechanistically 
    obscure<a href="formylation.duff-hmta-tfa.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> facets of hexamethylenetetramine chemistry 
    are in progress.</p>
