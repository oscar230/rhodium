<h2>Future Synthetic Drugs of Abuse</h2>
<h5>by Donald A. Cooper, DEA</h5>
<p>HTML by Rhodium</p>

<div class="stdtxt"> 

<p>It seems likely that primitive man wished at times to escape his reality 
    and most probably found some natural drug to facilitate this desire. In fact, 
    abuse of the coca leaf and the opium poppy is thought to have been practiced 
    for at least the last 3400 years<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>96,123</sup></a> 
    and the use of peyote may have been known as early as 1000 BC<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>129,130</sup></a>. Perhaps due in part to the long history of opiate 
    products, one of the first derivatives of a natural drug to be used pharmaceutically 
    was heroin. The acceptance of heroin as a pharmaceutical was primal in establishing 
    the concept that certain structural modifications of physiologically active 
    compounds can result in new compounds which cause biological responses which 
    are not only similar, but are enhanced as compared to those of the parent 
    compounds. Other works such as the structural elucidation of mescaline and 
    the preparation of N-methyl and N-acetyl derivatives of mescaline has served 
    to strengthen this concept and to broaden the scope of permissible derivatives<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>143</sup></a>. In the ensuing years much knowledge 
    has been gained regarding biologically useful derivatives of the naturally 
    occurring drugs but, most importantly, the structures of the alkaloids and 
    the protoalkaloids have, one by one, been elucidated. This knowledge has then 
    allowed researchers of recent times to deduce many of the structure relationships 
    associated with specific biological responses. The sum of this hard-won knowledge 
    allows one to produce pharmaceutically useful compounds, which have no counterpart 
    in nature, from off the shelf chemicals. Unfortunately there are those people 
    who would take this body of knowledge and, rather than use it for the enhancement 
    of medical science, use it for their own financial gain. Individuals such 
    as these have created the so-called designer drug phenomenon.</p>

<p>Henderson<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>57</sup></a>  first described a synthetic drug 
    as one which was designed by a clandestine chemist to produce a certain pharmacological 
    response. However, today designer drugs are universally understood to belong 
    to a group of clandestinely produced drugs which are structurally and pharmacologically 
    very similar to a controlled substance but are not themselves controlled substances<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>95</sup></a>. The Drug Enforcement 
    Administration (DEA) has noted that the designer drug terminology tends to 
    cast a somewhat glamorous aura onto the concept, and as a result, the DEA 
    feels that it would be wise to refer to these compounds in some other manner 
    and suggests the use of the term Controlled Substance Analogs (CsA).</p>

<p>In October of 1987 the United States Government amended the Controlled Substance 
    Act in an effort to curtail the illicit introduction of new CsA's. This amendment 
    states that any new drug which is substantially similar to a controlled substance 
    currently listed under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Schedule I or 
    II, and has either pharmacological properties similar to a Schedule I or II 
    substance or is represented as having those properties, shall also be considered 
    a controlled substance and will be placed in Schedule I. The amendment further 
    contains provisions which exempt the legitimate researcher as well as compounds 
    that are already being legally marketed from the provisions of the amendment.</p>

<p>Since the CsA amendment has yet to be tested in a court of law, it is much too early to say how successful it will be 
in limiting the spread of the CsA phenomena. However, it is safe to assume that there will be those who believe that they 
can manage to evade the provisions of the CsA amendment, and much of the world has not yet even attempted to find a 
litigious solution to the problem of CsA's. Therefore, an attempt to identify those CsA's which would be logical candidates 
for synthesis by a clandestine chemist is still a pertinent exercise.</p>

<H3>Hallucinogens</H3>

<p>A great many compounds, when taken in sufficient quantity, will alter one's perception of reality. For the purposes of 
this paper, the term hallucinogen is reserved for those compounds that are characterized by the predominance of their 
actions on mental and psychic functions<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Hallucinogens can be classified according to structural similarities into four groups of compounds and into one group 
containing miscellaneous structures. The classifications are: indoles, phenylalkylamines, piperidyl benzilate esters, 
cannabinoids and miscellaneous.</p>

  <p>The piperidyl benzilate esters have been extensively studied and relationships 
between psychotomimetic activity and chemical structure have been established<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>1,2</sup></a>. 
The N-methyl and N-ethyl-3-piperidyl benzilate esters are controlled substances and are 
listed under the CFR Schedule I as hallucinogens. Benactyzine is a noncontrolled 
drug which is used medically as an antagonist to cholinergic nerve fibers<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>. It appears that the pharmacological 
effects of the piperidyl benzilate esters may not be conducive to a good trip 
for the user. Brown describes the pharmacological effects by explaining how 
thought processes are severely disrupted. He reports that speech is disorganized 
and incoherent, and that confusion, disorientation, and amnesia occur often 
and may be long lasting<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a>. Perhaps these 
compounds should not be classified as hallucinogens but rather as incapacitating 
agents. Additionally, although the pharmacological effects of the piperidyl 
benzilates have been compared to those elicited by phencyclidine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>134</sup></a>, there is no evidence to suggest any significant abuse 
of these compounds. Therefore, no further discussion will be given to the 
piperidyl-benzilate esters.</p>

<p>Given the world wide ready availability of marijuana, it is somewhat difficult 
    to produce a viable argument for making CsA's of cannabinoids. However, ten 
    years ago (1978) an attempt to produce CsA's from cannabis extracts was encountered 
    in the Jacksonville, Florida area. In this case a concentrated extract of 
    cannabis had been obtained by a soxhlet extraction. The extract had been acetylated 
    with acetic anhydride, and in the final step, the excess acetic anhydride 
    removed by distillation (reference is unretrievable due to its appearance 
    in an underground periodical). The product contained neither quantities of 
    nonderivatized cannabinoid nor any identifiable plant fragments Since this 
    single instance, no acetalaced cannabinoid samples have been reported by a 
    DEA laboratory. Therefore, this instance is assumed to represent an isolated 
    occurrence and as such, will serve to terminate our discussion of cannabinoid 
    CsA's.</p>

<p>Under the heading miscellaneous, one must include nearly any ingestible compound 
    known to man, as any substance taken at toxic levels will alter one's perception 
    of reality. Obviously a discussion of all such compounds as models for CsA 
    hallucinogens is not within the scope of this article. However, the compound 
    known as phencyclidine (PCP or N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine), although 
    developed by Parke Davis and Company (Rochester, Michigan) as an anesthetic, 
    does produce psychotomimetic effects and is widely abused in the United States. 
    It is listed in the CFR under Schedule II, and two of its homologs and one 
    analog are listed under Schedule I.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the following discussions, the indoles, the phenylalkylamines and PCP will be considered as possible candidates for hallucinogenic CsA's.</p>
   
   <h3>Indoles</h3>

<p>The literature covering indole chemistry is huge and diverse. Over 500 naturally 
    occurring indole alkaloids were known by 1972 and accounted for nearly one 
    fourth of all alkaloids known at that time<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>120</sup></a>. 
    By 1980, the number of known indole alkaloids had risen to approximately 1200<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a>. Today there have been 
    many more indoles added to the list of naturally occurring alkaloids. These 
    alkaloids include such pharmacologically and structurally diverse compounds 
    as tryptophan (essential amino acid), reserpine (tranquilizer), strychnine 
    (stimulant-convulsant) harmaline (hallucinogen), serotonin (anticholinesterase 
    and monoamine oxidase inhibitor), ergometrine (oxytocic), vinblastine (antitumor 
    agent), and psilocybin (hallucinogen).</p> 

<p>Only nine compounds containing the indole nucleus are controlled substances 
    under the United States Federal Statutes. Three of these compounds are classified 
    as ergot alkaloids, five are simple 3-(2-ethylamino)-indoles, and one is the 
    pentacyclic alkaloid, ibogaine. The ergot alkaloids are lysergic acid, lysergic 
    acid amide, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The five controlled indolealkylamines 
    are N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET), N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine 
    (bufotenine), N,N-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-tryptamine (psilocin), and the phosphate 
    ester of N,N-dimethyl-4-hydroxytryptamine (psilocybin).</p>
  <p>Because the major pharmacological effects of ibogaine are probably not those 
    of a hallucinogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>127,159,168</sup></a> and because only a very few illicit samples have 
    been encountered, we will not discuss the subject further.</p> 

<h3>Ergot Alkaloids</h3>

  <p>Lysergic acid (<em>Compound 1, Figure 1</em>) is a tetracyclic compound, 
    and as noted previously, contains an indole nucleus and belongs to the family 
    of ergot alkaloids. Nearly all of the known naturally occurring hallucinogens 
    have a 3-(2-ethylamino)-indole contained within the molecular structure. The 
    assessment of a particular LSD derivative as a candidate for a future CsA 
    involves the consideration of several points. The most important are those 
    attempts made by other researchers to modify the structure of LSD while retaining 
    hallucinogenic activity. To date, all attempts to modify the tetracyclic ring 
    system have resulted in a loss of hallucinogenic activity. For instance, of 
    the four possible C-8 stereoisomers only the dextro isomer of LSD is hallucinogenic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>124</sup></a>. Modification of the amide alkyl 
    substituents also reduces hallucinogenic activity substantially<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>160</sup></a>. 
    Additionally, substitution with either a hydroxyl 
    or a methoxy at the C-12 of LSD results in a compound with no hallucinogenic 
    activity<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>160</sup></a>, whereas a comparably 
    substituted methoxyindolealkylamine appears to always be hallucinogenic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>42</sup></a>. The only structural modification which results 
    in the maintenance of hallucinogenic activity on par with LSD is the substitution 
    of either a methyl or an acetyl to the indole nitrogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>125</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The total synthesis of LSD derivatives is not simple and requires the talents 
    of an adept synthetic chemist<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>38,76,92</sup></a>. Much of the LSD produced today 
    uses ergotamine that is obtained from legitimate commercial sources (<em>Golden, 
    L. personal communication</em>). However, if ergotamine becomes difficult 
    to obtain from commercial sources, the ergot alkaloids can be produced easily 
    and in large quantities by cultivating strains of the fungus Claviceps in 
    submerged cultures<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>142</sup></a>. Given the fact 
    that structural modifications of the tetracyclic ring system are likely to 
    result in a product with either little or no activity, and the fact that there 
    will never be a shortage of ergot alkaloids for clandestine syntheses, it 
    is quite unlikely that the total synthesis of LSD or derivatives thereof will 
    become commonplace in the near term. One final point to consider is that the 
    CFR lists LSD and all optical, geometrical, and positional isomers of LSD 
    under Schedule I, and Iysergic acid and lysergic acid amide under Schedule III.</p>

  <p>Because of previously noted pharmacodynamics and the imposing nature of a 
    total synthesis, the immediate precursor of a LSD derivative synthesis will 
    most certainly be a controlled substance, namely lysergic acid; therefore, 
    much of the impetus forproducing noncontrolled LSD derivatives is lost. However, 
    if the CsA amendment were not a consideration there would be a clear first 
    choice via substitution of the indole nitrogen to create either 1-alkyl or 
    1-acyl derivatives. Derivatives of this type most probably fall under the 
    purview of the CsA amendment. The N,N-methylpropyl isomer Of LSD has been 
    the only derivative of LSD examined by the author. Derivatives of this type 
    might seem to be an unlikely choice for a CsA due to a high probability of 
    significant loss in hallucinogenic activity. However, a reduction in hallucinogenic 
    activity may become acceptable to the U. S. clandestine chemist when he notes 
    that lysergic acid amide is listed as a Schedule III substance in the CFR; 
    therefore, structurally similar substances of this compound are exempted from 
    the CsA amendment. A lucid argument can then be made that lysergic acid N,N-dimethylamide 
    is derived from lysergic acid amide rather than LSD. Carrying this theme to 
    the next logical step one would then assume that the 1-alkyl and 1-acyl derivatives 
    of the N,N-dimethyl isomer would also not be controlled by the CsA amendment. 
    At present, no known CsA of LSD has ever been encountered by the DEA.</p>

  <h3>Indolealkylamines</h3>

<p>All of the hallucinogenic indolealkylamines can be classified as belonging 
    to the family of compounds known as tryptamines and are substituted 3-(2-ethylamino)-indoles.</p> 

  <p>The tryptamines are a most interesting and biologically useful class of compounds. 
    In the human body, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) functions as a vasoconstrictor, 
    inhibits gastric secretion, stimulates smooth muscle, and is naturally present 
    in the central nervous system where it is involved in neurotransmission<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>44</sup></a>. The 5-methoxy homolog of serotonin is considered 
    to be hallucinogenic in humans as is the 5-methoxy homolog of gramine (3-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)-indole)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>41</sup></a>. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), 
    formed by the mammalian pineal gland, appears to depress gonadal function 
    and is known to cause contractions of melanophores. Bufotenine, the N,N-dimethyl 
    homolog of serotonin, is classified as a very weakly active hallucinogen and 
    is noted to have extremely unpleasant cardiovascular depressive side effects<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>63</sup></a>. The O-methyl homolog of 
    bufotenine, N,N-dimethyl- 5-methoxytryptamine (5-methoxy-DMT), is reported 
    to be an extremely potent hallucinogen, but it, like all other C-5 substituted 
    indolealkylamines, is not active if taken by mouth<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a>. 
    Both DMT and DET are well known for their hallucinogenic activity, just as 
    both of these compounds are also inactive if taken by mouth. The N,N-dipropyl 
    and diallyl derivatives are also hallucinogenic only if used either parenterally 
    or by inhalation at approximately the same level as DET, whereas higher homologs 
    abruptly become inactive<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>148</sup></a>. 
    The compound 6-hydroxy-DET has been determined to be a major metabolite of 
    DET in man<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>149</sup></a>, and it does not 
    possess hallucinogenic activity<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>150</sup></a>. Conversely, 
    the 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamines (psilocin and psilocybin), are very 
    active hallucinogens when taken orally. The activity of psilocybin <nobr>(O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-DMT)</nobr> 
    when taken by mouth is not related to the phosphoric acid radical since the 
    pharmacological effects of psilocin (4-hydroxy-DMT) are identical<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>67</sup></a>. Pharmacological information for baeocystin 
    <nobr>(4-hydroxy-N-methyltryptamine)</nobr> was not found; however, one would expect hallucinogenic 
    activity to parallel that of the N-alkyl-tryptamines and thereby would expect 
    the drug to be weakly hallucinogenic.</p>

  <p>It is thought that in the past most clandestine syntheses of indolealkylamines 
    used indole as the starting material<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>144</sup></a>. 
    A modest literature search will convince a clandestine chemist that the use 
    of the Fischer indole synthesis affords access to a greater variety of indole 
    derivatives<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>69,119</sup></a> as it will also reduce the 
    chance that law enforcement will be alerted by his purchases of essential 
    chemicals. Hence, in the production of indolealkylamine derivatives, the covert 
    chemist need not be limited by the commercial availability of appropriate 
    indole precursors.</p>
  <p>Relative to those which lack an aryl ring substitution, there is no doubt 
    that the activity of psilocybin/psilocin upon ingestion is due to an enhancement 
    of gastrointestinal absorption which, in turn, must be structurally related 
    to the presence of the C-4 hydroxyl substitution. Therefore, if the CsA amendment 
    were not a consideration, derivatives derived from psilocin would be the obvious 
    first choice. These derivatives are the 4-hydroxy-N,N-alkyl homologs starting 
    with N,N-dimethyl, N,N-methyl-ethyl, and on to N,N-diallyl to give a total 
    of 10 possible derivatives. As is also the case for hallucinogenic phenylalkylamines, 
    alkyl substitution, not to exceed a C-3 moiety, at the position alpha to the 
    side chain nitrogen generally will maintain hallucinogenic activity. This 
    brings the total possible number of hallucinogenic CsA's of psilocin to 40. 
    A somewhat removed second choice would be the same series of derivatives in 
    conjunction with either acetylation or methylation of the indole nitrogen. 
    This would then bring the total number of the possible 4-hydroxy-substituted 
    tryptamine CsA's (less one for psilocin) to 119.</p>
  <p>The 5-methoxy derivatives of gramine and serotonin are first choices for 
    future CsA's when considering the new U. S. amendment. Substitution at the 
    alpha carbon on the side chain will probably maintain psychotropic activity 
    only for serotonin derivatives. Hence, allowing only a methoxy substituent 
    at the aryl C-5 position, and a substitution at the carbon alpha to the nitrogen 
    (the nitrogen being any combination of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 
    and allyl) 75 CsA's can be obtained. Then substitution of the indole nitrogen 
    with either methyl or acetyl brings the total number of possible CsA's that 
    can be argumentatively related to serotonin to 225.</p>
  <p> An additional series of compounds that could serve as future CsA's under 
    U. S. law are those which are substituted with alkyl groups at the carbon 
    alpha to the side chain nitrogen. Recently, a commercially available tryptamine 
    which has an ethyl moiety substituted at the alpha carbon has become the newest 
    U.S. tryptamine CsA. Known as ET in the illicit CsA drug market is 3-(2-amino-butyl)indole 
    (Etryptamine, Monase&reg; by Upjohn; <em>compound 3, Figure 3</em>). Because 
    ET does not appear in either Schedule I or II of the CFR and is a legally 
    marketed product, ET and derivatives thereof are exempted from control under 
    the CsA amendment. Pharmacokenitic data on ET indicates that it is a monoamine 
    oxidase inhibitor<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>45,90</sup></a> and psycho-energizer<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>31,118</sup></a>. 
Hence, ET could produce 
    some degree of hallucinogenic activity in man. In 1986 ET was reported as 
    the she causative agent in a fatal overdose in Duesseldorf, Germany<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>30</sup></a>. This may be one of the few times that a CsA has originated outside 
    of the U. S. The sample of ET which was submitted to our laboratory appears 
    to have been obtained from the Aldrich Chemical Company (<em>$48.05/100g</em>). Unfortunately, it is not yet clear if ET is actually the substance which 
    is producing the biological response being sought by the illicit user. It 
    is the case that the sample of ET we examined and the batch of ET which the 
    Aldrich Chemical Company is presently selling contains a major quantity (about 
    30%) of the agent shown in Figure 4 which could also be a hallucinogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>107,158</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Nomenclature for this possible hallucinogen can either be 1-methyl-3-ethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroharmane, 
    or 2,2-dimethyl-4-ethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-&beta;-carboline. The creation 
    of this substance most probably occurred after synthesis and during the purification 
    of ET. Under anhydrous conditions, the reaction of acetone and ET would give 
    the corresponding enamine which could then undergo a Mannich condensation 
    to yield the hallucinogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>132,165</sup></a>. The compound 2-methyl-8-methoxy-4,5-dihydro-&beta;-carboline (harmaline) 
    is considered to be a hallucinogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>59</sup></a> as well as 
    a monoamine oxidase inhibitor<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a>. On the other hand, the 
    compound 2-methyl-8-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-&beta;-carboline is classified 
    as a tranquilizer<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>160</sup></a>. We were not able to attain any literature 
    whatsoever on the hallucinogen shown in (<em>Figure 3, Compound 4</em>), much less any 
    pharmacokenetic data. Hence, due to the apparently unpredictable pharmacological 
    behavior of structurally similar &beta;-carboline derivatives, I will not 
    speculate as to the pharmacological properties of said substance.</p>
  
  <h3>Phenylalkylamines</h3>

  <p>As was observed for the simple indole alkaloids, there are several simple phenylalkylamines 
  which play important roles in the normal biological function. Some of these 
  are tyrosine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), 3,4-dihydroxytryptamine (dopamine), 
  and norepinephrine. The naturally occurring hallucinogenic protoalkaloid, mescaline, 
  is 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine. Structural modifications which impart 
  hallucinogenic activity to phenylethylamines have been studied and a considerable 
  quantity of that data is easily retrieved. The following constitutes a brief 
  review of some of the most salient concepts relative to hallucinogenic activity 
  chemical structure relationships within the family of phenylethylamine derivatives.</p> 

  <p>It has been found that the addition of methoxy moieties to the aromatic ring 
    of a phenylethylamine, in general, produces compounds that are psychotomimetic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>135</sup></a>. Further, it has been noted that the methylenedioxy 
    moiety can be used in the place of two adjacent ring substituted methoxy groups 
    with C-3,4 substitution providing the most potent psychotogens<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>4,19,106,133</sup></a>.  Historically 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine 
    (MDA) has probably been the most consistently abused psychotomimetic phenylethylamine. 
    Amphetamine and methamphetamine are adrenomimetic at low to moderate dose 
    levels; however, at high dose levels they also become psychotomimetic in man<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>28,97</sup></a>. Additionally, it has been found 
    that the addition of an &alpha;-alkyl moiety (up to C-3)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>141</sup></a> to methoxyphenylethylamines results in an increase in hallucinogenic 
    activity and, alkyl only substitutions to the aromatic ring tend to result 
    in a gradual loss of central activity which can be related to the increasing 
    size or the alkyl group<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>52,102</sup></a>. 
    Braun et al.<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>20</sup></a> has determined that a gradual decrease in psychotomimetic 
    activity also occurs with the increasing size of a N-alkyl substituent. Braun 
    also noted that upon N,N-dialkyl substitution an abrupt and significant loss 
    of hallucinogenic activity occurs, whereas N-hydroxy substitution maintains 
    activity.</p>

  <p>The bases of structure-activity relationships as determined by aromatic ring 
    substitutions are not obvious. For instance, mescaline has relatively prominent 
    psychotomimetic properties but 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (3,4-dimethoxydopamine) 
    is not considered to be psychotogenic, and the hallucinogenic potency of 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine 
    is less than that of mescaline<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>61</sup></a>. On the other 
    hand, the hallucinogenic potency of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine is approximately 
    three times that of mescaline<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>20</sup></a>. Also, tyramine <nobr>(4-hydroxyphenylethylamine)</nobr> 
    is devoid of hallucinogenic activity, but 4-methoxy-tyramine is weakly hallucinogenic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>140</sup></a>. However, 2-methoxymethamphetamine has no known hallucinogenic 
    activity<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>160</sup></a>, and the <nobr>4-methoxyphenyl-&alpha;-methyl-ethylamine</nobr> 
    (4-methoxyamphetamine) has five limes the psychotropic activity of mescaline<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>136</sup></a>. To complicate the situation further, one work reported the 
    synthesis of 4-substituted methamphetamine derivatives using both ring activating 
    and ring deactivating substituents of quite different atomic volumes, and 
    found hallucinogenic activity present for all derivatives. The compounds in 
    question are 4-bromo-, 4-amino-, 4-chloro-, 4-nitro-, 4-iodo-, and 4-hydroxymethamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>91</sup></a>. It is a little surprising that substituents of such radically 
    different atomic volumes and electronegativities would all give 4-substituted 
    phenylisopropylamine derivatives having psychotropic activity. In contrast, 
    another study of hallucinogenic activity as a function of aromatic ring substitution, 
    found the compound <nobr>2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine</nobr> to be some eighty times 
    more potent than mescaline but upon going to the 4-ethyl derivative, quite 
    a trivial change, nearly all hallucinogenic activity was supposedly lost<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>134</sup></a>. Despite these seeming inconsistencies, many of the necessary structural 
    requirements for producing hallucinogenic phenylethylamine can be understood 
    bynoting the common structural features of these psychotogens. The structure 
    activity relationships noted above can be found in a single source review 
    article by Shulgin<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>136</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The following phenylalkylamines are listed under Schedule I of the CFR as hallucinogens:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><span class="oli">4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxyamphetamine (DOB) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2,5-Dimethoxyamphetamine (2,5-DMA) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">4-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">5-Methoxy-3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">4-Methyl-2,5-Dimethoxyamphetamine (DOM, STP) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">3,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA) </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenethylamine (Mescaline) </span></li>
    </ol>


    
  <p>The majority of the hallucinogenic phenylethylamines which are presently controlled 
    under U. S. law were first encountered in a relatively short period of time 
    in the latter part of 1960. Since that time the emergence of new CsA's Of 
    psychotogenic phenylethylamines has continued but at a much reduced pace. 
    Starting in 1972, several samples of MDMA were analyzed by DEA laboratories. 
    Apparently MDMA was readily accepted by the user and abuse has continued to 
    increase. Presently in the U. S. and Canada there are at least four other 
    CsA's of psychotogenic phenylethylamines in the illicit market. These are 
    N-hydroxy-3,4-methylenedioxy- amphetamine (N-hydroxy MDA), N-ethyl MDA (EVE, 
    MDEA), 4-ethoxy-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (MEM)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, and 
    4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (DBMPEA) (<em>Sapienza, E personal communication; 
    Allen, A. personal communication</em>). Upon placing MDMA under legal controls, 
    the N-ethyl homolog of MDA (EVE) was immediately introduced as a replacement 
    for MDMA. However, it seems that EVE has not been well accepted by the user, 
    apparently because EVE has a lower potency than MDMA; therefore requiring 
    a larger dose to produce psychotropic effects and often resulting in making 
    the user ill<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>83</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Assuming the ready availability of the appropriate chemical precursors, and 
    assuming a lack of concern for the legal provisions enacted by governments 
    for the purpose of controlling CsA's, choices for CsA's of ring substituted 
    phenylethylamine psychotogens are numerous. Previously cited literature provides 
    many such CsA possibilities with at least ten aromatic ring substituted amphetamines 
    (<em>Compounds numbered 5-15, Figure 4</em>) having potencies greater than mescaline 
    (<em>Compound 5</em>). Other CsA's can be obtained from compounds 6 through 15 by modification 
    of the &alpha;-alkyl side chain to either C-2 or C-3 alkyls, and mono-substitution 
    or the nitrogen with either hydroxy or short chain alkyl. These modifications 
    result in a total Of 160 possible CsA's based only upon the ring substitutions 
    of the aforementioned compounds. Additionally, tile ring substituted phenylisopropylamines 
    which are presently controlled substances, can be modified in the same manner, 
    and after excluding controlled substances and N-hydroxy MDA, there are 118 
    more possible derivatives, giving a total of 278 possible new CsA's. Each 
    time a new ring substitution is introduced, such as MEM, then this number 
    is increased by 16.</p>

  <p>If the U. S. CsA amendment is a consideration, then psychotomimetic phenylethylamines 
    could be created from compounds which are structurally related to dopamine, 
    adrenaline <nobr>(N-methyl-3,4-di-hydroxyphenyl-&beta;- hydroxyethylamine)</nobr>, and 
    norepinephrine <nobr>(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-&beta;-hydroxyethylamine)</nobr>. A case in point 
    is the compound macromerine, N,N-dimethyl-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl-&beta;-hydroxyethylamine, 
    a known psychotogen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>60</sup></a>. Some other compounds which could 
    be used as CsA models are synephrine <nobr>(N-methyl-4,&beta;-dihydroxyphenylethylamine)</nobr>, 
    phentermine <nobr>(&alpha;,-&alpha;-dimethylphenylethylamine)</nobr>, 4-chlorophentermine, 
    mephentermine <nobr>(N,&alpha;,&alpha;-trimethylphenylethylamine)</nobr>, phenelzine (phenylethylhydrazine), 
    and tranylcypromine <nobr>(2-phenylcyclopropylamine)</nobr>. Structural modifications of 
    these compounds could provide quite a few additional CsA's. Because of the 
    sheer size of the task, no attempt was made to determine the total number 
    of possible CsA's that could be derived by using these compounds as models. 
    However, the magnitude of the possibilities become evident when one calculates 
    tile possible CsA's which, could be obtained using just dopamine (<em>Compound 
    16, Figure 5</em>) as the model compound, as is demonstrated in the following paragraph.</p>

  <p>The total number of possible CsA's were limited by the following considerations:</p>
 
<ol>
	<li><span class="oli">Ring substitution at <em>C-3,4</em> is dimethoxy</span></li> 
	<li><span class="oli">Ring substitution to sites <em>C-2,5,6</em> were limited to combinations of CH<sub>3</sub>-, Br-, Cl-, and CH<sub>3</sub>O-,</span></li> 
	<li><span class="oli">Substitution on the amine nitrogen and the alpha carbon were limited to the following: 
      <ol>	
		<li><span class="oli">Of the three ring sites available for substitution, no more than two were allowed for any given structure</span></li> 
		<li><span class="oli">Single substitution on the ring at <em>C-2</em> to give 2,3,4-trisubstituted derivatives was disallowed</span></li> 
		<li><span class="oli">Mixed halide structures were excluded</span></li> 
		<li><span class="oli">Ring substitutions which would result in any derivative which is presently a controlled substance were disallowed.</span></li>
	</ol></span></li>
</ol>

  <p>Given these considerations there are 47 structures which can be drawn. Each 
    one of these can then exist as 16 derivatives obtained by substitution as 
    shown above at the alpha carbon and nitrogen. The multiplication product of 
    these two values provides the total number of possible hallucinogenic CsA's 
    (752) which, one could argue, are structurally related to dopamine.</p>

  <p>Research targeted at the determination of structure-psychotropic activity 
    relationships has waned in recent years. Perhaps in future years it will be 
    the clandestine chemist who will fill in the blanks.</p>
   
  <h3>Phencyclidine</h3>

  <p>The synthesis of phencyclidine (PCP) was first reported in 1958<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>26</sup></a> 
  and patent rights were granted to Parke, Davis & Co. in 1960 and 1963 for medical 
  use as an anesthetic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>110,111</sup></a>. PCP first came to the 
  attention of DEA, then the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, as a drug 
  of abuse inthe latter part of the 1960's. Pharmacologically, PCP has been described 
  as a pseudo hallucinogen which has many of the characteristics of a depressant 
  drug<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>104</sup></a>. Without question, PCP deserves a special niche in any 
  discussion of drugs of abuse if for no other reason than the notoriously bizarre 
  effects it has been known to have upon some of the abusing population<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>113</sup></a>.</p> 

  <p>The now so very familiar synthesis using 1-(1-piperidyl)cyclo-hexyl carbonitrile 
    and phenyl Grignard reagent was published by Maddox et al. in 1965 and, either 
    fortunately or unfortunately depending upon one's point of view, the accompanying 
    pharmacological data was useless as it could not be correlated to the compounds 
    synthesized<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>99</sup></a>. However, pertinent literature is not hard 
    to find as both the original U. S. patent<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>43</sup></a> and later 
    studies have provided a pharmacological basis for the production of CsA's 
    of PCP<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>87,88</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It does not appear to be possible for one to generate a CsA model structure 
    that will not fail under the CsA amendment provision which stipulates that 
    the term "controlled substance analogue" means a substance-the chemical structure 
    of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of, in this case, 
    PCP. This is the result of the fact that a one carbon separation between an 
    aryl system and the amine nitrogen, and the fact that the central carbon between 
    these moieties is in a ring system appear to be principal requirements for 
    PCP-like pharmacological activity. Other activity structure relationships 
    are: </p>

    <ol>
    <li><span class="oli">Substituents which decrease lipophilic character generally decrease potency</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Aryl substitution with 2-thienyl generally increases potency</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Substitutions onto the aryl system decreases potency</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">To maintain potency N,N-dialkyl substitutions should be either piperidino or pyrrolidino ring systems</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">N-ethyl is the most potent N-alkyl monosubstitution and potency falls off  rapidly with either an increase or decrease in the alkyl chain size</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Substitution on the beta carbon of either the cycloalkyl or the cycloalkylamino rings will most likely be synthetically difficult due to steric considerations.</span></li>
	</ol>

  <p>Because of factors noted above, there appears to be a relatively small probability 
    of a PCP CsA appearing in the illicit marketplace that will not fall under 
    the purview of the U. S. CsA amendment. However, it is also the case that 
    under U. S. law there is a reporting requirement placed upon the purveyors 
    of piperidine. Since the implementation of the piperidine reporting requirement 
    it has become much more difficult for the clandestine chemist to safely acquire 
    this chemical precursor of PCP. Therefore, a market force has been introduced 
    that will almost certainly result in the production of PCP CsA's which will 
    not contain a simple piperidino moiety. This thought, taken with the previously 
    discussed activity-structure relationships, allows one to suggest the 50 structures 
    depicted in Figure 6 as being representative of future CsA's of PCP. Of these 
    50 compounds, two have already been placedin the CFR Schedule I: N,N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-ethylamine 
    and N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-pyrrolidine.</p>

  <h3>Stimulants</h3>

  <p>Relative to medical usage, a stimulant is defined to be an agent that arouses 
  organic activity, strengthens the action of the heart, increases vitality, and 
  promotes a sense of well being. However, as per the medical definition, the 
  effects produced by a stimulant may not be a very accurate term for the effects 
  sought by those who abuse these compounds. For instance, at dose levels usually 
  equated with heavy abuse, both amphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>5,50</sup></a> and methamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>97</sup></a> are thought to be psychotogenic. 
  Therefore, several of the amphetamines could be discussed as hallucinogens; 
  however, it seems most likely that a substantial portion of the abuse of stimulant 
  drugs is performed with the intention of inducing a state of euphoria<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a>. Historically, the abuse of stimulants (euphoriants) has been largely 
  confined to amphetamine, derivatives thereof, and cocaine. Some of the amphetamine 
  derivatives which have been controlled under U. S. law are methamphetamine, 
  N-ethylamphetamine, fenethylline, phenmetrazine (preludin), phendimetrazine, 
  benzphetamine, chlorphentermine, clortermine, diethylpropion, methylphenidate, 
  pemoline, and amphetamine. Other derivatives of amphetamine which have been 
  encountered in samples submitted to DEA laboratories, but have not yet been 
  brought under legal controls, are bis-methamphetamine, fencamfamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>108</sup></a>, <nobr>N,N-dimethylamphetamine</nobr> (dimephenopan) (<em>A. Allen, personal communication</em>), 
  and an analog of pemoline, <nobr>4-methylaminorex</nobr> (U4Euh)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>72</sup></a>. 
  Since Pemoline is listed under Schedule IV of the CFR and <nobr>4-methylaminorex</nobr> is 
  clearly an analog Of pemoline, it falls outside of the guide-lines set forth 
  in the CsA amendment; therefore, <nobr>4-methylaminorex</nobr> is not controlled under U. 
  S. law. It is equally clear that <em>bis</em>-methamphetamine and <nobr>N,N-dimethylamphetamine</nobr> 
  do fall under the CsA guidelines and would be considered controlled substances 
  under tile CsA amendment. However, it may be that <nobr>N,N-dimethylamphetamine</nobr> may 
  not enjoy a long history in the clandestine market as at least one work states 
  that it is considerably less potent than methamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>126</sup></a>.</p> 

  <p>Most of the adrenomimetic activity-structure relationships were delineated 
    in the previous discussion on psychotomimetic phenylethylamines. The principle 
    difference between the pharmacological action, as related to structure for 
    these two classes of compounds, is determined by the nature of the substituents 
    on the aryl system. In general it is noted that substituents on the aryl system 
    which are ortho-para directors tend to produce psychotogenic compounds with 
    methoxy substituents often producing the most pharmacologically active hallucinogens. 
    However, there are several exceptions to this general statement, not the least 
    of which is exemplified by substitution on the phenyl ring of the electrophilic 
    hydroxy moiety which in nearly every case either eliminates or greatly reduces 
    hallucinogenic activity. On the other hand, adrenomimetic activity is clearly 
    enhanced by branching of phenylethylamine at the carbon alpha to the amine 
    nitrogen and is maintained at reasonable levels by substitution to the nitrogen 
    as shown in table II. Both N-ethylamphetamine and N,N-dimethylamphetamine 
    have appeared in the illicit market and clearly follow the points made above. 
    However, a market factor has been introduced by the fact that phenyl-2-propanone 
    (P2P) has been listed under the CFR as a Schedule II substance. Hence, it 
    makes little sense for the clandestine chemist to produce CsA's of phenylethylamines 
    which have potencies that are less than methamphetamine if he is going to 
    produce his CsA's in a synthesis that uses P2P. The recent illicit use of 
    4-methylaminorex may well be the result of the clandestine chemist trying 
    to circumvent the legal problems associated with P2P. On the other hand, the 
    sum total of methamphetamine still being covertly produced suggests that the 
    control of P2P has not appreciably reduced the drug's availability in the 
    illicit marketplace.</p>

  <p>As before, if the chemist is not concerned about the CsA amendment, the structural 
    possibilities offered by Table II, less the three controlled substances that 
    are included, provides for thirteen possible future stimulant CsA's. It would 
    seem that the single most logical next stimulant CsA would be N-methyl-&alpha;-ethyl-phenyl- 
    ethylamine. This compound should be pharmacologically very similar to methamphetamine 
    and synthesis could employ <nobr>1-phenyl-2-butanone</nobr> instead of P2P. Alternatively, 
    the use of <nobr>1-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-one</nobr>, in place of P2P, would almost certainly 
    give a product with adrenomimetic properties, and may in fact be considerably 
    more potent than methamphetamine.</p>

  <p>The clandestine chemist of limited chemical sophistication may not notice 
    the structural similarity of such compounds as methylphenidate, phenmetrazine, 
    4-methylaminorex, and amphetamine. If he does recognize the constancy of the 
    phenylisopropylamine substructure in these compounds he may well explore the 
    literature in an effort to determine the structural outer limits for the phenylisopropylamine 
    stimulants. At what may be near these structural outer limits he will find 
    a class of compounds which are correctly referred to as conformationally rigid 
    phenylethylamines. Some of the conformationally rigid phenylethylamines are 
    fencamfamine, tranylcypromine (2-phenylcyclopropylamine), 2-phenyl-cyclohexylamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>138</sup></a>, <nobr>2-amino-3-phenyl-<em>trans</em>-decalin</nobr>, and 2-aminotetralin<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. The potency of most of these compounds is highly 
    dependent upon stereochemistry. Those isomeric forms which most closely approximate 
    the anti periplanar conformation observed for amphetamine in solution are 
    the most potent stimulants. Hence, <em>trans</em>-tranylcypromine is considerably more 
    potent than is the <em>cis</em> isomer<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>48</sup></a>. The most active isomer 
    of these compounds does not approach the potency of the simple phenylisopropylamines. 
    Given this reduction in potency for the most active isomers one would think 
    that, in order to obtain amiable product for the illicit market, a stereo 
    specific synthesis would be required. This feature, along with a lowered potency 
    for even the more active isomers, may very well exclude the conformationally 
    rigid phenylethylamines from the synthetic repertoire of the surreptitious 
    chemist. Hence, it is a reasonable expectation that those conformationally 
    rigid phenylethylamines which will be abused in the future will be obtained 
    by diversion of limit supplies rather than by clandestine syntheses.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it seems to be an axiom that any compound which has any possibility 
    of altering man's perception of himself or his surroundings will at some time 
    be abused. Propylhexadrine, although not an extreme example, is nevertheless 
    an example of a compound which has been abused although adrenogenic potency 
    is far less than that of methamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>39</sup></a>. Therefore, one must 
    expect some abuse of the conformationally rigid phenylethylamines to occur. 
    It would be my guess however, that the extent of such abuse will never be 
    large.</p>

  <p>The parent structure for 4-methylaminorex has been known since 1889<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>37</sup></a> and many derivatives thereof have been studied for pharmacological activity. 
    Pemoline (2-amino-5-phenyl-2-oxazolin-4-one)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>68,154</sup></a>  is presently a controlled substance in the U. S., is classified 
    as a stimulant, and is listed under Schedule IV of the CFR. Poos (<em>personal 
    communication</em>) synthesized and performend pharmacological studies for some 
    twenty seven <nobr>2-amino-2-oxazoline</nobr> isomers of which aminorex and 4-methylaminorex 
    were two. In this work, aminorex and <nobr>4-methylaminorex</nobr>, regardless of the steroisomer 
    employed, were found to have anorectic activity on par with <nobr>d-amphetamine</nobr>. 
    However, adrenomimetic activity of 4-methylaminorex was determined to be less 
    than that of amphetamine and similar to phenmetrazine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>112</sup></a>. It has been suggested that the effectiveness of stimulant drugs as 
    appetite suppressants are the result of the fact that the user forgets to 
    eat and that this behavior is in direct proportion to the adrenomimetic activity 
    of the drug<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>29</sup></a>. Contrary to previously cited work this suggests 
    that aminorex may in fact be as potent an adrenomimetic as amphetamine. In 
    any case, Poos (<em>personal communication</em>) highlighted eight compounds which 
    may have adrenomimetic activity similar to those of amphetamine and methamphetamine.</p>

  <p>Shown below and listed in decreasing order of anoretic activity they are:</p> 
    
    <ol>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxazoline</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-oxazoline</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-oxazoline</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-oxazoline</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-phenyl)-2-oxazoline <strong>[</strong><em>Aminorex</em><strong>]</strong></span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-5-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-oxazoline</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Dimethylamino-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline </span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">2-Amino-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline <strong>[</strong><em>4-Methylaminorex</em><strong>]</strong>.</span></li>
</ol>


  <p>Although not mentioned in this work, one would immediately assume that the 
    4-fluorophenyl- and 4-chlorophenyl derivatives of compounds 7 and 8 would also 
    have significant anoretic activity. Given the astoundingly simple synthetic 
    process required to produce these compounds, and the fact that the 4-halogen 
    substituted aryl derivatives would require precursors unlikely to titillate 
    the interest of law enforcement agencies, these compounds will most probably 
    be made in future clandestine syntheses. It is also conceivable that some 
    enterprising clandestine chemist will wonder if appropriately substituted 
    methoxy derivatives will have psychotomimetic properties.</p>

  <p> The literature contain many references to stimulant drugs of variant structures 
    which may not spark the interest of the less knowledgeable clandestine chemist. 
    However, nearly all of these compounds can be accessed through literature 
    searches for either derivatives of phenylethlamines or stimulant compounds. 
    Several compounds which serve as examples are fenmetramid<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>73</sup></a>, prolintane, 
    <nobr>1-(&alpha;-propyl-phenylethyl) pyrrolidine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>55,62</sup></a></nobr>, pyrovalerone <nobr>(1-(4-methyl-phenyl)-1-oxo-2-pyrrolidino-n-pentane)</nobr><a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>56</sup></a>, <nobr>N,3,3-trimethyl-1-(m-tolyl)-1-phthalanpropylamine</nobr><a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>40</sup></a>, zylofuramine <nobr>(&alpha;-benzyl-n-ethyl- tetrahydro-D-threo-furfurylamine)</nobr><a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>51</sup></a>, a series of N-substituted phentermine compounds<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>, 4-hydroxyamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>65,66,100</sup></a>, N-methylephedrine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>139</sup></a>, nylidrin, <nobr>N-(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl-1-methyl-ethylamine</nobr><a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>155</sup></a>, pheniprazine, <nobr>&alpha;-methyl-phenylethyl-hydrazine</nobr><a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>169</sup></a>, and <nobr>N,N-diethyl-2-phenylcyclopropylamine</nobr> 
    (SKF). All of these compounds are derivatives of phenylethylamine with the 
    exception of <nobr>N,3,3-trimethyl-1-(m-tolyl)-1-phthalanpropylamine</nobr> which is a 
    3-phenyl-3-propylamine substituted onto a phthalane at C-1. A number of closely 
    allied derivatives of this compound have been examined and are classified 
    as weak stimulants.</p>

  <p>Fenmetramide is noteworthy in that it is a 2-one derivative of phenmetrazine. 
    Any and all of these compounds are subject to abuse; however, the synthesis 
    of simple phenylethylamine derivatives would not appear to offer the clandestine 
    chemist any advantage over the synthesis of methamphetamine. The reasons for 
    this statement are that pharmacological studies have not identified other 
    phenylethylamine structures with stimulant activity appreciably greater than 
    methamphetamine and that either P2P or the <nobr>&beta;-hydroxy-phenylisopropylamines</nobr> 
    are the preferred precursors. However, in any case, the U. S. CsA amendment 
    should apply for all compounds containing the phenylethylamine substructure.</p>
  <p>The stimulant drugs phenmetrazine (Preludin) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) 
    are controlled under Schedule II of the CFR. These compounds rank approximately 
    half-way between caffeine and amphetamine in potency<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>47,105,156</sup></a>. The published 
    synthesis of phenmetrazine, which would seem to be most amenable to the clandestine 
    laboratory, is given in the work by Otto<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>109</sup></a>. 
    The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed cyclization of N-hydroxyethylnorephedrine 
    (N-hydroxyethyl-phenylpropanolamine). However, this reaction places severe 
    limits on the production of CsA's because suitable precursors are limited. 
    For instance, phenmetrazine CsA could be prepared from compounds such as N-ethyl-2,2-hydroxyphenyl-1-methylethylamine, 
    1,1-hydroxyphenyl-2-aminobutane, etc, but limited commercial availability 
    would generally require synthesis of these compounds. Additionally, the product 
    CsA would clearly be perceived, even by the untrained, as being structurally 
    similar to phenmetrazine and thereby would be a controlled substance under 
    the CsA amendment. Further, the corresponding phenylethylamine which could 
    be made from these precursors, although also under the purview of the CsA 
    amendment, would most probably have greater adrenergic activity than the phenmetrazine 
    derivative. Hence, clandestine production of phenmetrazine CsA's would most 
    likely be an uncommon event.</p>

  <p>Pipradrol (<em>compound 38, Figure 12</em>) is a controlled substance under 
    CFR Schedule IV and can be considered to be an analog derivative of methylphenidate. 
    Methylphenidate can be synthesized by the method of Hartmann and Panizzon<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>53</sup></a>. The product exists as two diastereoisomeric 
    enantiomer pairs, one of which is the active stimulant, <em>threo</em>-<em>dl</em>-methylphenidate<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>163</sup></a>, while the other is inactive 
    as a stimulant. <em>Threo</em>-methylphenidate accounts for only 20% of the final reaction 
    product<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>121,122</sup></a>. The synthesis of pipradrol 
    may be more amenable to the clandestine laboratory as it is a relatively simple 
    synthesis and isolation of the final product is straightforward. An appropriate 
    C-2 substituted, N-protected piperidine is a suitable precursor for what is 
    essentially a two step synthesis<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>153,164</sup></a>. Numerous derivatives of methylphenidate and 
    pipradrol have been synthesized with the result that structure activity relationships 
    have been well defined.<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>10,33,54,93,103,116,128,131,152,166,167</sup></a>  There is 
    little incentive, beyond the not inconsiderable pressure of an already existing 
    and ready market, for producing clandestine CsA's of methylphenidate. However, 
    there are a number of pipradrol derivatives described in the last cited references 
    which are suitable for clandestine production. A best bet for a future CsA 
    is the most potent adrenomimetic compound in this series, 2-diphenyl-methylpiperidine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>157</sup></a>, which is estimated to be 
    as potent as methamphetamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>146</sup></a>. 
    In a very similar article to this paper, "Drugs of Abuse in the Future," Shulgin<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>137</sup></a> 
    suggested that levophacetoperane 
    (<em>compound 40, Figure 12</em>) could well be a future clandestine CsA. 
    However, this compound shares the same limitations for clandestine synthesis 
    as does methylphenidate, in that only one diastereoisomer is active<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>75</sup></a> and it is less potent than methylphenidate<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>Although the phenylisopropylamine substructure is an integral part of most 
    known stimulants, the well known and much abused stimulant, cocaine, does 
    not share this structural feature. The cocaine molecule instead compares more 
    closely to the structure of acetylcholine. The synthesis of cocaine has recently 
    been revisited by Casale and many of the procedural techniques are explained 
    in sufficient detail so that any competent organic chemist can now make the 
    C-3 equatorial cocaines<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>25</sup></a>; however, 
    it is still a tedious and demanding synthesis, and in my opinion will only 
    be encountered on rare occasions in clandestine laboratories. The particular 
    pharmacological behavior of cocaine is unquestionably due in major part to 
    the stereochemistry of the molecule as determined by the fused bicyclic tropane 
    ring system<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>27</sup></a>. Given the present 
    difficulties associated with the synthesis of the tropanes and the ready availability 
    of the natural product, it is unlikely that a synthetic CsA of this compound 
    will appear in the near future. However, it is the case that certain modifications 
    of natural cocaine can result in products having substantially greater potencies 
    than cocaine. The compounds <nobr>2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane</nobr> and <nobr>2-carbomethoxy-3-phenyl-nortropane</nobr> are both some 60 times more potent than cocaine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>27</sup></a>. These compounds could well be of interest to some 
    clandestine chemists as taking one kilogram or cocaine and converting it into 
    a product some sixty times more potent would obviously be quite cost effective.</p>
  <p>In "Drugs of Abuse in the Future," Shulgin<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>137</sup></a> 
    directed attention to another stimulant which also does not contain the phenylethylamine 
    substructure and, in fact, is reminiscent of the depressant glutethimide. 
    The compound is known commercially as Bemegride, 4-ethyl-4-methylpiperidine-2,6-dione, 
    and was first synthesized by Thole and Thorpe in 1911<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>151</sup></a>. The principal medical use is as an analeptic in 
    barbiturate poisoning. As a stimulant, bemegride is approximately equal to 
    phendimetrazine and pemoline in potency. Although glutethimide and bemegride 
    are structurally similar, their pharmacokinetics are diametrically opposed. 
    Hence, bemegride cannot be described as a CsA. Bemegride, by virtue of being 
    a stimulant, has an obvious potential for abuse, although under the conditions 
    of abuse, rather large quantities of the drug will be required. Increasing 
    the possibility of bemegride abuse are the facts that the synthesis of the 
    compound is not difficult and, of course, does not use either a controlled 
    or watched substance as a precursor<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <h3>Sedatives-Depressants</h3>

  <p>Depressants include such diverse chemical entities as methaqualone, 5,5-disubstituted 
    barbituric acids, glutethimide and methyprylon, benzodiazepines, chlorhexadol, 
    chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, meprobamate, and ethyl alcohol to name a few. 
    Historically in the U. S., the abuse of depressants, alcohol aside, has been 
    in major part confined to the barbiturates, methaqualone, and the benzodiazepines. 
    Barbiturate abuse peaked in the mid 1970's and has since become near nonexistent, 
    in part no doubt, to the well deserved bad press that the barbiturates garnered. 
    The abuse of methaqualone peaked around 1980 and has also declined steadily 
    since that time. However, much counterfeit "lude" is still being sold, but 
    instead of containing methaqualone, the tablets now often contain diazepam. 
    Diazepam has become the most prevalent depressant drug of abuse and its use 
    is apparently continuing to rise. It is somewhat peculiar that of the many 
    benzodiazepines known and readily available in the legal commercial market, 
    diazepam is by far the most extensively abused. The factors controlling this 
    apparent user preference for diazepam is certainly related, in part, to simple 
    product recognition; however, it is my perception that the dominant factor 
    is the ease with which the drug can be diverted from the legitimate market. 
    In 1985 the legitimate diazepam market consisted of 5 billion tablets<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>34</sup></a> (<em>Franzosa 
    1985</em>) and since that time generic diazepam tablet production 
    has increased along with even greater product availability for diversion into 
    the illicit market (<em>Franzosa, E. personal communication</em>).</p> 

  <p>A typical benzodiazepine synthesis is not be considered difficult and a methaqualone 
    synthesis is quite straightforward<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>46</sup></a> (Grimmel et al. 1946). Further, there is 
    a great abundance of literature from which the clandestine chemist can draw 
    in deciding upon a CsA based upon either the benzodiazepines or methaqualone 
    itself. However, with the very notable exception of methaqualone, the clandestine 
    syntheses of depressant drugs in the U. S. have been extremely rare (Franzosa, 
    E. personal communication). It is not likely that a clandestinely synthesized 
    benzodiazepine CsA will be encountered as long as the huge, easily diverted 
    legitimate supplies are at hand.</p>

  <p>The use of methaqualone is in decline, but it will be with us as an abused 
    substance for still some time. Given the very large numbers associated with 
    the clandestine synthesis of methaqualone, it is perhaps surprising that only 
    two CsA's of methaqualone, have been analyzed at this laboratory. Again, past 
    history would suggest a high probability for the appearance of new CsA of 
    methaqualone in the future. A CsA of methaqualone will by necessity have the 
    3-aryl-quinazoline structure, and as a result will fall under the CsA amendment. 
    One would shell predict that the driving force behind any future clandestine 
    synthesis of a methaqualone CsA will revolve around attempts to use precursor 
    materials which will not alert law enforcement lo the existence of the clandestine 
    laboratory. A literature review for CsA candidates will quickly surface several 
    possibilities<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>16,17,24,70,74,84,85,115,145</sup></a>. 
    One of the most intriguing methaqualone CsA's from the perspective of a clandestine 
    chemist would have to be the halo- and thio- derivatives described by Joshi 
    et al.<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>86</sup></a>. Two of the compounds from this 
    work possess depressant activity greater than methaqualone and would be particularly 
    well suited to clandestine synthesis.</p>

  <h3>Analgesics</h3>

  <p>Literature covering the analgesics is so voluminous that a review of the 
    published data on the subject is far beyond the scope of this work. Most of 
    the potent analgesics are modeled after features found within the structure 
    of morphine and some literature detailing these structural features has been 
    published by Paul Janssen<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>77,78,79,80,81</sup></a>. 
    Despite a significant passage of time, the structure activity relationships 
    established in these works still comprise a very sizable portion of our empirical 
    knowledge on this subject.</p>
  <p>Some 13 years ago, Shulgin<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>137</sup></a> provided a short 
    overview of many of the known major classes of analgesics. The following constitutes 
    a similar listing:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><span class="oli">Morphines</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Morphinans and isomorphinans</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Benzomorphans</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Pethidines (meperidines), prodines, and ketobemidones</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Fentanyls</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">3,3-Diphenylpropylamines (methadone, propoxyphene)</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Thiambutenes</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Phenampromide and 1-dialkylaminoethyl-2-(4-alkyloxy)benzyl-5-nitrobenzimidazols</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Pirinitramide derivatives</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Numerous works have dealt with the syntheses and pharmacological testing 
    of derivatives of the structures listed above. Synthetic procedures have been 
    improved and refinements aimed at the tailoring of specific analgesics to 
    fulfill certain medical needs have been addressed. However, it has been since 
    1975 that no work has been found introducing a new class of analgesics of 
    either unusual potency or particularly well suited to synthesis in clandestine 
    laboratories. There has been discovered one compound which may be of minor 
    interest in that it is an analgesic with potency similar to morphine and can 
    be described as a ring condensation product of N,N',3-trimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a>. In any discussion of synthetic analgesics 
    one must include the so called Bentley compounds. These compounds are not, 
    in the purest sense, synthetic analgesics as they are C-ring etheno Diels 
    Alder adducts of thebaine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a>. 
    Etorphine (<em>compound 47, Figure 14</em>) is perhaps the best known compound 
    in the series and has analgesic activity approximately 1000 times that of 
    morphine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>13,71</sup></a>. 
    Although reaction conditions appear to be critical, the synthesis of etorphine 
    derivatives involves what is essentially a two step reaction with methylvinylketone 
    and an appropriate organometallic reagent<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>49,64</sup></a>. Hence, the only expected difficulty 
    in the clandestine synthesis of these compounds would lie in the initial acquisition 
    of the thebaine. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that either etorphine 
    or derivatives thereof have not become a contributor to illicit analgesic 
    supplies. On the other hand, if etorphine were to be admixed with some less 
    potent analgesic, such as heroin, it is doubtful that it would ever be detected. 
    In his 1975 article, Shulgin pointed to meperidine, prodine, and ketobemidone 
    as possible models for "Drugs of Abuse in the Future." There are some who 
    think that Shulgin's comments were somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy 
    as it is felt that his article is well worn within the circles of clandestine 
    laboratory operators (<em>Sapienza, F. personal communication</em>). 
    Supporting this premise, at least to some extent, is the fact that the appearance 
    of the first known fentanyl, China While, did not occur until 1979 (<em>Henderson, 
    G. I.. personal communication</em>). However, it is also the case 
    that desmethylprodine (MPPP) was first encountered in a DEA laboratory sample 
    submission in July of 1973 (<em>Kram, T. personal communication</em>), 
    a full two years before Shulgin published his article.</p>
  <p>The probability that CsA's of prodine will constitute any appreciable quantity 
    of the clandestine analgesic market in the future is relatively remote. The 
    well publicized neuro-toxicity of the prodine dehydration product, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 
    (MPTP)<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>36,94,101,114</sup></a>, coupled with a limited scope of derivatives 
    having appreciable analgesic activity<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>9,14,98,170</sup></a> would 
    seem to remove prodine from consideration as a model for CsA's. The fact that 
    the 3-allyl analog of MPTP is not thought to be neurotoxic<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a> and the corresponding prodine analog has greater analgesic 
    activity than does &beta;-prodine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>171</sup></a> 
    may be of some interest to the clandestine laboratory operator. However, allylprodine 
    (<em>compound 49, Figure 15</em>) is already controlled under Schedule 1. 
    A prodine derivative which may be found in a future clandestine laboratory 
    is &alpha;-promedol<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>35</sup></a>. 
    Analgesic activity for the unresolved stereoisomers of promedol is approximately 
    ten times that of morphine, but there is some increased difficulty associated 
    with the synthesis and neurotoxicity for it's MPTP analog is a real possibility. 
    It is also the case that &alpha;-promedol is listed in CFR Schedule I under 
    the name of trimeperidine.</p>
  <p>In any event, the syntheses of prodine CsA's arc fraught with considerable 
    risk from the inadvertent production of either MPTP or an as yet unexplored 
    congener also having neurotoxic properties. It is worth noting that at one 
    time MPTP was tested for use as an insecticide and that there are reports 
    of workers handling MPTP who have suffered full blown Parkinsonian symptoms 
    (<em>Shafer, J. personal communication</em>).</p>
  <p>Meperidine (pethidine, demerol) is approximately 50% as potent an analgesic 
    as is morphine and has a safety margin of only 4.8 as compared to 71 for morphine<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>82</sup></a> Hence, one would assume that the 
    continued abuse of meperidine is most probably related to the east with which 
    it can be diverted from commercial channels rather than it's applicability 
    to drug abuse per se. It has been noted that there are some 4000 compounds 
    which may be related chemically to meperidine. 
    It should be pointed out that of these 4000 compounds, many are not classified 
    as analgesics, and they must also include the closely allied prodine and ketobemidone 
    derivatives. The most potent analgesics of the meperidine class of compounds, 
    as is the case with the prodine class of compounds, all appear to already 
    be controlled under Schedule I and the less potent but clinically useful derivatives 
    controlled under Schedule II. The most interesting compound from the view 
    point of clandestine synthesis would have to be phenoperidine, as analgesic 
    activity is approximately 30 times that of morphine and the safety margin 
    is increased, relative to meperidine, quite substantially<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>82</sup></a>. Fentanyl is an analgesic of high potency, approximately 
    300 times that of morphine, which was developed by Janssen in 1962<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>80</sup></a> and is <nobr>N-[(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidyl]-N-phenyl-propanamide</nobr>. 
    The first CsA of fentanyl came to the attention of law enforcement in late 
    1979 but was not identified until 1981<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
    In the next three years a procession of new fentanyl CsA's appeared in the 
    illicit drug market. The abuse of fentanyl CsA's peaked in 1985 and has since 
    decreased dramatically<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>58</sup></a>, a phenomena 
    which was the result of DEA successfully terminating the operation of the 
    responsible laboratories. However, the ripple effect is still being felt as 
    international and national meetings have been held to discuss the problems 
    presented by CsA's. Also, legislation, such as the U.S. CsA amendment, has 
    been passed in order to allow law enforcement to deal more efficiently with 
    the analog problem.</p>
  <p>It is the author's opinion that fentanyl CsA's will be back as the future 
    analgesic drugs of abuse. The thoughts behind this statement are that the 
    published synthesis schemes for the fentanyl compounds allow for the use of 
    wide variety of precursors as discovered by the confiscated notes from an 
    anonymous clandestine laboratory that synthesized a drug, based on information 
    presented in two separate volumes of the Journal of Organic Chemistry<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>6,79,117,161,162</sup></a>. Also, several fentanyl derivatives have such high potencies 
    that the quantities required to be synthesized are trivial. For instance, 
    carfentanil (<em>compound 53, Figure 17</em>) is approximately 4000 times 
    as potent as heroin and has an extremely favorable therapeutic index<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>82</sup></a>. Hence, an easy week's work for two chemists could provide 1 (one) 
    kilogram of carfentanil which would be equivalent to four metric tons of pure 
    heroin.</p>
  <p>In the course of this article, several points have been made concerning those 
    forces which will control the appearance of future synthetic drugs of abuse. 
    The most important of these factors is user acceptance of the marketed drug. 
    Needless to say, the typical clandestine drug dealer and/or chemist is not 
    overly concerned with the health of the user. However, they are concerned 
    with having a ready market for their product. A reputation for selling "bad 
    stuff" would not be conducive to good business. A recent example of this can 
    be found in MPPP.</p>
  <p>The second most important market controlling factor is law enforcement control 
    of the industry. A recent example would be the effects produced when P2P was 
    placed under legal controls. The response so far has been two-fold; first 
    there has been a concerted move to either more fundamental precursors or to 
    synthetic routes utilizing <nobr>&beta;-hydroxyphenylethylamines</nobr>, and second, there 
    has been an apparent increase in the abuse of <nobr>4-methylaminorex</nobr>. Hence, the 
    methamphetamine market is in a state of flux as a direct result of law enforcement 
    activity and either a CsA will be found which will provide both the user and 
    the clandestine drug chemist with the same advantages as methamphetamine or 
    a new precursor synthesis scheme will be found which will offer nearly the 
    same advantages as P2P. It is axiomatic that for drugs of moderate potency 
    arid high consumer demand, such as methamphetamine, a synthesis scheme must 
    be relatively straightforward as it must be amenable to the limited expertise 
    available in the clandestine laboratories in order to meet consumer demand.</p>
  <p>In this work, only an occasional attempt was made to address the difficulties 
    associated with the practical synthesis of the various derivatives discussed. 
    Some of the compounds discussed do not have conveniently configured precursors 
    that are commercially available. Hence, synthesis of some of these compounds 
    require using the precursors earth, fire, and water. Additionally, as the 
    number and complexity of substitution on any given chemical structure increases, 
    there is a corresponding increase in the number of byproducts and a decrease 
    in the ultimate yield of target compound. In total then, some of the compounds 
    mentioned in this work are not practical, especially considering the clandestine 
    laboratory, given the present state of synthetic knowledge. However, as time 
    moves on, more efficient and direct methods of synthesis will be found and 
    made available to the informed reader through the scientific literature. This 
    point is easily exemplified even by the work of our own forensic scientists<a href="future_drugs.html#refs"><sup>25,147</sup></a>. The clandestine chemist of the future will 
    be more sophisticated than those of the present and compounds not yet conceived 
    of will be within their reach.</p>
  <p>Consumer preferences and law enforcement activities are the two dominate 
    forces affecting today's illicit drug markets. While staying within the confines 
    of consumer demand, the clandestine chemist of the future will synthesize 
    those drugs having the highest possible potency in an effort to limit his 
    exposure to law enforcement activities and to expand his illicit business 
    as well.</p>
