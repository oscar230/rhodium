<p>The reaction of alkenes with iodine and silver acetate in moist acetic acid (Woodward's procedure) is the best method for the preparation of <em>cis</em>-diols with the hydroxyl groups on the more hindered side of the molecule.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Woodward's procedure the silver carboxylate is assumed to have a double function: <strong>i</strong>) to give an acyl hypoiodite that serves a a source of electrophilic iodine; <strong>ii</strong>) to facilitate the conversion of the acetylated <em>trans</em>-iodohydrin, formed in the addition step, into a dioxolenium ion that then leads to the <em>cis</em>-diol.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>We have now found that silver salt is not essential for neither  <strong>i</strong>) or <strong>ii</strong>) and have therefore developed a modified procedure that does not require this expensive reagent.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>
<p>By making use of a method analogous to a recently reported one,<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> 5&alpha;-cholest-2-ene was converted in an 86% yield to 2&beta;-acetoxy-3&alpha;-iodo-5&alpha;-cholestane, mp 95-97°C (lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 96-97°C), by reaction with iodine (0.50 moles) and potassium iodate (0.25 moles) in acetic acid solution at 60°C (2 hours).<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>When refluxed (1 hour) with silver acetate (1.1 moles) in moist acetic acid and then hydrolysed with alkali the acetylated <em>trans</em>-iodohydrin smoothly gave 5&alpha;-cholestan-2&beta;,3&beta;-diol, mp 177.5-179°C (lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> 177-179°C) in an 84% yield (lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> 82%). However, the diol could be also obtained by replacing silver acetate with an equivalent amount of either cupric acetate (87% yield) or potassium acetate (76% yield) and even simply refluxing (10 hours) the acetylated <em>trans</em>-iodohydrin in acetic acid-water (1:1) (76% yield). Obviously, the isolation of this intermediate is not necessary, as it may be seen from the following procedure, that leads to <em>cis</em>-diol directly from 5&alpha;-cholest-2-ene:</p>

<p>5&alpha;-cholest-2-ene (0.5 g, 1.35 mmoles), glacial AcOH (20 ml), KIO<sub>3</sub> (70 mg, 0.34 mmoles) and iodine (170 mg, 0.675 mmoles) were stirred at 60°C for 3 hr. AcOK (133 mg, 1.35 mmoles) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 hr. After cooling, water was added and the mixture was extracted thrice with <em>n</em>-hexane. The extracts were washed with water and evaporated to give a solid which was refluxed in benzene (10 ml) with KOH (2 ml of a 10% MeOH soln.). Usual work up gave a solid which by chromatography afforded pure 5&alpha;-cholestan-2&beta;,3&beta;-diol (390 mg, 70%) besides 60 mg of unreacted olefin.</p>
</div>

<p>The above procedure was essayed on two other representative olefins too. Thus, when reacted with iodine and potassium iodate in acetic acid at room temp for 5 hr. and then refluxed with potassium acetate for 7 hr. cyclohexene gave (after hydrolysis with alkali) <em>cis</em>-1,2-cyclohexandiol mp 97.5°C (86% yield; lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 70%), gas chromatographically free from the trans-isomer. Analogously, from oleic acid (24 h at RT and then 6 h reflux) a 63.5% yield (lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 56%) of <em>erythro</em>-9,10-dihydroxystearic acid mp 126-129°C (lit.<a href="alkene2diol.i2-kio3.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> 127-129°C) was obtained after hydrolysis with alkali.</p>

<p>Owing to its simplicity and to the yields more than comparable with those of the classical Woodward's reaction the present procedure should be the method of choice for the olefins <em>cis</em>-hydroxylation.</p>
