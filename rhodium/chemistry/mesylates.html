  <p>Reactive sulfonate esters are especially useful because of their synthetic 
    versatility and ability to initiate carbonium ion reactions. The usual Tipson 
    procedure<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> is not suited for the synthesis 
    of reactive sulfonate esters owing to facile alkylation of the solvent, pyridine, 
    by the products<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. For the synthesis of propargyl 
    brosylates and tosylates, this side reaction has been suppressed by the use 
    of excess 2,6-lutidine in DCM solution<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, and 
    in the case of benzyl tosylates, by reaction of tosyl chloride with the appropriate 
    lithium<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> or sodium<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> 
    alkoxide. Although very reactive species my be prepared by these procedures, 
    the relatively long reaction times (days) of the former and the strongly basic 
    conditions of the latter seem to limit both procedures to products which are 
    stable to elimination. Another successful procedure for the preparation of 
    reactive tosylates is reaction of the corresponding alkyl iodide with silver 
    tosylate<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. Both benzyl and branched chain tosylates 
    may be prepared by this method; however, the stereochemistry of the product 
    is uncertain. Recently Coates and Chen have published a synthesis of reactive 
    tosylates which involves oxidation of the corresponding sulfinates with m-chlorobenzoic 
    acid in DCM solution<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>. This method appears 
    to have general applicability, although, from the corresponding alcohol, two 
    synthetic steps are required. The method also seems to be restricted to molecules 
    not containing easily oxidized functionalities.

  <p>For some time we have synthesized methanesulfonate esters (mesylates) from 
    the corresponding alcohols using a procedure based on the mechanistic studies 
    of Truce<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>. We wish to report the experimental 
    details of this procedure which is extraordinarily simple and rapid and appears 
    to be of diverse applicability. <strong>Table I</strong> lists some of the 
    mesylates prepared by this procedure. Repetitive integration of the 60MHz 
    <sup>1</sup>H nmr spectra showed that in each case the product was over 95% 
    esterified. No by-products were observed. Our procedure deviates from the 
    usual Tipson procedure<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> by the use of triethylamine 
    as base and DCM as solvent. In the light of recent evidence<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>, 
    it is apparent that the mechanistic course of the reaction has been changed 
    from the usual nucleophilic addition to the alcohol to the sulfonyl group 
    to an addition of the alcohol to the sulfene<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> 
    derived from mesyl chloride by the <em>E2</em> elimination of HCl<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>. 
    The facile esterification of a number of tertiary and neopentyl systems (<strong>Table 
    I</strong>) indicates that the reagent has a small steric requirement. The 
    nucleophilicity of the alcohol is unimportant as shown by the ready esterification 
    of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Furthermore, 
    conditions are sufficiently mild that even very reactive systems such as 1-methylcyclobutyl<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> 
    and <em>alpha</em>-phenyethyl may be esterified. Indeed, in our experience, 
    all alcohols are esterfied by this procedure; the limiting factor seems to 
    be the stability of the product<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>We have found mesylates to be quite useful as synthetic intermediates. They 
    are about three times less reactive towards solvolysis than the corresponding 
    tosylates<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>. With suitably unhindered systems, 
    mesylates are easily displaced by nucleophiles such as halide or hydride<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a>. 
    In the latter case, where reduction is performed with excess LAH in ether, 
    mesylates are especially useful because the mesylate fragment reduce to methyl 
    mercaptan, which is easily removed.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h5>Preparation of Mesylates:</h5>

    <p>To an approximately 0.2M solution of the alcohol in DCM<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> 
      solution containing a 50% molar excess of triethylamine, kept at between 
      0°C and -10°C, was added a 10% excess of methanesulfonyl chloride (mesyl 
      chloride) over a period of 5-10 minutes<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>. 
      Stirring for an additional 10-15 minutes completed the reaction. The reaction 
      mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel with the aid of more DCM. 
      The mix was first extracted with ice water, followed by cold 10% HCl acid, 
      sat. sodium bicarbonate, sat. brine. Drying the DCM solution followed by 
      solvent removal gave the product<a href="mesylates.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a>, which 
      was pure enough for most uses, including solvolysis.</p>
