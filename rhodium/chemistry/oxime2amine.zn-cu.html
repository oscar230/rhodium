  <h2>Reduction of Oximes to Amines<br>Using a Zinc-Copper Couple</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>An efficient and short synthesis of [1-amino-2-(3-indolyl)-ethyl]-phosphonic 
      acid (<strong>1</strong>), the phosphonic acid analog of tryptophan, from 
      indole-3-acetic acid which utilizes a novel zinc-copper couple reduction 
      of an oxime is described.</p>
</div>

  <p>The phosphorous analogs of &alpha;-amino acids have been studied extensively 
    due to the finding that these class of molecules often have interesting biological 
    activities ranging from plant growth regulators<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> 
    to antibacterial agents<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. In addition, the 
    incorporation of these molecules into small peptides have produced potent 
    inhibitors of a variety of enzymes of medicinal importance<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
    Thus, the 1-aminophosphonic acids represents a useful and interesting series 
    of compounds.</p>

<h4>Scheme 1</h4>
</div>

  <p>Several good methods for the synthesis of these compounds have been reported. 
    For instance, the diaryl esters of a variety of amino acid analogs can be 
    prepared by a two step synthesis from benzyl carbamate, aldehyde, and triphenylphosphine<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 
    or via aminomethylphosphonate schiff base intermediates<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. 
    In addition, oxidation of the corresponding phosphinic acids have also been 
    reported<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. However, noticeably absent from 
    the literature are reports of an efficient synthesis of the phosphonic acid 
    analog of tryptophan <strong>1</strong>. The single reported synthesis of 
    <strong>1</strong> proceeds in poor yield (10%), requires the isolation of 
    reactive indole-3-acetyl chloride <strong>2</strong> and suffers a cumbersome 
    Al-Hg reduction of oxime <strong>4</strong><a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. 
    Thus, we wish to report a more efficient synthesis of j which eliminates the 
    need for the isolation of <strong>1</strong> and relies on a novel Zn-Cu reduction 
    of <strong>4</strong> (Scheme <strong>1</strong>). While our synthesis follows 
    that of Subotkowski et. al., in general, it is important to note that our 
    improved method provides higher overall yields (20%) and begins with commercially 
    available indole-3-acetic acid.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>
    <p>Indole-3-acetyl chloride <strong>2</strong>, was generated from indole-3-acetic 
      acid using oxalyl chloride (1.1 eq.) in refluxing methylene chloride which 
      contained 0.3% DMF by volume. After a solvent exchange to anhydrous diethyl 
      ether the acid chloride was reacted with triethyl phosphite (1 eq.) at room 
      temperature to generate the Arbuzov product, keto-phosphonate (<strong>3</strong>) 
      which precipitates out of ether as a white solid in 56% yield. This compound 
      exists primarily in the enolate form, as identified by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR. 
      The keto-phosphonate was converted to the oxime (<strong>4</strong>) upon 
      treatment with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.3 eq.) and pyridine (1.5 eq.) 
      in absolute ethanol at room temperature. The ethanol was removed and the 
      reaction was treated with 1 N HCl and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. 
      The organic layer was cooled to 0°C which caused <strong>4</strong> to precipitate 
      out as a white solid in 76% yield. Initially, the reduction of the oxime 
      to the amine was performed with an aluminum amalgam<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. 
      However, the poor yields (20-40%) of the reaction and the large quantities 
      of mercury waste generated indicated that a better route was needed. Hydrogenation 
      over Raney-Nickel proved ineffective. It was found that the reduction of 
      the oxime to the racemic amine <strong>5</strong> could be accomplished 
      in good yield (69%) using zinc-copper couple in warm aqueous ethanol with 
      ultrasonic agitation<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. This novel method 
      for the reduction of oximes is vastly preferable to the aluminum-amalgam 
      reductions previously reported. Finally, the cleavage of the phosphonate 
      esters to form <strong>1</strong> was accomplished in 68% yield with TMSI, 
      generated in situ by the reaction of TMSBr and KI in acetonitrile<a href="oxime2amine.zn-cu.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
</div>

  <p>In summary, tryptophan phosphonic acid was synthesized in five steps from 
    indole-3-acetic acid. This procedure has advantages over the previously published 
    route in that the critical acid chloride is generated in situ and the Al-Hg 
    reduction was replaced with a more efficient zinc-copper couple method. These 
    advantages make this scheme amenable to production of large quantities of 
    <strong>1</strong>.</p>
