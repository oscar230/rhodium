<A NAME="what"><H1><CENTER>What is Methcathinone?</a></CENTER></H1>
<P>
the designer drug 'methcathinone HCl' is also known as Cat, Jeff, Mulka 
or Ephedrone.
<P>
It is a schedule-1 stimulant, making it flat-out illegal like Heroin or LSD
(Methamphetamine, on the other hand, is LEGAL with a valid triplicate
prescription.)
<P>
Chemically, Methcathinone is 2-(methylamino)propiophenone. The name
Methcathinone is derived from the name of the drug cathinone, obviously,
which in turn is derived from "cathine", an alternate name for
norpseudephedrine, an isomer of phenpropanolamine. The name "Ephedrone"
is obviously derived from the fact that "Ephedrone" is the ketone of the
alcohol that is Ephedrine.
<P>
Structure: Contrast the molecules for a quick idea of their comparison.
Pseudephedrine or ephedrine would probably be a rightous high as well if
it werent for the fact that hydroxyl (OH) groups have such a difficult
time crossing the blood-brain barrier.

</PRE>
Pseudephedrine and ephedrine differ only in the isomerism of the OH group. 
While this makes dramatic difference in the drugs activities at both beta
receptors and/or its ability to enter the brain, and does create a difference
in the base (not salt) form's soluability in water, since we wont be working
in a strongly basic solution, and we WILL be eliminating the chirality at
this carbon, for the most part it probably doesnt matter which precursor 
is used. Pseudephedrine was used here because its cheaper, more readily
available in easily extractable form, and not watched by the jackbooted thugs
at the DEA.
<P>
<A NAME="theory"><H1><CENTER>The KMnO4 Synthesis: Theory and Background</a></CENTER></H1>
<P>
This synthesis uses KMnO4, a damn strong oxidizer that under most
conditions might not be the ideal reagent for this synthesis, but when
treated with some degree of respect, will work extremely well.
<P>
This synthesis relies on two principles understandable by anyone who's had 
chemistry at the college level.. or any experience with chemicals at all.
Even baking a cake.
<P>
There's two other synthesises making their way about the net, that I am
aware of. The first uses the less potent CHROMATES [which are more toxic]
at room temperature, and the second uses KMnO4 with a variety of other
weird things and conditions - albeit at room temperature.
<P>
Seeking to avoid the chromates while also avoiding using a lot of
more advanced technique and equipment, leaves only one option. Slowing
KMnO4 down to a reasonable rate.
<P><PRE>
1. The reaction in the FAQ is dilluted considerably...
2. The reaction in the FAQ is done way colder than any other cat synth.
</PRE><P>
Presto, the two key elements to changing the rate of a reaction. The end
result is quite pleasing and economical, and the reaction is about as
fast as the chromate recipe.
<P>
Other than that, the only commentary on the recipe is that its a standard
alcohol to ketone oxidization proceedure for the most part. Yield, when
measured is likely to vary according due to a few things:
<P><PRE>
1. The efficiency of the pseudephedrine extraction employed.
2. Temperature of the reaction - higher temperatures are far more apt
   to yield side product [deamination?] which will be lost.
3. Care taken during solvent "wash" of final product.
4. Realize that KCl is a very likely to be present in the final product.
   and adjust estimated yield from weight accordingly.

<A NAME="objectives"><STRONG>Synthesis Objectives</a></STRONG>
<P>
The objective of this procedure is to produce methcathinone in a reletively
pure form. This was accomplished as evidenced by a residue/burn test, and
quite a few testimonials from users. A secondary objective was to not
require complicated lab proceedures - avoiding even an acid-base extraction
and to stray away from toxic byproducts.
<P>
Upon completion, your methcathinone should be "pure" with a small potassium
supplement...
<P> 
The methcathinone produced by this proceedure is no doubt not as pure as
that which may be produced using a typical acid-base solvent extraction,
but certainly rivals it nicely. And the conditions required for this method
are far less demanding, as none of the toxic chromates are used.
<P>
<A NAME="ingredients"><STRONG>Synthesis Ingredients</a></STRONG>
<P><PRE>
Collander w/ reletively small holes
Shaved Ice
Pseudephedrine tablets, 100 of 30mg each.
Reasonably pure KMnO4 (Potassium Permaganate). Avoid lead and other toxins.
Distilled water. <STRONG>TAP WATER WILL FAIL!!!</STRONG> Purified water usually works.
Refridgerator chilled to just over 0c (most are).
Small turkey Baster or other method of measuring water in mililiter quantities.
An area heated or chilled to "room temperature" (ROUGHLY 25c or 75f)
Isopropanol for quenching KMnO4... 70% to 100% is OK if its clear.
Ethanol optional for speeding drying process.
Acetone for the washing of crystals.
</PRE><P> 
Most kitchens do NOT come equipped with a scale capable of measureing
individual grams, let alone miligrams. And in many states, possession of
such a finely tuned instrument, while not a crime, certainly is admissable
as one of many items of evidence to be used in a criminal investigation.
Definitly something to be avoided. Keep all the ingredients and all the 
labware in its "everday-use" place, and there's no evidence to support the
existance of a cat lab. And no need to manufacture the stuff in the high
desert regions either, since weird scents are for the most part avoided.
<P>
<A NAME="extract"><STRONG>Extracting Pseudephedrine HCl</a></STRONG>
<P>
(kudo's to POPeye for his document "Getting the Red out")
100 of the 30mg generic pseudephedrine tablets were placed into a collander
containing about the same "volume" of crushed ice. They were swirled around
in this collander over a sink (with running water to wash the color down
the drain) until all the ice had melted and washed thru. The tablets were
then rinsed once with distilled water, and removed to a glass jar for
extracting.
<P><STRONG>
NOTE: The running water kept the drain clean, but wasn't ever in contact
with the tablets themselves. This confused a number of people. Obviously,
its not necessary for this... just convienent I guess.
Do not wash the tablets UNDER WATER with crushed ice. Rather, place 
them in the colander with crushed ice, thats it, and stir them around,.. 
The very cold ice does a minimum of disolving WHILE its abrasion removes 
the coloring.
</STRONG><P>
Place the just washed and probably slightly red pseudephedrine tablets in
a jar, and pour 150mL of water over them. Now heat this in a microwave at
low power until it gets "hot" but not boiling. Stir the crap until the
tablets fall all to pieces, then let the powdery FILLER material settle,
leaving pseudephedrine in solution all by its lonesome, or at least mostly
by its lonesome.
<P>
Slowly pour this THRU coffee filter into another jar. 
<P>
When this is done, scrape/shake/get any powder caught in the filler and
stick it in the FIRST jar, the one that might have some sludge at the
bottom still. Now add another 150mL of water, heat until "hot", stir, then
let settle. Pour this thru the coffee filter.
<P>
Get the powder stuck in the filter (again) back with the sludge and add
still another 150mL and heat until "hot". This time pour thru the filter,
and your done.
<P>
It is worth noting that the filler material clogs the filters and will
dramatically increase time for filteration to take place, like from 30
seconds to 30 minutes. The enlightened will at once realize that the
easiest way to avoid this is to decant, or pour slowly so as not to disturb
the sludge at the bottom, the solution thru the filter first, waiting until
its really necessary to dump the sludge onto the filter. Also, avoid dumping
"dry" sludge onto the filter, the only sludge that ought to be on the filter
is that which became dispersed in the water while pouring. In an ideal world,
everyones kitchen would have a centrifuge (and a miligram scale too!) and
this wouldnt be a problem, but then again in an ideal world we would be able
to buy our drugs over the counter, and not have to make them. Suffice to say
this isnt an ideal world.
<P>
<A NAME="measure"><STRONG>Measuring and preparing the KMnO4 solution</a></STRONG>
<P>
KMnO4 is saturated at 25c in water - 100ml of solution holds 7.43g
This time I will be using just under 3g of pseudephedrine (if extract
was perfect would be exactly 3g pseudephedrine). Keep in mind that when
preparing the saturated solution you need room temperature and time -
you need to let the crystals settle!!! Excess (undisolved) KMnO4 will 
stay "swirled in" the solution. Let it settle for a while at room temp, 
_then_ measure the 15mL or so... Failure to do this will result in a failed
synthesis. If you are too impatient to do this, then you should purchase a
miligram-quantity scale.
<P>
In acid conditions, 1 mole of KMnO4 will oxidize 5 hydrogens.
In basic conditions, 1 mole of KMnO4 will oxidize 3 hydrogens.
We won't be specifically using either, because KMnO4 also works nicely
under neutral conditions.
<P>
It can be reasonably anticipated that the Pseudephedrine HCl will posess
somewhat of an acidic character, so we will 'assume' acidic conditions,
which also will allow us to avoid using TOO MUCH KMnO4... small amounts of
pseudephedrine will go unnoticed in the final product, but gooey messes
will not, for obvious reasons.
<P>
The Pseudephedrine/KMnO4 ratio should be 2.5Mole to 1Mole, according to
previous calculations. 3g pseudephedrine is 18.15mMole, therefore 7.26mMole
of KMnO4, or 1.148g will be needed for the reaction. This means that 
15.45mL of concentrated solution at room temperature will be needed.
Obviously us kitchen chemists can't be that precise, so aim a little high,
as previous margins were set about 10% low... use AT LEAST 15.45mL prepared
at AT LEAST 25c.
<P>
<A NAME="prepare"><STRONG>Preparing for the Cold Reaction</a></STRONG>
<P>
This 15.5 or so mL of solution is then diluted with 250mL H2O, and is 
started chilling in a refridgerator, with just over 0c the goal. 
Place the pseudephedrine solution in the fridge to chill, next to the 
KMnO4 solution. Label the jar so that in the event you are raided during
the proceedure, the feds will know which evidence is which and have a
handwriting sample to implicate you in the manufacturing process. Leave
the jars to chill (at least 4 hours, maybe more. Check temperature if your
unsure - it ought to be just slightly above 0c or 32f)
<P> 
And for the next few hours, nothing happens. This is a good time to stop
for lunch, if your into eating.
<P><STRONG>
It should be noted at this point that much feedback has been recieved
from "failed" synthesis caused entirely by not letting the mixture chill
long enough. If your impatient, place it in the freezer until ice begins
to form then allow it to warm just enough to melt before mixing
remember, the ONLY reason this works at all is because the dilution
and temperature are such that the permaganate oxidizes the alcohol to a
ketone and GETS USED UP before it can do anything damage. Make the solution
much more concentrated or much warmer, and these guarantees may not work.
</STRONG><P>
<P>
<A NAME="react"><STRONG>The Reaction (the boring part??)</a></STRONG>
<P>
After chilling, the two cold solutions are mixed together, stirred, and 
replaced in the fridge overnight (8-12 hours). This is a good time to
stop and have dinner, pork your significant other, and then get some sleep.
<P>
In the morning, instead of a PURPLE color in the jar, there is a mostly
clear layer, and a brownish gunk on the bottom, which agitates easily.
Because its safer to err on the side of caution, 100mL of 70% isopropyl
alcohol is added and stirred. 
<P>
If a purple color remains, odds are that an EXCESS of KMnO4 was used and
the synthesis will fail, or that not enough time was allowed for the
reaction to take place. Do not allow more than 12 hours in any case,
instead give the KMnO4 something else to chew on [the isopropyl alcohol].
This is the sole reason for the addition of isopropanol. Ethanol or
methanol were not used because they tend to oxidize further to substances
not so easily seperated from the product. Any acetone made from the 
isopropanol will evaporate easily.
<P>
Let the mixture sit for roughtly 2 hours on a shelf, and at the end of
this period it should be around room temperature. Time to room temp will
vary with dimentions and thickness of the container, of course.
<P>
This mixture is filtered thru two coffee filters stacked on top of each
other with the intention of catching all the little maganeese particles
that have precipitated. In an ideal world, you can do this on the first
try and get a perfectly clear liquid on the bottom. In a less than ideal
world, it was necessary to again RECOOL SLIGHTLY the filtered mix, and
filter this thru another pair of coffee filters. My hunch is that the
slight cooling in the fridge, and/or the extra time allowed the rest of the
maganeese to 'clump' together into pieces too big to escape unfiltered.
<P><STRONG>
Many have found two, three, or even four refiltrations to be necessary
apparently the choice in coffee filter places a dramatic role. The truly
patient chemist could use a PAPER filter, provided it is free of anything
that would end up in the mixture, such as coloring. The well equiped chemist
would use a paper filter and a vaccuum suction device that would pull the
stuff thru the filter paper, but hopefully not rip it. Perhaps such a device
could be built in a manner similar to a bomb, with the place where the mouth
goes used to hold the filter, and the place where the bowl goes hooked up
to some kind of suction (an aspirator, mini vaccuum, I dunno). The contents
of the bong would be the desired part...
<PRE>

  |  '/        it to fill completely would be potentially waste product on
  |~~|         the vaccuum rig. 
 _|__|_
</PRE>
The bong idea is totally untried, but it seems like a sound idea.
<P></STRONG>
This final, filtered solution was found to be basic with a pool test kit,
no suprise if you figure that the HCl part of the Pfed was used up in the
oxidation as 'acid'. Results will vary on the final pH. If its already acidic,
you dont need to add any more acid (heheh).
<P><STRONG>
Most have found a pool test kit woefully inadequate, and have suggested
using pH paper. I almost wonder if the amateur pH meter made from boiling
red cabbages wouldnt be better than a pool test kit, as it is also wide
range. See Mr. Wizard or any high school chemistry book for details.
</STRONG><P>
<P>
<A NAME="purify"><STRONG>Purification - making glittering white crystals</a></STRONG>
<P>
If not yet, during this part of the proceedure you will definitly smell
the methcathinone. It has a stronger odor than methamphetamine, BUT the
odor of methcathinone is _pleasant_, even to those who have not experienced
the drug (some people LEARN to like certain smells, but cat just smells
plain good.)
<P><STRONG>
The smell has been most closely likened to pistacio ice cream, of all
things. Will wonders never cease...
</STRONG><P>
Considering the fact that there's either isopropanol or acetone in the
above mixture, its probably not a wise idea to just load your rig straight
from it and shoot. And considering you might want to give some of your
creation away, it'd sure be nice to have a transportable form.
<P><STRONG>
NOTE: A *very small* amount of conc. HCl is required. Add it one drop
at a time with stiring.
</STRONG><P>
Now to make sure the stuff is indeed the HCl form...
<P> 
Add HCl with stiring to adjust the pH to slightly acidic, i.e. just under
7 (like 5 - 6.5). This will ensure that Methcathinone HCl is produced, and
not the freebase, which can decompose easily. While the original FAQ
suggesting using a pool test kit to measure the change in pH across
a very narrow range, many people haven't got this to work, and instead a
less sensitive agent [pH paper?] is reccomended. Perhaps even the classic
"red cabbage" pH tester will work... see any kids chemistry book for more
details on this plant-based pH test... In any case, if its concentrated HCl,
add it ONE DROP AT A TIME with stiring and checking of the pH. If you add
too much HCl, the crystals wont seem to dry out properly. Fear not, place
them in a freezer or some such, then take them out let them thaw & dry more,
they will eventually freeze *after* the excess HCl moves into the atmosphere.
<P>
Pour the stuff into a glass (PYREX!) brownie dish. Place on a stove and
heat gently from below _while_ blowing lightly with a hair dryer (avoid
splashing - it wastes drugs and leaves residue.) Eventually there will
start to be a really really thick gooey mess. Adding methanol or ethanol
to this thins it while speeding the drying process - a definite plus. In
my case, ethanol was used, although methanol may be preferable. Doing
this is probably a must to dry the crystals at a reasonable temperature
in a reasonable amount of time, unless you happen to have a vaccuum pump
lying around....
<P><STRONG> 
While it would seem that adding liquid would increase drying time, this
is not the case because the alcohol helps remove water from the crystals -
almost dry crystals can be heated very hot and still not dry. For best
results do not add the extra alcohol until the drying stuff is kinda thick,
or the first crystals have started to form.
</STRONG><P>
Be careful not to overheat the crystals. If they MELT, you've almost
definitly screwed up.... :)
<P>
Washing the crystals with acetone _is_ a possibility but can dramatically
reduce yields, as Methcathinone HCl is apparently pretty soluable in the
stuff. Just save the acetone and let it dry all alone, somewhere, for a
product that is smokable but too oily to chop & sniff... Methcathinone is
easily recovered from an 'acetone-wash' by slow evaporation, and such
recovered globs/hunks/crystals/slime/ooze/whatever you get should be saved
and washed again, to recover any lost crystals.
<P>
Strangely, certain solvents will affect the potency of the end product.
Disolution of the base in methanol will result in racemization! If you
are especially (dis/) pleased with the results of a particular batch and 
can't figure out why, think back to what solvents were used in drying and/or
washing. 
<P>
<A NAME="testing"><H1><CENTER>Testing your CAT</a></CENTER></H1>
<P>
BURN:
A burn-test of acetone-washed methcathinone left almost NO residue. The
methcathinone HCl was heated over methane flame in a spoon. It first
melted, then began boiling, and finally literally BURST INTO FLAMES and was
gone except for a spot where the spoon was possibly corroded.
<P> 
A burn-test of the oily methcathinone from the acetone wash which evaporated
(and would have been lost had I not kept the byproduct of the acetone wash)
performed the same way! Its oily nature prevented clean chopping, but upon
washing with ethyl-ether good product was formed from this oily cat.
<P>
A burn-test of ether cleaned acetone-wash extract left nothing behind but a
slight discoloring of the shiny part of the spoon, probably due again to
reaction with the HCl or reaction with air catalysed by the salt nature of
the crystals (?)
<P> 
TASTE:
Bitter. No evidence of numbing of the tounge or sinuses was evidenced.
Snorting the product produced intense burning feelings in the nostrils,
stronger than saline solution or (laughably, I did this once to prove a
point) sugar (which doesnt feel at all!), about as much sting as with
methamphetamine, and no where near as much sting as was once obtained
from snorting diphenhydramine concentrated from benedryl (a very stupid
experiment in nasal congestion...)
<P>
SMELL:
Typical of a ketone - sweet. Once report says it smells like "pistaccio
ice cream" when wet. The dry crystals dont smell all that much, but it
doesnt take a genius to realize that once they get dogs trained for this
stuff detection will be simple.
<P>
The melting point of the HCl form is 182-184c according to listing below.
The CAT produced in this proceedure melted somewhere withing plus or minus
ten degrees of this temperature, the thermometer wasnt all to great...
<P>
<A NAME="commentary"><H1><CENTER>Comentary on CAT</a></CENTER></H1>
<P>
Methcathinone was used as an antidepressant in the former soviet union. This
almost makes good sense, as even in abuse doses the 'hangover' is nowhere
near as severe as with the amphetamines. Indeed, bupropion, a close chemical
relative, is used as an antidepressant in todays United States.
<P>
Methcathinone was considered by one company for marketing in the United
States as an antidepressant in the 1950's, but was shelved due to
"severe side effects". If you've ever taken Imipramine or another TCA, or
know of the pharmacology of the MAOI antidepressants, you really wonder
about the truth of this statement. The "severe side effect" that shelved the
project was no doubt addiction and abuse, not an actual physiological side
effect...
<P>
If I had to characterize the drug, I would say it induces mania more so
than methamphetamine, but psychosis much less. The initial dose produced
some paranoia, but subsequent doses did not make this worse (?) and in
fact seemed to lessen it. This is definitly a drug for goofing off, unlike
methamphetamine which makes one 'serious'.
<P>
Methamphetamine may dramatically help certain peoples academic and or
business careers, but it doesnt appear likely that methcathinone would do
this, as it increases distractability rather than decreases it.

No dilation of the pupils was noticed at any level (?!?), however both
pulse rate and blood pressure were up quite a bit. Upon sniffing, mouth
instantly "watered", and thru the experience my mouth did not become dry.
So +/-cholinergic side effects appear absent, unlike either amphetamines or
cocaine.
<P> 
When the drug wears off, sleep is much easier to obtain. The first night
after a day of CATting I slept very well, but after the next day of the
same I awakened after only 2 hours of sleep and had to take diphenhydramine
to return to sleep. 
<P>
Withdrawl is characterized by sadness and feelings of despair, along with 
a lack of energy. Others have reported a physical withdrawl, but these 
reports come from the highDose michaganCatNut crowd. Alternately felt
hopeless or giddy and almost euphoric. Caffeine appears to dramatically
alleviate the depression.

Data indicates this is a less potent drug, but this is easily remedied by
taking more (obviously) and different people may or may not prefer a
slightly different side effect profile, etc etc etc.

Diethylpropion  -  Tenuate, a C-4 (USA) diet pill
<P>
If you can produce diethylphenpropanolamine, you can use it in the above
reaction to produce Diethylpropion, although the time involved makes it
doubtful that you'd want to - this drug is not all that potent or
interesting. DEPPA could probably be produced in decent yields via a 
controlled temperature reaction with base, PPA and chloroethane, although
I have no idea what conditions would be ideal. Expected sideproducts would
be unchanged PPA, EtPPA, and (Et3)PPA+ ions...
<P> 
Bupropion       -  Wellbutrin, an unscheduled (USA) antidepressant
<P>
Nope. meta-Chloro,N-tert-butyl-Cathinone, or bupropion, would no doubt be
problematic due to the meta-chloro grouping - difficult to produce in a
home environment, if not damn near impossible, and probably a point of
side reactions if the ephedrine of the compound were to be oxidized.
Additionally, abuse potential for Bupropion is probably lower than that of
even caffeine. Caged rhesus monkeys will slam it, but think about the
condition of their life: In such a miserable state anything must be a
relief.

Synthesis & Info from above article follows:
<P>
[comment: I really *do not* like this synthesis]
A 2000-mL Erlenmeyer flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, was
charged with methylene chloride (200 mL), acetic acid (10 mL) water 
(100 mL), potassium permanganate (2g) and ephedrine hydrochloride (2g).  
The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min.  This was 
followed by the addition of sufficient sodium hydrogen sulfite to reduce 
the precipitated manganese dioxide.  The aqueous phase was made basic
with 5N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and the methylene chloride was
separated.  The organic layer was extracted with 0.5N sulfuric acid
(H2SO4).  Isolation of the acid layer followed by basification with
sodium bicarbonate and extraction with methylene chloride (50 mL,
three times), removed the product into the organic phase.  The solvent
was concentrated by rotary evaporation, followed by column
chromatography through neutral alumina with methylene chloride.
Solvent removal through rotary evaporation produced a colorless
liquid which was disolved in hexane.  Gaseous hydrochloric acid was
bubbled into the hexane to precipitate the amine hydrochloride to
produce a 1-g (50%) yield of 2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-one
hydrochloride.

Ephedrone, like methamphetamine, processes one asymmetric center.
Depending upon the synthetic precursor, l-ephedrine (1R,2S) or
d-pseudoephedrine (1S,2R), the product expected would be d-ephedrone
(2S) or l-ephedrone (2R), respectively.  However, depending on the
heat of the reaction or harsh extraction conditions the enolizable
ketone will result in a racemic d,l-ephedrone.

[This is the "classic" recipe using the chromates as oxidizers]
<P>
A solution composed of 0.99g of sodium dichromate and 133g of
concentrated sulfuric acid dissolved in 4.46 cc of water is added
slowly with stirring to 1.65g of l-ephedrine dissolved in 4.7 cc of
water and 0.55 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature.
The mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 4 to 6
hours and then made alkaline with sodium hydroxide soloution.  the
aqueous mixture is extracted with two volumes of chloroform and then
with two volumes of ether.  The organic extracts containing the free
base of 1-a-methylaminoprophenone are combined, treated with an
excess of dry hydrogen chloride and the solvents evaporated.  The
residual 1-a-methylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride is stirred with
petroleum ether, collected and purified by dissolving in ethanol and
reprecipitating with ether. m.p. 182-184 o C.

This article basically warns of methcathinone appearing on the streets.  
Notable claims are that the typical dosage is .5 to 1 gram a day (!!!) and
that addicts describe long-lasting intoxicating effects of up to 6 days
(I would assume this is repeated administration...). The article also states
that "cat" costs US$100 per gram (!whatever!), and goes on to reccomend
benzodiazepines for addicts (yay!) but antipsychotics for those who have
overdone it and schiz'd out (boo!). The article also indicates that
tolerance develops and disapates rapidly, something that happens with just
about any stimulant, even caffeine... abstract follows immiadetly belowed,
copied indirectly from MEDLINE.
<PRE>
TI  - Methcathinone: a new and potent amphetamine-like agent.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effect of
      N-monomethylation of phenylisopropylamine derivatives on amphetamine-
      like activity. In tests of stimulus generalization using rats trained
      to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of (+)-amphetamine from saline, the N-
      monomethyl derivatives of 1-(X-phenyl)-2-aminopropane, where X = 2,4-
      dimethoxy (2,4-DMA), 3,4-dimethoxy (3,4-DMA), 2,4,5-trimethoxy
      (2,4,5,-TMA), and 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy (MMDA-2), did not
      produce amphetamine-appropriate responding at the doses evaluated.
      However, the N-monomethyl derivative of cathinone (i.e.,
      methcathinone), like cathinone, resulted in stimulus generalization.
      Further studies with this agent revealed that (a) in the amphetamine-
      trained animals, methcathinone (ED50 = 0.37 mg/kg) is more potent
      than racemic cathinone or racemic amphetamine (ED50 = 0.71 mg/kg in
      both cases), (b) methcathinone is capable of inducing release of
      radioactivity from [3H]dopamine-prelabeled tissue of rat caudate
      nucleus in a manner similar to that observed with cathinone,
      amphetamine, and methamphetamine, and (c) methcathinone is more
      potent than cathinone as a locomotor stimulant in mice as determined
      by their effect on spontaneous activity. The results of the present
      study provide evidence for a structural analogy between the
      prototypic psychostimulants amphetamine/methamphetamine and
      cathinone/methcathinone, and lend further support to the concept that
      amphetamine and cathinone correspond in their pharmacological
      effects.

Regarding CATHINONE and the Khat Plant:

<P>
This article contains a number of political interpretations, but also
states of methcathinone "Its users report euphoria and increased alertness, 
although their concentration and judgement are objectively impaired." 
This fits nicely with my observation that Methcathinone is not useful as 
a drug for treating ADHD - amphetamine will improve ability to concentrate.

<A NAME="questions"><H1><CENTER>Frequent Questions & Answers</a></CENTER></H1>
<P>
The following are some questions I have recieved about this synthesis,
They have been paraphrased for brevity.
<PRE>
> I notice all the generic phenpropanolamine I've come across contains 
> vitamin c.  Would it be necessary to extract that first to make cathinone?
</PRE>
Yes, you must remove the vitamin C.
There is little doubt in my mind that such a compound could make a simple 
oxidation into a gooey hell. Antoxidant that it is, Vitamin C may be in 
there to keep the stuff from oxidizing on the shelves... some catHeads 
have noticed that ground sudafed from Burroughs Wellcome has a very mild 
methcathinone smell to it.... weird, no?
<PRE>
> What brand of pseudephedrine is best???
</PRE>
HINT: The smaller the pill, the less filler material it has.
Your safest bet on this one is to find out for yourself. Compared to just
about anything else in this world, pseudephedrine is cheap. Purchase and
find out.
<PRE>
> Is there any faster or less labor-intensive method of drying a batch?
</PRE>
An informed netter replies:<P>
You are absolutely right. I "understand" that placing the "stuff" into a 
glass casserole dish, then immersing in a double boiler setup does the job 
much nicer, while still being well within the means of the average kitchen. 
The main things to keep in mind are the addition of ethanol to thin the 
stuff while drying, and the use of a large surface area, to promote moving
solvent into the air, both water and ethanol. 
<PRE>
> What of I.V. usage of the drug produced from this method?
</PRE>
I wouldn't reccomend it as this method avoids an acid-base extraction.
While certainly less toxic than the chromates, injection of "other"
material ought to be avoided.
<PRE>
> This is the same method of making cat that you wrote up some time ago, 
> but you said that it (the synthesis you typed up) was crap. Is this 
> synthesis the same as the one you were using? (I never read yours)
</PRE>
Not the same by any stretch of the imagination. All the difference in the
world results from using exact amounts of KMnO4, highly diluted, and in
an extremely chilled condition.
<PRE>
> The FAQ said 70% isopropanol, can this % be varied?
</PRE>
Yes, that is just fine [esp. since its being added to a water-containing 
solution anyways :) The purpose is to provide "something else" [another 
alcohol] to be oxidized so that the Methcathinone won't get chewed up if
any oxidizer remains...
<P>
Do not substitue another alcohol for this *unless* it is a "secondary"
alcohol. Primary alcohols like ethanol and methanol can oxidize further
to substances that will not evaporate from the mixture as easily. The
isopropanol will oxidize to acetone, which evaporates easily.
<PRE>
> What drug-salts of methcathinone are there?
</PRE>
The HCl form is the easiest and probably safest sniffable form. Its also 
pretty resistant to decomposition [esp. compared to freebase form].
Obviously other forms could be easily made, but why bother?
<PRE>
> Will "Hardware store HCl" work?
</PRE>
Yes, in fact any aqeuous solution of HCl alone will work. Concentration
doesn't even really matter provided that pH is monitored - add the amount
needed to achieve the desired pH change.
<PRE>
> When your putting the jars in the fridge do you also put the lid on
> them or does it even matter?
</PRE>
Unless the reagents are attacked by drippingWeenieDogs it shouldn't
matter all that much. Best to place it safe and use lids anyways.
<PRE>
> What is "filler material"?
</PRE>
The other crap in any medicine tablet / pill / capsule that holds it 
together. Were your antibiotics to come without 'filler material', they
would also arrive in a little plastic baggie just like the illegal
drugs.
<PRE>
> If you want to make life easier for kitchen chemists, a "tablespoon" is
> about 15mL
</PRE>
Oh. Cool. Thanks. Nevertheless, a tablespoon is usually metalic, and
therefor probably not to cool to use with permaganate solution :) A plastic
one will doubtless work for the synthesis, but I am sure that it will become
discolored. Also, make sure not to pour the stuff into a tablespoon, as this
will doubtless upset the particules of solid KMnO4 on the bottom of the
concentrate, and end up giving you far to much KMnO4
