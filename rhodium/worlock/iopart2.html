<li>
Local Chemical supply houses.</li>

<li>
Mail order from chemical suppliers, if you have a business you can order
it. $60 /pound</li>

<li>
Feed and tack stores in rural areas. Horses get a hoof fungus called "thrush"
from hanging out in stalls which are wet.</li>

<li>
It is&nbsp; used in sheep dip. At the feed and tack you ask for "horse
hoof" or "Iodine"</li>

<li>
Purification of water, there is a Y2K product marketed at some pool suppliers
, and out Camping, Boating, Outdoors&nbsp; backpacking type places for
purifying drinking water the price is more expensive this way.</li>

<li>
They are required to take your ID information. and ask what it is to be
used for</li>

<li>
In many places you may buy up to 8 ounces /person/ 30 days</li>

<li>
It is important to find buyers, to keep your name off those ID lists</li>

<li>
Many people are willing to make the purchase for you if you give them a
little stash and perhaps a bit of cash. Just don't spoil them. The cost
is around $50 for 8 ounces.</li>

<br>I am fortunate regarding the I2 I live in Cow Country its no biggee
at all to buy it and lots of it.
<br>If I could throw something in to the mix here, when purchasing the
I2 from the feed/tackle store, ask the rep about it quite casually. "My
quarter horse has a big black rotten hole in its hoof, the vet/farrier
told me some iodine crystal packed in the thrush hole would burn it out.
How exactly do I apply it?" or something to the like. Reps have mundane
shitty jobs and a chance to impart some of their wisdom is always well
received.
<br>If you are walking in semi dumb up front chances are you won't be grilled
about intended purpose at all.
<br>The straight iodine poultice is considered out of date medicine, many
now go with bleach solutions because there are certain contraindications
that can be suffered by the animal due to iodine exposure.
<br>If the sales rep mentions this it will be important that you say the
vet said the thrush is so
<br>advanced if not treated right away and drastically the animal could
suffer lameness**
<br>Failing all of this like Worlock said in another thread.. mail order
$45/pound
<br>The shortest distance between two points is a straight line! (just
make sure a trusted friend is the second point of that line)

<br>Tincture of iodine is iodide salts in alcohol, it is found in supermarkets
in small one ounce bottles. Each bottle can generate a little over a gram
of&nbsp; I2 the price has shot up from 0 .60 cents to $1.80 / bottle. Tincture
comes in 2% or 7%.
<br>It is also available at feed and tack stores in pints and gallons.

<br><b><u><font size="+1">Potential problems</font></u></b> Not rinsing the
I2 enough with water to remove the chlorine and salts from the tincture
Not drying the I2 out enough and adding it too wet to your reaction. If
in doubt at all re-wash the iodine with distilled water in a filter and
wring out, The iodine is only very slightly soluble in water, you lose
very little washing with water. If it is not clean and dry you can lose
a lot more in a failed reaction.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font size="+1">The Solution</font></u></b>
<br>There are only three chemicals involved in the reaction, make sure
they are top notch and your OK
<br>1.&nbsp; Ephedrine - the free base reacts stronger&nbsp; than the HCl
salt
<br>2.&nbsp; Iodine&nbsp; - use more if you are not getting&nbsp; a reaction

<p><b>Cold Finge</b>r - used to sublimate iodine from a flask. Is the way
to purify your Iodine crystals.
<br>The theory is that as iodine is heated it skips from a solid to a gas
<br>when cooled it returns from the gas directly back to a solid.
<br>Several test tubes are used. When one becomes damp from moisture, it
can quickly be replaced,
<br>preventing&nbsp; water vapor from messing up your crystals.
<br>Acetone and dry ice are used for the real cold finger you may need
<center>
<p>This device using the flask and test tube is one method. A bowl and
a plate do not allow you to easily chill ,collect, deal with water condensation,
protect against iodine&nbsp; vapor escape, or add more iodine to be sublimated

<br>
<p>The Role of Phosphorus in Industry
<br>There are seemingly countless uses for phosphorus and phosphorus compounds
in industry. By far the most important of them is in the manufacture of
fertilizers, a practice which uses up over half of the phosphate rock consumed
in the U.S. About 15% of the phosphorus equivalent in phosphate rock utilized
in the U.S. is converted into elemental phosphorus, the majority of which
is used to produce phosphoric acid. In addition, some of this elemental
phosphorus is used for a variety of military applications as well as in
roach and rodent poisons. <b>Red phosphorus,</b> of course, is used to
produce wooden and paper safety matches, where it is applied to the <b>abrasive
surface upon which the safety match is scratched</b>. It is also used in
the manufacture of <b>fireworks.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Phosphates, especially polyphosphates, "are truly chemicals of universal
application." [11] They have been used in baking powder, carbonated beverages,
dental materials, dentifrice, detergents, fertilizers, fire resistant textiles,
laundering, metal surface treatment (rust proofing), milk and milk products
and water treatment, to name a few. 11 Phosphoric acid is used to flavor
soft drinks, to defecate and clarify sugar, to manufacture gelatin, and
to prevent spoiling in silage. It is also employed in the electropolishing
of stainless steel and aluminum, as well as in other metal treatment applications.
Finally, among other things, phosphoric acid has applications in the textile
industry, in glass manufacture, in the purification of hydrogen peroxide
and in a host of laboratory applications.

<p>It is not illegal, in all states but it is watched just like Iodine
and large amounts of ephedrine.
<br>Get some and you will always have some, not much gets used&nbsp; up,
it does become coated with organics
<br>you can clean those off easy. You can re-use it over and over again.
<p>No, you cannot get it out of picture tubes on TVs
<br>Yes, you can get it off match strikers
<br>Yes, you can get it from road flare strikers
<br>Yes you can walk into a Chem. supply house and buy 4 oz for $50
<br>Yes you can mail order it to your business for very much cheaper. $95
for 2 kilos
<br>Yes it is found in fireworks
<br>If you can get over this hurdle your headin' for the finish line.
<br>Ask, beg, or buy the information on where to get it for it from anyone
you can, you will get some.
<br>It is out there, others do it so can you. Keep after it, eventually
someone will tell you where to get it.
<br>Amorphous Red Phosphorus 99.5% pure,
<br>Help out a dealer, ask him to ask the cook where to get it. No one
wants to tell, it is a secret.,
<br>I once had someone walk into a Lab supplier and buy 4 oz. Now some
people bring me kilos every now and then

<br><b><u><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">Cleaning Red Phosphorous</font></font></u></b>
<br>This is a proven,&nbsp; no BS procedure for cleaning up RP. This is
not the procedure used to get the RP off of match strikers.
<br>The use of Sulfuric acid and/or Hydrochloric acid&nbsp; is recommended
only in severe cases if nothing else will work.
<br>What happens to the RP,?&nbsp; Some gets oxidized in the reaction and
is gone. Most will get a waxy build up after a few uses,
<br>It gets course and grainy because the powdery stuff,&nbsp; is what
reacts the best,&nbsp; large surface area for a small volume.
<p><b><u>Screen</u></b>
<br>Run it through a fine stainless steel&nbsp; screen, (kitchen utensil
- grocery store) to remove debris, and breakup chunks
<br><b><u>Acetone</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;put the RP in a funnel with coffee&nbsp; filter&nbsp;&nbsp; pour
acetone through it until the acetone is a light yellow
<p><b><u>Solvents</u></b>
<br>Any of the following familiar solvents have been safely used to wash
the RP
<br>methanol, ethanol, denatured alcohol , isopropynol, toluene , xylene
<br>Rinse with acetone again to remove non-polar solvents
<p><b><u>Water</u></b>
<br>Final Washes&nbsp; with warm or hot distilled water
<p><b><u>Sulfuric acid wash&nbsp; (rarely needed)</u></b>
<br>If the RP still has an abnormal&nbsp; coating
<br>Soak in warm dilute H2SO4 10 minutes
<br>Add equal amount of HCl for 10 minutes
<br>let settle
<br>pour off the acid
<br>repeat until clean
<br>repeat the Acetone and water washes
<br><b><u>Dry it</u></b>
<br>An oven at 150 F&nbsp; to 200 F just barely on,
<br>I have had the glass bowl break while baking&nbsp; 1/4 pound of RP
in the oven , the RP was fortunately still wet , it started to smolder
about 15 minutes later&nbsp; the house was full of smoke.
<br>Threw the towel on it , that slowed it down, pumped two large&nbsp;
fire extinguishers into it with no effect , secured the garden hose and
with wet towel finally put it out, began the clean up and there was still
areas on fire, the extinguishers ruined the RP and made a nasty mess
<br><b><u>Screen and powder</u></b>
<br>Usually screening it will be is enough ,
<br>Powder with mortar and pestle
