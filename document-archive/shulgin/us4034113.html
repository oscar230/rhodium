<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>There is provided according to the present invention a pharmaceutical
     composition useful for restoring the performance of mammals which
     comprises an effective amount of a compound of the formula
     ##STR2##
     wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are alike or different and each is
     (lower)alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof and a
     pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
<BR><BR>Another aspect of this invention is the provision of a method of restoring
     the performance of mammals, including man, which comprises administering
     to said mammal an effective amount, of a compound of formula I or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.
<BR><BR>A further aspect of this invention is the provision of a method of treating
     despondent, asocial, depressed, anxious and senile geriatric humans
     suffering from chronic organic brain disease and parkinsonism, which
     comprises administering to said humans an effective amount of a compound
     of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof. The
     treatment of patients suffering the above-described symptoms results in
     the patients exhibiting near-normal behavior patterns.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I contain an asymmetric carbon atoms and thus
     normally occur as a racemic mixture of the dextro- and levorotatory
     optical isomers. Both the dextro- and levorotatory isomers of these
     compounds, as well as the racemic mixtures are useful in the composition
     and method described above and are considered to be an integral part of
     the invention.
<BR><BR>A further aspect of this invention is the provision of the dextro- and
     levorotatory isomers of the compounds of formula I; and the
     pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts thereof.
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts include the organic and
     inorganic acid addition salts, e.g., those prepared from acids such as
     hydrochloric, sulfuric, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, hydriodic,
     glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic and the like. Such
     salts are prepared by conventional methods by reacting the free base with
     the desired acid on about an equivalent basis.
<BR><BR>The term "(lower)alkyl" as used herein includes both straight chain and
     branched chain alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g.,
     methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl.
<BR><BR>A preferred embodiment of the instant invention is the compound having the
     formula
     ##STR3##
     or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.
<BR><BR>A more preferred embodiment is the essentially pure dextrorotatory and
     levorotatory isomer of the compound having formula II supra.
<BR><BR>The most preferred embodiment is the levorotatory isomer of compound II
     supra.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I are prepared as exemplified below by reducing a
     2-nitro-1-(2,5-(lower)alkoxy- 4-(lower)alkylphenyl)butene-1 of the formula
     ##STR4##
     wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are as described above, with, for
     example, lithium aluminum hydride in the presence of a nonreactive solvent
     medium. Suitable solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran,
     diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and the like. The reaction proceeds at
     temperatures from about 0.degree. C. to 150.degree. C. Preferably the
     reaction is carried out at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture
     and under reflux and about 2 moles of lithium aluminum hydride per mole of
     butene are used. The preferred solvent is ether.
<BR><BR>The general procedures for the preparation of the compounds of this
     invention and the starting materials are described in U.S. Pat. No.
     3,547,999.
<BR><BR>The racemic compounds of formula I may be resolved by forming a mixture of
     the two diastereoisomeric salts of said compounds with a dextrorotatory
     ring-substituted tartranilic acid, e.g., nitro, chloro or bromo
     substituted, separating and diastereoisomeric salts by fractional
     crystallization and converting the separated diastereoisomeric salts to
     the respective optical isomers of the compound preferably by treatment
     with a strong base, e.g. sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the
     like. (+)-2'-Nitrotartranilic acid and (+)-2'-chlorotartranilic acid are
     particularly useful in the resolution of the racemic compounds of Formula
     I. The general resolution procedure using tartranilic acids is described
     in U.S. Pat. No. 3,452,086 and by T. A. Montzka et al, J. Org. Chem. 33,
     3993 (1968).
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I in the form of racemic mixtures or their
     dextrorotatory or levorotatory isomers possess performance restoring
     activity making them useful for enhancing the performance ability of
     mammals. The compounds while structurally related to amphetamine do not
     produce hypertension, tachycardia, anorexia, insomnia and post drug
     dysphoria which are common with amphetamine.
<BR><BR>The performance restoration activity of the compounds of this invention was
     determined by the shuttle box acute acquisition, pole climb acute
     acquisition and pole climb chronic avoidance acquisition tests.
<BR><BR>Shuttle Box-- Acute Acquisition
<BR><BR>Male hooded rats (500-700 gm.) were used as experimental subjects. The
     compounds are administered either subcutaneously or orally 30 minutes
     prior to shuttle box test. (shuttle box-- manufactured by Lehigh Valley
     Electronics Co.). Each trial is 60 seconds long consisting of a 5 second
     avoidance period, during which the animal is required to move to the other
     side of shuttle box to avoid shock, and a 5 second shock period, if the
     animal fails to move during the avoidance period. During these 10 seconds,
     the cue light is lit on the other side of the test box but turned off if
     the animal moves to the other side of the box. The rat is given a maximum
     of 100 trials or until it acquires the ability to avoid 8 shocks out of 10
     consecutive trials. Its score is the number of the trial which is the last
     trial prior to avoiding 8 shocks out of 10.
<BR><BR>Pole Climb--Acute Acquisition
<BR><BR>Male hooded rats (200- 300 gms.) were used as experimental subjects. The
     compounds are administered subcutaneously 30 minutes prior to placement of
     the animal into the pole climb chamber (Cook, L., and Weidly, E. (1957),
     Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 66, p. 740). Each trial is 60 seconds long
     consisting of a 5 second avoidance period, during which a sound is sounded
     and the animal has to jump up onto the pole and a 5 second shock period if
     the animal fails to jump. During the avoidance and shock periods the tone
     and electric shock are turned off if the animal jumps onto the pole. The
     animal is given a maximum of 100 trials or until it acquires the ability
     to avoid 8 shocks out of 10 consecutive trials. Its score is the number of
     the trial which is the last trial prior to attaining avoidance of 8 of 10
     consecutive trials.
<BR><BR>Pole Climb--Chronic Avoidance Acquisition
<BR><BR>A similar procedure was used as in the pole climb-acute acquisition
     procedure described above but each animal was given 20 trials every day
     and the number of avoidances was determined. With each day there was an
     improvement in the performance; the number of avoidance responses
     increased.
<BR><BR>When (.+-.)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride
     and the dextrorotatory and levorotatory isomers were tested according to
     the foregoing procedures, the following results were obtained.

<BR><BR>The above test results disclose that the racemic mixture,
     (.+-.)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride, and
     the dextrorotatory and levorotatory isomers exhibit learning enhancing
     activity, the levorotatory isomer appeared to exhibit greater activity
     than the dextrorotatory isomer. No increase in locomotion activity was
     observed after administration of the racemic mixture or either of the
     isomers.
<BR><BR>The ability of (-)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane
     hydrochloride (BL-3912A) to restore performance in humans have been
     confirmed in the initial clinical trials.
<BR><BR>(-)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride has
     demonstrated remarkable and profound effects in initial clinical studies
     in senile geriatric patients. For example, in geriatric nursing home
     patients that were dull and presented varying degrees of inactivity and
     withdrawal, a dose of 100-300 mg. per day produced remarkable results.
     Mood and behavior improved and patients became more alert, active and less
     disabled.
<BR><BR>At similar doses a reduction in rigidity and tremor occurred in patients
     suffering from moderate to severe Parkinsonism. During BL-3912A therapy,
     handwriting, speech and feeding habits dramatically improved.
<BR><BR>In one study involving 14 nursing home patients, improvement progressed to
     the point where the investigator felt some patients were well enough to
     return home.
<BR><BR>The response to a particular dose level of the compound is variable and
     peculiar to each patient. In general, the patient should be titrated to
     his own needs.
<BR><BR>In clinical trials BL-3912A did not produce hypertension, tachycardia,
     anorexia, insomnia and post drug dysphoria which are commonly seen
     following administration of amphetamine and other stimulants commonly used
     to restore performance, e.g., Ritalin.RTM. and pemoline.
<BR><BR>BL-3912A is devoid of hallucinogenic activity in mammals, including man and
     has been found to antagonize the effects of
     2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine (DOM) in rodents and cats. DOM is a
     hallucinogenic agent widely subjected to abuse by thrill-seeking youth and
     others.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I may be administered as the free bases or in the
     form of their nontoxic addition salts. They may be compounded and
     formulated into pharmaceutical preparations in unit dosage form for oral
     or parenteral administration with organic or inorganic solid materials or
     liquids which are pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Some examples of
     the carriers which can be used are gelatin capsules, sugars, cellulose
     derivatives such as carboxymethyl-cellulose, gelatin, talc, magnesium
     stearate, vegetable oil such as peanut oil, etc., liquid petroleum,
     glycerin, sorbitol, ethanol, agar, elixirs, syrups and water including
     sterile water. The composition may take the form of tablets, powders,
     granules, capsules, suspensions, solutions and the like.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I when administered orally or parenterally in an
     effective amount restore performance in mammals. An oral dosage range of
     about 1 to about 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight is a convenient
     dosage for producing these effects in mammals. However, in general, the
     particular dosage most suitable for a particular application, as might be
     expected, will vary with the age, weight and general health of the mammal
     under treatment and the degree of performance improvment present. After
     taking into consideration these factors and any other factors to be
     considered, one skilled in the art of treating diseases of mammals can
     readily determine the appropriate dosage.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I are administered orally or parenterally in the
     treatment of geriatric patients suffering from senility or parkinsonism in
     dosages of 25 to 100 mg. one to four times a day depending upon the effect
     desired. However, in general, the particular dosage most suitable for a
     particular application, as might be expected, will vary with the age,
     weight and general health of the human under treatment. One skilled in the
     art of treating human diseases can readily determine the appropriate dose
     for the respective patient.
<BR><BR>The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention described
     herein without unduly restricting it.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Preparation of 2,5-Dimethoxytoluene
     ##STR5##
<BR><BR>To a solution of 50 g. potassium hydroxide in methanol is added 50 g. of
     toluhydroquinone. The resulting solution is heated on a steam bath, and an
     excess of methyl iodide (75 ml.) is added through an effective reflux
     condenser. The addition is continued over several hours, and the resulting
     combination heated at reflux for several additional hours. At this time,
     the reaction mixture is brought to room temperature, acidified with
     hydrochloric acid, and exhaustively extracted with methylene chloride.
<BR><BR>The organic phase of the above-extraction is washed with 5% sodium
     hydroxide solution (to remove all phenolic byproducts), then with water.
     The solvent remaining is concentrated by evaporation, yielding a residual
     neutral oil (36.9 g.). This upon distillation yielded 2,5-dimethoxytoluene
     as a pale amber liquid (b.p. 105.degree.-111.degree. C. at 20 mm/Hg. The
     base washes yield, after acifification and extraction, 14.1 g. of a
     mixture of the two possible monomethylated derivatives which can be
     recycled in a subsequent repetition of the methylation step.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
     ##STR6##
<BR><BR>A solution of 40 ml. phosphorous oxychloride (POCl.sub.3) and 45 ml. of
     N-methylformanilide is allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 50
     minutes. There is then added 15.2 g. of 2,5-dimethoxytoluene and the
     resulting solution is heated on the steam bath for 140 minutes. The
     extremely dark viscous reaction mixture is added to 2 liters of water, and
     allowed to stir for several hours to complete the hydrolysis of the
     reaction intermediates. The solid product is removed by filtration, and
     after washing with water and air-drying yields 16.6 g of reddish crumbly
     crystals. This solid product is extracted with 2.times.125 ml. of boiling
     hexane, which on cooling deposits 12.1 g. of pale cream-colored crystals.
     Recrystallization from boiling hexane, yields a brilliant white product
     2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>Preparation of 2-Nitro-1-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylphenyl)-Butene-1
     ##STR7##
<BR><BR>A mixture of 31.6 g. of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde 20.2 ml. of
     nitropropane, 6 ml. cyclohexylamine, and 50 ml. benzene is kept at reflux
     in a Dean Stark apparatus for 24 hours. Cooling results in the spontaneous
     crystallization of an orange product, which on filtration and drying
     weighs 14.9 g. Recrystallization from methanol yields the product
     2-nitro-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-butene-1 as an orange
     crystalline material, mp. 115.degree. C.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>Preparation of (.+-.)-2-Amino-1-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylphenyl)Butane
     ##STR8##
<BR><BR>A suspension of 16 g. lithium aluminum hydride in 750 ml. anhydrous ether
     is brought to reflux, and through a Soxhlet thimble, 19.2 g. of
     2-nitro-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butene-1 is added. The reflux is
     maintained for 24 hours, then the reaction mixture is cooled externally
     with ice, and 500 ml. of a 20% solution of sulfuric acid is added
     cautiously. The two phase result is separated, and the aqueous fraction
     washed with ether. To this fraction is added 400 g. potassium sodium
     tartrate and the pH adjusted with aqueous sodium hydroxide until greater
     than 9. The product is extracted with methylene chloride, which when
     removed leaves a clear, colorless oil, (.+-.
     )-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl-butane. This is dissolved in
     ether, and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. The crystalline
     hydrochloride of (.+-.)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-butane
     thus obtained, after filtration and washing with additional anhydrous
     ether, weighed 12.0 g.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 5
<BR><BR>When in the procedure of Example 4,
     2-nitro-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-butene-1is replaced by an equal
     molar amount of
<BR><BR>2-nitro-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)-butene-1,

<BR><BR>A. (+)-2-Amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride.
<BR><BR>(.+-.)-2-Amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane (17.9 g., 80.2
     mmoles) and 10.82 g. (40.1 mmoles) of (+)-2'-nitrotartranilic acid were
     dissolved in 85 ml. of hot 95% ethanol. The solution was cooled, seeded
     with salt previously obtained on a test tube scale, and allowed to stand
     undisturbed at room temperature (20.degree.-25.degree. C.) until
     crystallization was complete (at least 18 hours). The solid was filtered,
     sucked as free of mother liquid as possible, and washed with 10 ml. of
     cold (-15.degree. C.) 95% ethanol in two portions. The mother liquor and
     washings were reserved for recovery of the (-)-isomer. The product was
     air-dried to give 12.32 g. of the pure (+)-2'-nitrotartranilic salt of
     (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane, mp.

<BR><BR>This salt was dissolved in 100 ml. of hot ethanol. The solution was cooled
     and poured into excess dilute potassium carbonate solution. The mixture
     was extracted with two portions of ether; the combined ether extracts were
     washed with dilute potassium carbonate solution, dilute sodium bicarbonate
     solution, and three portions of water. Drying and evaporation of the
     solvent gave 3.8 g. of pure
     (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane as a light yellow oil
     which crystallized upon standing, [.alpha.].sub.365.sup.26 + 155.3.degree.
     (c 1.273, 95% ethanol). The salt was formed with HCl gas in anhydrous
     ether. The solid was filtered, washed with ether and air-dried to give
     4.34 g. of slightly yellowish powder. Recrystallization from 105 ml. of
     2-propanol provided 3.70 g. of pure
