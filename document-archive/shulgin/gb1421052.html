D. H. Effron,  Raven Press 1970 and Shulgin, A. T., Sargen, T. and Naranjo,<BR>C.: and Structure-Activity Relationships of One-Ring  Psychotomimetics, Natere,  221537 (1969). These prior an  references disclose compounds closely related to the compounds of the present invention. However, none of the compounds is disclosed as having the activity of the compounds of the present invention.The Shulgin article in Psychoto- mimetic Drugs at pages 35-36  indicates that a "four-chain  compound" had been synt  thesized; however, the particular compound synthesized is not named, the structure is not disclosed, the method of preparation is not disclosed and no utility is disclosed in the article.<BR><BR> Accordingly the present invention provides a compound  of the general formula<BR>     <BR> wherein R1 is a (lower)alkyl,  cyclopropyl, or cyclopropylmethyl group and R2 and R  each represent a (lower)alkyl  group.<BR><BR> TheF  present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful for enhancing<BR> the learning capacity of mammals which com<BR> prises an effective amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of a racemic compound of the formula<BR>     <BR> wherein Rl  is a (lower)alkyI,  cyclopropyl or cyclopropyl-methyl group and R2 and R  each represent a (lower)alkyl  group, an optically active dextrorotatory  or levorotatory isomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<BR><BR> In another aspect the present invention provides a method of enhancing the learning capacity  of mammals which comprise admistering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or the dextrorotarory  or levorotatory isomer or pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.<BR><BR> The compounds of formula I contain an asymmetric carbon atom and thus normally occur as a racemic mixture of the dextro-  and levoratatory optical isomers. Both the dextroW  and levoratatory isomers of these compounds'  as well as the racemic mixtures may be used in the composition and method described above and are considered to be an integral part of the invention.<BR><BR> The present inventon includes within its  scope the dexoro-  and levorotatory isomers of the compounds of formula I; and the pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts thereof.<BR><BR> The pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts include the organic and inorganic acid addition salts, e.g. the hydrochloric, sulfuric, p-toluene  sulfonic, methane sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic and acetic acid salts. Such salts may be prepared by con ventional  methods by reacting the free base with the desired acid on about an equivalent basis.<BR><BR> By the term "(lonver)alkyl"  as used herein is meant both straight chain and branched chain alkyl groups containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. methyl, ethyl,  propyl, iso propyl, butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl.<BR><BR> The preferred embodiment of the present invention consists of the dexb  and levo-  rotatory isomers of the compound of the formula<BR>     <BR> and the pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts thereof. The most preferred embodiment is the levorotatory isomer of formula II.<BR><BR> Another preferred embodiment is. the compound of formula I wherein R1 is ethyl and R2 and R3 are each methyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.<BR><BR> Still another preferred embodiment is the compound  of formula I wherein R1 is methyl and R1 and Rs  are each ethyl, or a pilarma-  ceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.<BR><BR> The compounds of formula I are prepared as exemplified below by reducing a 2-nitro-1-  (2,5 - (lower)alkoxy  - 4 - (lower)aIkyl-  phenyl)-butene 1 of the formula <BR>     <BR> wherein R1, R2 and Ra  are as described above, with, for example, lithium aluminum hydride in the presence of a ncnftactive  solvent medium. Suitable solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuf,  diethylene glycol, dimethyl ether and the like.The reaction pro-  ceeds at temperatures from about 0 C. to 1500 C. Preferably the reaction is carried out at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture and under reflux and about 2 moles of lithium aluminum hydride per mole of butene are used. The preferred solvent is ether.<BR><BR> The general  procedures for the preparation  of tbe  compounds of this invention and the starting materials are described in U.S. Patent<BR>No. 3,547,999.<BR><BR> The racemic compounds of formula I may be resolved by forming a mixture  of the two diastereoisomeric  salts of said compounds  with a detttrorotatory  ring-substituted tarunilic  acid, e.g.,  nitro, chloro or bromo substituted,  separating said diastereoisomeric  salts by fractional crystallization and converting the separated diastereoisomeric salts to the respect tive optical isomers of the compound, prefer-  ably by treatment with a strong base, e.g. <BR><BR>sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the like. (+) -2'-Nitrotartranilic  acid and (+)2'-chlorotartranilic acid are particularly use  ful in the resolution of the racemic compounds of Formula I. The general resolution procedure using tartranilic acids is described in U.S.<BR><BR>3,452,086 and by T. A. Montzka et al. J.<BR><BR>Org. Chem. 33, 3993 (1968).<BR><BR> The compounds of formula I in the form of racemic mixtures or their dextrorotatory  or levorotatory isomers possess learning  enhance ment  activity making them useful for enhancing the learning capacity of mammals. The compounds while stmcturally  related  to amphetamine do not produce amphetamine like central nervous system stimulant activity in mammals<BR> The learning enhancement  activity of the compounds of this invention was determined by the shuttle box acute acquisition, pole climb acute acquisition and pole climb chronic avoidance acquisition tests.<BR><BR>Shuttle Box-Acute  Acquisition<BR> Male hooded rats (500--700 gm.) were used as experiental  subjects. The compounds are administered either subcutaneously  or orally 30 minutes prior to shuttle box test.<BR><BR>(shuttle box-manufactured  by Lehigh Valley<BR>Electronics Co.). Each trial is 60 seconds long consisting of a 5 second avoidance period, during which the animal is required to move to the other side of shuttle box to avoid shock, and a 5 second shock period, if the animal fails to move during  the avoidance period. During these 10 seconds the cue light is lit on the other side of the test box but turned off if the animal moves to the other side of the box. The rat is given a maximum of 100 trials or until it acquires the ability to avoid 8 shocks out of 10 consecutive trials. Its score is the number of the trial which is the last trial prior to avoiding 8 shocks out of 10.<BR><BR> Pole aimbAcute  Acquisition- <BR> Male hooded rats (200--300  gms.) were used as experimental subjects. The compounds are administered subcutaneously  30 minutes prior to placement of the animal into the pole climb chamber (Cook, L, and Weidley, E.<BR><BR>(1957), Ann. N.Y. Sci., 66, p. 740). Each  trial is 60 seconds long consisting of a 5 second avoidance period, during which a sound is sounded and the animal has to jump up onto the pole and a 5 second shock period if the  animal fails to jump. During the avoidance and shock periods the tone and electric shock are turned off if the animal jumps onto the pole.<BR><BR>The animal is given a maximum of 100 trials or until it acquires the ability to avoid 8 shocks out of 10 consecutive trials. Its score is the number of the trial which is the last trial prior to attaining avoidance of 8 to 10 con; secutive  trials.<BR><BR>Pole Clim--Chronic  Avoidance  Acquisition-- <BR> A similar procedure was used as in the pole climb-acute acquisition procedure described above but each animal was given 20 trials every day and the number of avoidances was determined. With each day there was an im provement  in the performance; the number of avoidance responses increased.<BR><BR>  When (+) - 2 --amino - 1- (2,5-dimeth-  oxy - 4 - methylphenyl)butane  hydrochloride and the dextrorotatory and levorotatory isomers were tested according to the foregoing procedures the following results were obtained.<BR><BR> TABLE 1<BR> Acute Avoidance Acquisition by Breeder Rats in the Shuttle Box<BR> No. Trials required to<BR> Compound Dose (mg/kg) No. of Animals reach 80% Avoidance (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5- 1 sc 8 57 dimethoxy-4-methyl- 5 sc 10 58 phenyl)butane hydro- 10 sc 10 47 chloride 10 po 9 58 (-)-2-amino-1-(2,5- 1 Sc  9 65 dimethoxy-4-methyl- 5 sc 10 43 phenyl)butane hydro- 10 sc 9 39 chloride 10 po 7 66 (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5- 1 sc 6 67 dimethoxy-4-methyl- 10 sc 8 37 phenyl)butane hydrochloride<BR>Saline 20 85<BR> TABLE 2<BR> Acute Avoidance Acquisition by Adult Rat in the Pole Climb<BR> No.Trials required to<BR> Compound Dose (mg/kg sc) No. of Animals reach 80% Avoidance (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5-  10 10 85 dimethoxy4-methyl-  phenyl)butane hydrochloride (-)-2-amino-1-(2,5- 10 10 65 dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride<BR>Saline 10 100  <BR> TABLE 3<BR> Chronic Avoidance Acquisition by Adult Rats in the Pole Climb<BR> (12 Rats Used) No.Avoidances/240 Trials<BR> (+)-2-amino-1-(2,5-di-  (-)-2-amino-1-(2,5-di  methoxy-4methyl-phenyl)- methoxy-4-methyl-phenyl)- <BR>Treatment Day butane hydrochloride butane hydrochloride Saline<BR> 5 mg/kg sc 5 mg/kg sc<BR> -1 17/240 18/240 20/240<BR> 1 56/240 63/240 51/240<BR> 2 76/240 85/240 63/240<BR> 3 91/240 108/240 77/240<BR> 4 103/240 101/240 94/240<BR> The above test results disclose that the racemic mixture (+)  - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5dimethoxy - 4 - methylphenyl)butane hydro-  chloride, and the dextrorotatory and levo  rotatory isomers exhibit learning enhancing activity, the levorotatory isomer appeared to exhibit greater activity than the dextro  rotatory isomer.No increase in locomotion  activity was observed after administration of the racemic mixture or either of the isomers.<BR><BR> The compounds of formula I may be administer as the free bases or in the form  of their nontoxic addition salts. They may be compounded and formulated into pharmaceutical preparations in unit dosage form for oral or parenteral administration with organic or irrorganic solid materials or liquids which are pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Some examples of the carriers which can be used are gelatin capsules, sugars, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethykellulose,  gelatin; talc, magnesium stearate, vegetable oil such as peanut oil, etc., liquid petroleum, glycerin, sore bitol, ethanol, agar, elixirs, syrups and water including sterile water. The composition may take the form of tablets, powders, granules, capsules, suspensions, solutions and the like.<BR><BR> The compounds of formula I when administered orally or parenterally in an effective amount produce learning enhancement  in mammals. An oral dosage range of about 0.1 to about 0.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight is a convenient dosage for producing learning  enhancement in mammals. However, in general, the particular dosage most suitable for a particular application, as might be expec ted, wi  vary with the age, weight and general health of the mammal under treatment and the degree of learning enhancement required. After talking into consideration  these factors and any other factors to be considered, one skilled in the art of treating diseases of mammals can readily determine  the appropriate  dosage.<BR><BR> The following examples afe  intended to<BR>Illustrate the invention described herein with  nut unduly restricting it. Examples 1 to 3 relate to the preparation of intermediate derivatives.<BR><BR> Example 1.<BR><BR> Preparation of 2,5-Dimethoxytoluene<BR>     <BR><BR> To a solution of 50 g. potassium hydroxide in methanol is added to 50 g. of toluhydroquinone. The resulting solution is heated on a steam bath, and an excess of methyl iodide (75 mL) is added through an effective reflux conderser. The addition is continued over several hours, and the resulting combination heated at reflux for several additional hours. At this time, the reaction mixture is brought to room tem erature,  acidified with hydrochloric acid, and exhaustively extracted with methylene chloride.<BR><BR> The organic phase of the above extraction  is washed with 5%  sodium hydroxide solution (to remove all phenolic byproducts), then with water. The solvent remaining is concentrated by evaporation, yielding a residual neutral oil (36.9 g.). This upon distillation yielded 2,5dimethoxytoluene as a pale amber liquid (b.p.<BR><BR> 105-1110C  X  20 mm/Hg). The base washes yield, after acidification and extraction, 14.1 gv  of a mixture of the two possible   monomethylated  derivatives which can be recycled in a subsequent repetition of the methylation step.<BR><BR> Example 2.<BR>     <BR><BR><BR> A solution of 40 ml. phosphorus oxychioride  (POCl3) and 45 ml. of N-methylformanilide is allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 50 minutes. There is then added 15.2 g. of 2,5-dimethoxytoluene and the resulting solution is heated on the steam bath for 140 minutes. The extremely dark viscous reaction mixture is added to 2 liters of water, and allowed to stir for several hours to complete the hydro  lysis of the reaction intermediates. The solid product is removed by filtration, and after washing with water and air-drying yields of 16.6 g. of reddish crumbly crystals. This solid product is extracted with 2 X 125 ml. of boiling hexane, which on cooling deposits 12.1 g.<BR><BR>of pale cream-coloured crystals. Recrystallization from boiling hexane,  yields a brilliant white product, 2,5-dimethoxy4-methylbenz  aldehyde.<BR><BR> Example 3.<BR><BR> Preparation of 2-Nitro-1-(2,5-Dimeioxy-   4-Methylphenyl)-Butene 1 <BR>     <BR><BR> A mixture of 31.6 g. of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-  methylbenzaldehyde, 20.2 ml. of nitroprepane,  6 ml. cyclohexylamine,  and 50 ml. benzene is kept at reflux in a Dean Stark apparatus for 24 hours. Cooling results in the spontaneous crystallization of an orange product, which on filtration and drying weighs 14.9 g.<BR><BR>Recrystallization from methanol yields the product 2 - nitro - (2,5 - dimethoxy  - 4methylphenyl)-butene-1 as an orange crystalline material, mp. 115 C. <BR><BR> Example 4.<BR><BR> Preparation of (+)-2-Amino-1-(2,5-Di- <BR> methoxy-4-Methylphenyl)  Butane<BR>     <BR><BR> A suspension of 16 g. lithium aluminum hydride in 750 ml. anhydrous ether is brought to reflux, and through a Soxhlet  thimble, 19.2 g. of 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4methylphenyl)-butene-1 is added. The reflux<BR> is maintained for 24 hours, then the reaction<BR> mixture is cooled externally with ice, and 500<BR> ml. of a 20% solution of sulfuric acid is added<BR> cautiously. The two phase result is separated,<BR> and the aqueous fraction washed with ether.<BR><BR> To this fraction is added 400 g. potassium<BR> sodium tartrate and the pH adjusted with<BR> aqueous sodium hydroxide until greater than<BR> 9. The product is extracted with methylene<BR> chloride, which when removed leaves a clear,<BR> colorless oil, (+)  - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5<BR> dimethoxy - 4 - methylphenyl) butane. This<BR> is dissolved in ether, and saturated with an<BR> hydrous hydrogen chloride. The crystalline<BR> hydrochloride of (+)  - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5<BR> dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)  butane thus oh <BR> obtained,  after filtration and washing with addi<BR> tional anhydrous ether, weighed 12.0 g.<BR><BR> Example 5.<BR><BR> When in the procedure of Example 4, 2nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - methyl phenyl)-butene-l  is replaced by an equal molar amount of 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl<BR> phenyl) -butene-1,  2- nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy -4- propyl- <BR> phenyl)-butene-l,<BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - iso  propyiphenyl) -butene- 1, <BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 -  dimethoxy - 4 - butyl<BR> phenyl ) -butene- 1,<BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 diethoxy - 4 - methyl  phenyl)-butene-1,~~ <BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dipropoxy - 4 - methyl  phenyl)-butene-l, <BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - diisopropoxy - 4 methyl   phenyl)-butene-1, <BR> 2 - nitro - 1 -(2,5 -  dibutoxy - 4 - methyl    phenyl)-butene-l, <BR> 2 - nitro - 1 - (2 -  methoxy - 5 - ethoxy - 4  methylphenyl)-butene-l,<BR> 2- nitro - 1- (2- ethoxy -5- methoxy -4-<BR> methylphenyl ) -butene- 1,  2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5  diethoxy - 4 - ethyl<BR> phenyl)-butene-1,  and 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - diethoxy - 4 - propyl<BR> phenyl ) -butene- 1, 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - cycl <BR> propylmethylphenyl)-butene-1, and 2 - nitro - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4 - cyclo-   propylphenyl) -butene- 1  there are obtained<BR> () - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 -  dimethoxy - 4<BR> ethylphenyl) -butane,  (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 - dimethoxy - 4-<BR> propylphenyl)-butane,    () - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5  - dimethoxy - 4<BR> isopropylphenyl)-butane, (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5  - dimethoxy - 4  butylphenyl) -butane, <BR> (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5  - diethoxy - 4<BR> methylphenyl ) -butane, () -2- amino - 1 -  (2,5 - dipropoxy   methylphenyl) -butane, (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 - diisopropoxy- <BR> 4-methylphenyl) -butane, () -2- amino - 1 - (2,5 -  dibutoxy <BR> methylphenyl)  -butane, (+) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2 - methoxy - 5-<BR> ethoxy-4-methylphenyl ) -butane, <BR> (+) -  2 - amino - 1 - (2 - ethoxy  - 5<BR> methoxy-4-methylphenyl ) -butane, (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 - diethoxy -4-<BR> ethylphenyl ) -butane, <BR> (#) - 2 - amino- 1 - (2,5 -  diethoxy - 4<BR> propylphenyl) -butane<BR> (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 -  dimethoxy - 4 -  cyclopropylmethylphenyl) -butane, <BR> (#) - 2 - amino - 1 - (2,5 -  dimethoxy - 4<BR> cyclopropylphenyl)-butane  respectively.<BR><BR> Resolution of 2 - Amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-<BR> methylphenyl)butane.<BR><BR> Example 6.<BR><BR>A.
