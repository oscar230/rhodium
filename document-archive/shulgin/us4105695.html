<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>This invention relates to novel compounds which are useful for enhancing
     the learning capacity of mammals, including man, and they have been found
     to have a profound beneficial effect in human geriatric patients by
     increasing their mental alertness and improving their mental attitude and
     physical appearance without the undesirable stimulant side effects
     commonly associated with amphetamines.
<BR><BR>In another aspect, this invention relates to a method of preparing the
     novel compounds. In still another aspect, this invention relates to a
     method of enhancing the learning capacity of mammals. In a further aspect,
     this invention relates to compositions useful in the method of enhancing
     the learning capacity of mammals.
<BR><BR>2. Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR>Numerous compounds structurally related to amphetamine
     (.alpha.-methylphenethylamine) have been prepared and reported in the
     literature and are the subject matter of various patents. Of particular
     interest with respect to the compounds disclosed herein are U.S. Pat. No.
     3,547,999, Shulgin, A. T.: Chemistry and Structure-Activity Relationships
     of the Psychotomimetics which appeared in the book, Psychotomimetic Drugs,
     Ed. D. H. Efron, Raven Press 1970 and Shulgin, A. T., Sargent, T. and
     Naranjo, C.: Structure-Activity Relationships of One-Ring
     Psychotomimetics, Nature, 521-537 (1969). The foregoing patent and
     references disclose compounds closely related to the compounds of this
     invention. However, none of the compounds is disclosed as having the
     activity of the compounds of this invention. The Shulgin article in
     Psychotomimetic Drugs at pages 35-36 indicates that a "four chain
     compound" had been synthesized; however, the particular compound
     synthesized is not named, the structure is not disclosed, the method of
     preparation is not disclosed and no utility is disclosed in the article.

<BR><BR>Belgian Pat. No. 806,990 describes and claims the compounds having the
     formula
     ##STR3##
     wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are alike or different and each is
     (lower)alkyl. The patent describes a method of preparation that is
     non-stereospecific.
<BR><BR>D. E. Nichols, C. F. Barfkneckt and D. B. Rusterholz describe the
     "Asymmetric Synthesis of Psychotomimetic Phenylisopropylamines" in the
     Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1973, Vol. 16, No. 5, 480-483.
<BR><BR>C. F. Barfknecht and D. E. Nichols, in J. Medicinal Chemistry, 14, 370-2
     (1971), disclose inter alia the compound of the formula
     ##STR4##
     which is the lower homolog of one of the compounds claimed herein.
     However, unlike the compounds of the present invention, that compound was
     disclosed as having mescaline-like side-effects which are much more
     profound than those produced by DOM.
<BR><BR>Chemical Abstracts, 81, 104988s (1974) (corresponding to West German OLS
     No. 2,355,350) discloses the compound of the formula
     ##STR5##
     as the racemate and the optically active antipodes. The compound improved
     the chronic avoidance aquisition of rats.
<BR><BR>U.S. Pat. No. 3,457,354 discloses compounds of the formula
     ##STR6##
     in which X is --OH or --NH.sub.2 and R is H, --CH.sub.3 or --C.sub.2
     H.sub.5 as antihypertensive agents.
<BR><BR>U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,737 discloses compounds of the formula
     ##STR7##
     in which R.sup.1 is --CH.sub.3, --C.sub.2 H.sub.5 or --C.sub.3 H.sub.7 and
     R.sup.2 (in position 2, 4, 5 or 6) is F, Cl, Br, --CH.sub.3, --C.sub.2
     H.sub.5 or --C.sub.3 H.sub.7 as antihypertensive and antidepressant
     agents.
<BR><BR>A. T. Shulgin, in Experientia, 19, 127-8 (1963), reports the testing of a
     series of mescaline homologs of the formula
     ##STR8##
     in which R varied from H through C.sub.7 H.sub.15. He reports that
     toxicity and behavioral studies with mice could not distinguish between
     the first three members of this series (i.e. the ethylamino, propylamino
     and butylamino compounds). In humans it is established that the compound
     in which R is CH.sub.3 (the propylamino compound) is more than twice as
     potent as mescaline (R = H; the ethylamino compound), but Shulgin found
     that the compound in which R = C.sub.2 H.sub.5 (the butylamino compound)
     produced neither central nervous system activity nor psychtotomimetic
     (hallucinogenic) disturbance. Surprisingly, the compounds of the present
     invention have been found to possess the desirable central nervous system
     activity (e.g. enhancement of learning capacity and improvement of mental
     alertness) without the undesirable psychotomimetic side-effects.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The compounds having the formula
     ##STR9##
     wherein R.sup.1 is Cl, Br, (lower)alkylthio or
     ##STR10##
     in which R.sup.3 is H or (lower)alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable
     non-toxic salt thereof have been found to enhance the learning capacity of
     mammals, including man, and to improve the mental alertness and attitudes
     of geriatrics without producing the undesirable stimulant side effects
     associated with the use of amphetamines.
<BR><BR>COMPLETE DISCLOSURE
<BR><BR>There is provided according to the present invention a pharmaceutical
     composition useful for enhancing the learning capacity of mammals which
     comprises an effective amount of a compound of the formula
     ##STR11##
     wherein R.sup.1 is Cl, Br, (lower)alkylthio or
     ##STR12##
     in which R.sup.3 is H or (lower)alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable
     nontoxic salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
<BR><BR>Another aspect of this invention is the provision of a method of enhancing
     the learning capacity of mammals, including man, which comprises
     administering to said mammal an effective amount, of a compound of formula
     I or a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.
<BR><BR>A further aspect of this invention is the provision of a method of treating
     despondent, psychotic, schizophrenic, manic depressive and senile
     geriatric humans, which comprises administering to said humans an
     effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically
     acceptable nontoxic salt thereof. The treatment of patients suffering the
     above-described symptoms results in the patients exhibiting near-normal
     behavior patterns.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I contain an asymmetric carbon atom and thus
     normally occur as a racemic mixture of the dextro- and levorotatory
     optical isomers. Both and dextro- and levorotatory isomers of these
     compounds, as well as the racemic mixtures are useful in the composition
     and method described above and are considered to be an integral part of
     the invention.
<BR><BR>A further aspect of this invention is the provision of the dextro- and
     levorotatory isomers of the compounds of formula I; and the
     pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts thereof.
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts include the organic and
     inorganic acid addition salts, e.g., those prepared from acids such as
     hydrochloric, sulfuric, sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic,
     hydriodic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic and the
     like. Such salts are prepared by conventional methods by reacting the free
     base with the desired acid on about an equivalent basis.
<BR><BR>The term "(lower)alkyl" as used herein includes both straight chain and
     branched chain alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g.,
     methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl.
<BR><BR>A preferred embodiment of the instant invention is the compound having the
     formula
     ##STR13##
     wherein R.sup.1 is Cl, Br, --SCH.sub.3 or --CH.sub.2 OH; or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salt thereof.
<BR><BR>A more preferred embodiment is the compound of formula I wherein R.sup.1 is
     Cl.
<BR><BR>Another more preferred embodiment is the compound of formula I wherein
     R.sup.1 is Br.
<BR><BR>Another more preferred embodiment is the compound of formula I wherein
     R.sup.1 is --SCH.sub.3.
<BR><BR>Another more preferred embodiment is the compound of formula I wherein
     R.sup.1 is --CH.sub.2 OH.
<BR><BR>A more preferred embodiment is the essentially pure dextrorotatory or
     levorotatory isomer of the compound having formula I supra.
<BR><BR>The most preferred embodiment is the levorotatory isomer of compound I
     supra.
<BR><BR>When the process illustrated in Scheme II is employed, the compounds I are
     stereoselectively prepared as either the R or S isomer. When the synthesis
     employed is non-stereospecific, the compounds I are obtained as racemic
     mixture which must then be resolved if one desires to obtain the
     essentially pure R and S optical isomers.
<BR><BR>The racemic compounds of formula I may be resolved by forming a mixture of
     the two diastereoisomeric salts of said compounds with a dextrorotatory or
     levorotatory ring-substituted tartranilic acid, e.g., nitro, chloro or
     bromo substituted, separating said diastereoisomeric salts by fractional
     crystallization and converting the separated diastereoisomeric salts to
     the respective optical isomers of the compound preferably by treatment
     with a strong base, e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the
     like. (+)-2'-Nitrotartranilic acid and (+)-2'-chlorotartranilic acid are
     particularly useful in the resolution of the racemic compounds of Formula
     I. The general resolution procedure using tartranilic acids is described
     in U.S. Pat. No. 3,452,086 by T. A. Montzka et al, J. Org. Chem. 33, 3993
     (1968).
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I in the form of racemic mixtures or their
     dextrorotatory or levorotatory isomers possess learning enhancement
     activity making them useful for enhancing the learning capacity of
     mammals. The compounds while structurally related to amphetamine do not
     produce amphetamine-like central nervous system stimulant activity in
     mammals.
<BR><BR>The compounds of the invention were tested in a primary mouse screen.sup.1
     as illustrated in Table I. Most of the compounds exhibited some degree of
     stimulation which were characterized by clonic convulsions, tremors,
     irritability and ataxia when given orally at the indicated doses (mg/kg).
<BR><BR>.sup.1 S. Irwin, Psychopharmacol. 13, 222 (1968).
<BR><BR>These agents were also compared to R-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine
     (R-DOM) in terms of affecting cat behavior.sup.2. DOM-like activity was
     described as depression, dissassociation from the enviroment, catatonia,
     diarrhea, miosis, salivation, piloerection, arched back, and muscle
     rigidity. Reference compound
     (-)-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)butane hydrochloride
     (BL-3912A) had no effect on the behavior of the cat at 5-10 mg. mg./kg.
     s.c., while resulting in alertness, piloerection, mydriasis and some
     arching at 20 mg./kg. The results are found in Table I.

<BR><BR>One of the preferred compounds of the present invention (the 4-methylthio
     compound; BL-5485A) was compared with R-DOM for the facilitation of
     avoidance acquisition. The test animals were retired breeder rats of the
     Long-Evans strain (Blue Spruce Farms, Altamont, N.Y.). Experiments were
     conducted in automated shuttle cages (BRS/LVE, Model No. 146-04) contained
     within a light and sound-attenuated chamber equipped with a ventilation
     fan. Control of the shuttle box and recording of responses were
     accomplished by means of standard electromechanical modules. Injection of
     drugs i.p. and placement of the subjects into the shuttle cage were
     followed by a 1-minute pre-session acclimation period. The first avoidance
     trail was then initiated by activating a white light on the side of the
     shuttle cage occupied by the subject. If the animal did not cross to the
     other side of the chamber within 5 seconds (avoid), the grid floor under
     the animal was electrified with 0.8 mA of scrambled shock (BRS/LVE, Model
     No. 1531 shocker). Each subject received 120 avoidance trials during a 1
     hour session. The results of the test are shown in Table II.

<BR><BR>Table II shows that BL-5485A increased avoidance response at all doses
     tested while R-DOM increased avoidance response at one dosage and reduced
     it at all other doses tested.
<BR><BR>More specific tests also were employed to determine the presence or absence
     of undesirable psychotomimetic activity in the compounds of this
     invention. The test procedure is a modification of that described by
     Wallach et al. in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 182, 145-154 (1972).
<BR><BR>Various compounds are known to produce sensory distortions in man and
     characteristic responses in the act. These psychotomimetic effects
     (so-called hallucinogenic effects) in a compound under test are often
     compared with the effects produced by
     R-2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)propane (usually referred to as
     R-DOM). R-DOM is Compound 1 in the Table below, and was used as a
     comparison standard in the test.
<BR><BR>Adult female cats are housed in a large communal cage. On test day the
     animals are transferred to the observation room and placed into separate
     cages approximately 12-15 sq. feet in floor area with front wired door
     allowing observation of the cats. The animals can see the experimenter and
     each other across the room, and may have auditory and olfactory contact
     among themselves in adjacent cages. The experimental subjects are
     accustomed to this environment and settle down rapidly (&lt; 30 min.) after
     being brought in.
<BR><BR>The test compounds (initially 10 mg./kg.) are administered subcutaneously
     into the back of the neck. Following the dosing animals (N=2-4) are
     observed for 3 hrs. but the scoring is usually done at 1 hr. which usually
     corresponds to the time of peak effects induced by a compound. The effects
     are scored utilizing a check list containing 12 categories, each of which
     contains 2 sub-categories. Each sub-category is worth 1 point, giving a
     maximum numerical score of 24. The categories and sub-categories are as
     follows:
<BR><BR>1. Body Posture: Arched Back/Stiff Tail
<BR><BR>2. Extension of Limbs: Legs/Legs and Toes
<BR><BR>3. Muscle Rigidity: Legs/Abdomen
<BR><BR>4. Abnormal Leg Position/Immobility
<BR><BR>5. Motor Coordination: Ataxia/Loss of Righting Reflex
<BR><BR>6. Open Mouth/Protruding Tongue
<BR><BR>7. Claws Out/Attempts To Bite or Claw
<BR><BR>8. Teeth Baring/Hissing or Growling
<BR><BR>9. Contact with Environment: Reduced/Absent
<BR><BR>10. Piloerection: Tail/Back
<BR><BR>11. Pupillary Constriction: Moderate/Extreme
<BR><BR>12. Salivation/Emesis
<BR><BR>In addition to the above-described tests in cats, a hyperthermia test in
     rabbits was run with certain of the compounds. The ability of
     hallucinogenic phenylalkylamines to increase the rectal temperature of
     rabbits at low doses is well established (Aldous et al., 1974). The
     hyperthermia test is not absolutely predictive of the presence of
     psychotomimetic activity in a given compound, because this test detects
     some compounds which prove to be lacking psychotomimetic activity upon
     further evaluation. Nevertheless, this method provides a reliable
     quantitative measure of relative psychotomimetic potencies of compounds in
     a given series or once a given compound has been shown by other tests (as
     is here the case) to have such activity.
<BR><BR>The results of the foregoing test procedures are summarized in the
     following Table III. It should be noted that the test compounds were
     administered at 10 mg/kg while the comparison compounds, because of their
     high psychotomimetic activity were administered at 1 mg/kg.

</PRE>
<BR><BR>The results obtained in these tests show that:
<BR><BR>1. R-DOM produced marked psychotomimetic effects in the cat at 1 mg./kg..
<BR><BR>2. Test Compounds C, E and G, having .alpha.-methyl substitution on the
     aliphatic side-chain like R-DOM, have psychotomimetic effects in the cat
     which are very similar (in terms of potency and quality) to that of R-DOM.
<BR><BR>3. test Compounds B, D, F, H and I, having .alpha.-ethyl substitution on
     the aliphatic side-chain, exhibit practically no psychotomimetic effects
     (in the case of Compounds B, F, H and I) or a psychotomimetic effect which
     is approximately 18 times weaker than R-DOM (in the case of Compound D).
<BR><BR>4. the hyperthermia tests indicate that the psychotomimetic activity of
     Compound F (.alpha.-ethyl substitution on the aliphatic side-chain) is 80
     times weaker than its lower homolog (Compound E) and 20 times weaker than
     R-DOM.
<BR><BR>Thus, highly significant decreases in psychotomimetic properties (or the
     virtual absence thereof) were demonstrated in the 4-chloro-, 4-bromo-,
     4-methylthio- and 4-hydroxymethyl-compounds containing .alpha.-ethyl
     substitution on the aliphatic side-chain, when compared with their
     correspondingly 4-substituted lower homologs containing .alpha.-methyl
     substitution on the aliphatic side-chain and/or with R-DOM.
<BR><BR>The large decrease in psychotomimetic activity of the compounds of this
     invention as compared with their corresponding lower homologs is
     particularly surprising in view of Shulgin et al., Nature, 221, 537-541
     (1969), cited above. Those authors compared the psychotomimetic activity
     of a large number of substituted phenylalkylamines and found significant
     changes in psychotomimetic activity with changes of substituents and
     position of substitution on the phenyl ring, and also when increasing the
     side chain from ethylamino to propylamino. Only two of their compounds
     contained the same substitution in the phenyl ring, but with propylamino
     and butylamino side chains, respectively, namely compounds of the formula
     ##STR15##
     in which R was CH.sub.3 (their compound VIII) and C.sub.2 H.sub.5 (their
     compound XLIII). The activities of these compounds (reported as Mescaline
     Units; number of times as active as mescaline) were 2.2 M.U. for the
     propylamino compound and &lt;2 M.U. for the butylamino compound. The authors
     stated that "there seems to be a decrease" in psychotomimetic activity in
     going from propylamino to butylamino, but cautioned that the M.U. values
     should not be considered accurate to closer than .+-. 25%.
<BR><BR>The compound BL-3912A, a reference compound used in assaying the compounds
     of this invention, has demonstrated remarkable and profound effects in
     initial clinical studies in psychotics and normal senile geriatric
     patients. For example, in psychotics demonstrating schizophrenia and manic
     depression, a dose of 50 to 100 mg per day produced remarkable results in
     that virtually all the patients so treated behaved in a near normal
     manner. The catatonics relaxed, the withdrawn and fearful became sociable,
     etc.
<BR><BR>In the non-psychotic geriatric patient, at a dose of 25 to 50 mg/day,
     BL-3912A had the effect of producing increased mental alertness and a
     renewed interest in life characterized by increased sociability, mobility,
     concern about appearance, dress and general well-being.
<BR><BR>In two instances where the patient had Parkinson's disease, substantially
     complete remission of the symptoms of the disease was observed at a dose
     of 100 mg/day.
<BR><BR>The ability of BL-3912A to increase the learning capacity of humans has
     been confirmed in the initial clinical trials.
<BR><BR>In view of all the above and in projecting the activity found in rodents to
     humans, it is anticipated the compounds of the instant invention will
     possess activity in man that is essentially identical to that seen for
     BL-3912A.
<BR><BR>The compounds I of the instant invention can be prepared by several
     alternative methods as illustrated by the following diagramatic schemes:

     refluxed for 30 mins. A solution of 23.73 g (0.10 mole) of
     1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitro-1-butane in 100 ml of anhydrous THF was
     then added dropwise at reflux. After addition was complete, the mixture
     was stirred and refluxed for 24 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled to
     0.degree. and then was decomposed by the cautious dropwise addition, with
     rapid stirring, of 25 ml of H.sub.2 O and 100 ml of THF. The cooling bath
     was removed and 25 ml of 10% NaOH solution, followed by 25 ml. of H.sub.2
     O was added dropwise; the mixture was stirred until a granular white solid
     was obtained. The inorganic salts were filtered and washed well with THF.
<BR><BR>The filtrate was evaporated and the oil thus obtained was partitioned
     between very dilute NaOH solution and Et.sub.2 O. The layers were
     separated and the aqueous was extracted well with Et.sub.2 O. The combined

     dried over anhydrous Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4. The desiccant was filtered, the
     filtrate was evaporated to ca. 100 ml., and the salt was precipitated with
     HCl (g). The solvent and excess HCl were removed under reduced pressure
     and the residue was flashed down twice with EtOAc. The solid was
     recrystallized from CH.sub.3 CN to give 9.71 of title product as colorless
     crystals; mp 175.degree.-177.degree.. The filtrate was cooled and

     1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenyl]-2-nitro-1-butene. An additional 20 ml
     of THF is added to dissolve and wash all the nitro compound into the THF
     mixture. Refluxing is continued for seven hours. The mixture is cooled and
     ice water (3.4 ml) slowly added to decompose the excess lithium aluminum
     hydride. When the decomposition is complete, the mixture is filtered and
     the solid cake washed with THF. The filtrate is evaporated in vacuo to
     produce crude 2-amino-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenyl)butane. The
     crude is purified as the hydrochloride salt by recrystallization from
     isopropanol.
