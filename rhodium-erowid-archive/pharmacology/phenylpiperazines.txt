Subject: TFMPP 4 sale from C.R.S.B. vs. MDMA (my personal experiences)

   From: Tom Kasper <wirehead@sb.net>

TFMPP (3-Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine) is available from Chemical Resale
of Santa Barbara. Details of the purchase of this legal research chemical
can be found on the C.R.S.B. homepage at: http://www.sb.net/wirehead

Well. My my my my. I am a clumsy chemist...

There I was in my lab weighing out 3-Trifluoromethylphenypiperazine HCl
into 5 gram cobalt blue glass vials while enjoying my lunch of Kentucky
Fried... Now I know better than to be wedgeing on the grindage next to
open bottles of chemicals, but, that chicken tasted soooo good that I just
couldn't put it down...

I guess I must have accidentally spilled about 100 mg. of TFMPP on my
chicken!  Me and my poor lab techniques!  I didn't even notice my spill!

Of course, when i bit down on that chicken leg, I tasted the bitter taste,
but too late. I had already swallowed...

This was tuesday afternoon at about 5:00 pm, and I was scheduled to go to
the Carlos Santana concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl at 6:30 pm.
What to do, what to do?

Well, I couldn't dissapoint my beautiful date... I decided not to say
anything. I stopped wedgeing on the chicken and left it out on the
workbench (a mistake).

When my beautiful date arrived, she saw the chicken and decided to have a
bite. She too accidentally ingested a little which must have accidentally
spilled on another piece of chicken. Oh well...

We arrived at the S.B.C.B. for the concert feeling no effect from the
ingestion at about 6:30 pm.

By the time Santana started playing however, we were feeling the effect of
the accidental ingestion of chemical TFMPP... In my estimation, it was
similar to, but MORE euphoriant than MDMA which I had accidentally ingested
some years back, when it was still legal.

The toxic symptoms of ingestion included:

1)  Increased socialibility
2)  Increased desire to touch and love
3)  Enhanced tactile sensations (it felt good to touch things)
4)  A feeling of "oneness" with the crowd, and with my date
5)  A desire to be very close and to share love with my date

Now if you have never seen a Santana show, it is very 60s. "Peace, light,
joy,  love... You must spread these things"  etc.

From our perfect seats in the center of the hand carved rock bowl, situated
outdoors amid beautiful trees and rolling hills, the experience was, on a
scale from one to 10, a 10!

I am writing this for education purposes, so that YOU can avoid accidental
toxic effects from this chemical...

Now please bear in mind that the government of the United States of America
has legislated morality such that I am obligated to remind you that the 5
toxic effects of accidental ingestion of TFMPP listed above are, per the
U.S. govt. "TOXIC" effects.

I must also remind you that my sloppy lab technique is, in no way
acceptable, and that I will be certain never to purposefully ingest any
chemical ever unless it is prescribed by a bona-fied doctor who charges at
least $50.00 per visit and made by a huge corporate drug manufacturer with
grossly inflated prices and Calvinist policies. Anything else might cause
some special elite FBI group to userp the laws of this great country and
act as judge, jury and god and try to execute me on some airplane
someplace...

Well. Me and my poor lab technique!  Whats a chemist to do?

You see I was measuring out 5 gram bottles of the latest addition to the
Chemical Resale of Santa Barbara catalog, 3-chlorophenylpiperazine. The
repetitive task set my mind to thinking of the Rolling Stones concert
that I would attend that evening, and somehow I accidentally spilled two
30 mg. portions of 3-CPP on two tacos that were laying beside the weigh
station. Silly me!

Well I ate one of the tacos. At just 30 mg., I did not taste the
spilled chemical and continued with my task. This was about 5:00 pm.

My very beautiful date arrived at about 5:15 and feeling hungry ate the
other tainted taco. My My My My!

The limo arrived to take us to Dodger Stadium at about 6:00. At this
point I realized that I must have accidentally ingested some 3-CPP. I
informed my beautiful date of the situation and we decided to make notes
about the experience.

By comparison, this chemical was not nearly as hallucinogenic as TFMPP,
but it had more MDMA like body feeling. There was definite mood
elevation after some slight nausea and body flushing that was similar to
a "niacin flush". After that, smooth sailing!

The chemical experience added to the concert, though a night club would
have been a better choice, had the ingestion been conscious. Oh well.

For researchers searching for legal substitutes for MDMA to use use on
their laboratory primates, I think this chemical will be useful.

3-CPP (3-cholorphenylpiperazine) is available from Chemical Resale of
Santa Barbara http://www.sb.net./wirehead for $97.00 for 5 grams.

Research chemicals can be truly dangerous!  Accidental ingestion of even
small amounts can produce unwanted toxic symptoms.

The toxic symptoms of MDMA are reported to be  _very_ similar to
1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine monohydrochloride

The amount of MDMA necessary to cause toxic symptoms is almost 200mg, I
believe.
The amount of 1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine monohydrochloride is
less than 30mg!

My point?

Please be careful.

Toxic symptoms include euphoria, lowering of inhibitions, feelings of
empathy, elevated pulse and systolic etc.

MDMA, like 1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine monohydrochloride is a
chemical which should not be consumed by humans.

Substance: TMFPP
Dosage: about 100mg
Duration: 2-3 hours plus tail

Around 12:30 on a nice day I ( a purely fictional "I" ) decided to try this 
substance of which I could find exactly two quotations on all of the WWW - a 
little snippet in Shulgin's PiHKAL (in the section on PEA) and one, single, 
measly trip-report...

So I dropped some of it onto a sugar-cube and ingested it. It is liquid at 
room-temperature, and at least with my eye-dropper, one drop came out to be 
between 20 and 25mg -- four drops made 87mg and with a little nudging I managed 
to get a half-drop onto the cube for a total of 102mg (yes, my scale is that 
good). This was ingested around 12:45.

I made the mistake of taking the "sublingual"-stance too literally and held 
the cube in my mouth for a minute or two -- for twenty minutes or so afterward 
my mouth was essentially numb. The substance seems highly caustic and swallowing 
it in a gel-cap with a glass of water probably would've been a cleverer way of 
ingestion.

Alert at 30min, peak after about an hour. Lasts for two or three hours, then 
decline.

The general impression was that of a mild, pleasant, mellow trippyness. 
Thoughts flowing freely, but nothing that would "whack me over the head". Full 
control over everything at all times. OEVs present but borderline (requiring 
concentration). CEVs mild, pleasant, unspectacular. Call it half a hit of LSD.

Contrary to what I had read, there was no jaw-clenching or speedy impression. 
Actually, a light tremor in my hands was the only peripheral effect I could 
detect. I didn't even have dilated pupils. In the evening, I went to bed around 
my usual time (11pm or so) and had no trouble falling asleep -- if anything, I 
felt exhausted from the activity in my brain.

I'd rate this as between "+" and "++" on the Shulgin-scale and maybe "2" on 
Graeme Carl's scale.

Maybe I'm a hardened bastard -- but this whole experience left me utterly 
unimpressed. I will try this again at higher dosages. 

================================================================================

I'll make another comment on the nature of the 4 combo piperazine effects. The 
drugs seem to have a profound effect on your sleep cycle, especially regarding 
dreaming. From my experience, and that of others I have conferred with, the 
piperazines together will dramatically increase the intensity and duration of 
your dreams the night, not of the day you ingest the chems, but the that of the 
day after. I've read reports of the drug Serzone having a similar effect on 
dreaming, and one of it's metabolites is MPP, I believe.

I may be mistaken, but I recollect reading the results of a study which showed 
that MPP would allow some of the subjects to enter into rem sleep at an earlier 
stage, perhaps level II sleep. Check medline, search under MPP and you should 
come up with many hits.

Anecdotally I'll confirm this. The dreams I have are frighteningly realistic, 
and I wake up intermittantly, but fall asleep moments later, and the dreams 
continue rather uninterupted unlike usual. This would suggest that I am dreaming 
while still in a much lighter sleep. I chop back and forth between being asleep 
and awake that I can no longer tell which is which. I am exceptionally aware 
during these dreams, and I often hear myself giving a running commentary on 
what's happening. Also, the sensations experienced in the dreams are very 
strong, I can sense touch, smell, and taste to a far greater degree than usual. 
I still find the whole experience rather confusing, but I imagine if one 
practiced and learned how to control it that this would be a very attractive 
quality of the drugs. It somewhat resembles the hallucinations one has on high 
doses of dissasociates, ie completely immersive and realistic, except that you 
are much more aware and in control. By the way, I've never experienced anything 
like this after taking just BZP with TFMPP. I believe that the MPP in probably 
necessary for this effect.

Subject: TFPP dosage and effects
Date: Tue, 23 Sep 1997 00:53:01 GMT

I received the following report from an acquaintance of mine who asked me
to post the following:

A 37 year old 220 pound male accidentally swallowed an approximate 80mg of
TFPP. The substance had spilled on a banana which covered the slightly
bitter but not repulsive taste.
The first effects were felt after 1 hour. After 2 hours the experience had
tremendously intensified, leaving the individual in a state of high anxiety
and mostly visual hallucinations. The experience was very frightening
considering the person had not expected a such strong psychedelic
progression. In an attempt the male consumed a third of a bottle of cognac
and 150 to 200 mg of Trazodone, a very strong sleep inducing SRI. At the
same time he was talked through the reaction by a friend. It took ~ 4 hours
before the individual finally fell unconscious. Sleep disturbance lasted
for another 3 days.

Having consumed the now illegal drug MDMA before the reaction was described
as being that of a severed overdose of MDMA. The person in question
suggests that a much smaller does of 15-30mg is indicated.

It would appear as if the effects while frightening were only of short-term
nature and a regular dose would most likely not be felt twelve hours after
ingestion. The actual experience can be assumed to be only 4 hours.

BZP & TFMPP euphoriants like MDMA and Meth...

Here is a quote from a letter from a resercher who is using TFMPP and
BZP HCl in his studies:

"Benzylpiperazine Hydrochloride (BZP HCl) simulates methamphetamine use
in lab animals. It is a strong anorexic. Anorexic capacity is
frequently equated with euphoriant capacity... My observations show
this correlation to be true.

3-Trifluofomethylphenylpiperazine Monohydrochloride (TFMPP), mimics MDMA
in lab animals. A combination of BZP HCl and TFMPP has been observed to
cause activity that is prefered to MDMA in chemical discrimination tests
with lab animals.

A ratio of 2 parts BZP HCl to 1 part TFMPP was used for these chemical
descrimination tests. Larger laboratory primates were given 200 mg. of
BZP HCl mixed with 100 mg. of TFMPP. Observed activity appeared to last
from 6 to 10 hours. There was an increased sociability observed in all
animals given this preparation.

Loss of apetite was observed both in the BZP HCl only group and the BZP
HCL and TFMPP (2:1) group."

From what I have gathered, a good rough starting dosage for TFMPP and 3-CPP
would be around 100mg, with 250 or so being a good hard dose. I would
assume that the BZP would be a good addition to this, addinga speedy effect,
and making it more suitible for dancing. Maybe 250mg to start, up to maybe
500-1000mg in a night. I think 150-200mg of 3-CPP and 375mg of BZP could
probobly masquerade as a good hit of E.

TFMPP Experience

A few days ago I ingested exactly 100 mgs of TFMPP, hoping to get
something out of it. The effects came on in about 30 minutes, but there
was no euphoria. Instead, it felt like I took super strong Prozac, it
didn't feel bad or good, very neutral. I experienced a slight
nervousness of the stomach, but this wasn't unbearable. After about two
hours I was feeling pretty disappointed in the TFMPP and I lit up just a
small amount of marijuana. Then the strangest thing happened!  The
stomach nervousness disappeared, and I felt and  extremely powerful
euphoria, a very clear high, that I have never felt before. It was as
if the TFMPP multiplied the effect of the marijuana by 1000.

So I think that TFMPP doesn't work alone, but can be used to magnify the
effects of other drugs. I wouldn't be suprised if in the future ecstacy
pills are cut with TFMPP, or perhaps they are already cut with TFMPP..

                  Later!

Well, allow me hypothesise:  Both TFMPP and CPP,  I believe, are
seratonin agonists. CPP's sertonic action is probably more akin to 2-CB
and TFMPP's sertonic action is more akain to that of MDMA.

I think that ingesting BZP would probably increase the subjective
euphoric of both TFMPP and CPP greatly. I have read in some studies of
2-CB that conclude that often, people feel little or no euphoria with
2-CB, but find that 2-CB combined with MDMA greatly enhances the
euphoria of the MDMA.

So here's my hypothesises:  1) TFMPP or CPP alone don't have much
subjective effect. 2) TFMPP combined with BZP would yield a similar
subjective experience to MDMA and 3) TFMPP combined with both BZP and
CPP would yield a subjective comprable to the subjective experience of
MDMA combined with 2-CB.

This is indeed a very intresting area of research!

In my primate research, I have noticed a similar effect. The TFMPP
acts as a sensory and mood enhancer. Feelings are magnified, whether
good or bad. If my animals are being entertained by various pleasant
external stimuli (music, lights, sexual touch, etc.), they show signs
of euphoria. In the absence of such stimuli, the TFMPP seems to
accentuate their boredom and depression.

This effect is quite noticeable at dosages as low as 100 micrograms
(administered in water under the tongue) in my 75kg primates. I find
it surprising that other researchers are reporting dosage levels of a
thousand times this much in their experiments. Are the effects
nonlinear with respect to dosage?  At doses under a milligram, side
effects such as muscle tension and "hangovers" are virtually
nonexistant. Additionally, administering the medication orally is
much easier, as it has only a mild taste in these concentrations.

TFMPP, BZP (Benzylpiperazine)

--- Experiment #1 ---

I recently got ahold of some TFMPP, or 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine
Hydrochloride. Depending on who you ask, TFMPP is supposed to cause effects 
almost exactly like MDMA.

I ate 100 mg in a gelcap. I started to feel trippy effects a little before
the one hour point, and effects reached full intensity by around 2.5 hours.
The comedown began at the 5 or 6 hour point and I was not completely back
to normal until 11 or 12 hours.

Quite simply, it was not MDMA. There were some skin sensations that seemed
like they could be MDMA-like, but there was none of the incredible
emotional release of MDMA. However, there was no question that I was
tripping. My thought patterns were trippy, things would breathe slightly if
I looked very carefully for it, and music had a trippy edge. A little
marijuana seemed to enhance the effects some. My pupils were dilated, my
jaw was clenched just a little towards the end of the trip, and I was quite
thirsty - at least the physical effects were similar to MDMA.

--- Experiment #2 ---

35 mg was taken several days later. This, too, was mixed with marijuana
after a while. No quantifiable effects were noticed, so it can be concluded
that 100 mg was not any kind of overdose.

--- Experiment #3 ---

135 mg was taken after a couple more days. Effects were very similar to 100
mg. Both 100 mg and 135 mg left me with substantial headaches. In both
cases, the effects could be categorized as a 1 on the Lycaeum's scale.
TFMPP seems to only give a very mild trip, and as far as psychedelics go,
it's not really "good", but it is psychedelic. No question about that.

--- Experiment #4 ---

After more research, I came across some reports that claim that TFMPP needs
to be mixed with other piperazines to fully recreate the MDMA effect. I now
obtained some benzylpiperazine (BZP) freebase. 50 mg of TFMPP hydrochloride
and 90 mg BZP freebase were dissolved in acidic fruit juice. The taste,
even in fruit juice, was absolutely vile.

The plan was for another evening of marijuana usage with friends, but I
held off on the pot until I was able to take note of the effects of the
TFMPP/BZP combo. The BZP added a significant speedy effect that was very
similar to MDMA. TFMPP's very mild skin sensation was amplified by the BZP,
and I felt some degree of pleasure in touching other people. There was
still no massive emotional release as with MDMA, nor was there any sort of
absolutely clean, pure feeling. But I noticed that the set of effects taken
as a whole actually was moving in the general direction of MDMA. The 50/90
combo is a fairly low dose, but I decided to start on the safe side.

This combo shows some promise. Marijuana had some effect, but it was subtle
and probably only consisted of a "mellowing," like pot has on many other
psychedelics. It may have accentuated my ability to take note of what I was
feeling.

--- Other Experimental Subjects ---

Since I now had some idea of the reasonable dose range for these two drugs,
I decided to let my friends do some experimenting too. I distributed
several 75 mg TFMPP HCl / 150 mg BZP freebase doses to a few people who
were experienced with MDMA, and I later talked to them about their
experiences. In general, people mentioned the speedy effect and the
skin-sensation effects. Most felt that it was lacking the MDMA magic.
However, some people pointed out that the effects that were there lasted
quite a bit longer than MDMA, and this was generally viewed as a good
thing. No one had a chance to explore the emotional disinhibition
properties. One friend who often vomits on psychedelics vomited after
dosing with the combo. Without exception, the subjects consider the
TFMPP/BZP combo to be a worthwhile trip.

One friend who is quite experienced with MDMA use and with dancing on MDMA
reports that, when she took a 75/150 TFMPP/BZP combo at a concert, she
found dancing to be very enjoyable in a way that was essentially the same
as MDMA. Another friend later agreed with this assessment. So it would seem
that TFMPP/BZP may be particularly useful as an MDMA substitute for raves
and similar events, where MDMA's emotional effects take a backseat to the
physical joy of dancing.

--- Experiment #5 ---

After the positive reports I'd heard from my friends, and since I finally
had some more free time, I decided to do a 90/180 combo. I had used MDMA
two times recently, 7 and 10 days previously, and both were truly outstanding
experiences, so my mind had been refreshed about all the relevant
characteristics of a good MDMA trip.

The combo came on slow. There was no MDMA-like rush. It took about two
hours to reach full intensity. There was definitely not the same MDMA
emotional characteristics, and I doubt there would be any even at higher
doses. So we can rule out the possibility of this combo really mimicing
MDMA. However, the overall feel I had was one of extreme pleasantness and
contentedness. There were skin sensations that were very similar to MDMA.
Not the same - but still, very similar, and enjoyable. Dancing and similar
movement was really fun, and I now understand why my friend said she
enjoyed dancing on this combo like she does on MDMA.

The trip certainly lasts long. The plateau is, maybe, from the 1.5 to 4.5
hour points. The comedown is very slow, subtle, and not at all unenjoyable.
At the 10 hour point, I could still clearly feel the drugs, but they were
in the background and continued to fade slowly. The trip seemed to come in
waves every few minutes, with a new feeling of tingling of the skin, a new
feeling of pleasantness, and a new surge of positive trippy energy. BZP on
its own behaves very similar to amphetamines, and I definitely felt a more
speedy characteristic with this combo than with MDMA. There was significant
jaw-clenching and dry mouth.

About 10.5 hours after dosing, I fell asleep. My sleep was fitful and
uncomfortable. I woke up for dinner, ate, and then fell asleep for an hour
again. It took several hours of wakefulness after that final hour-long nap
(a total of about 24 hours after dosing) for me to feel completely normal
again. I suspect this is because I was already sleepy when I first dosed,
and the drugs kept me very awake until they wore off, at which point I
crashed hard. My "next day" feelings were probably more negative than they
would normally be on the TFMPP/BZP combo.

--- Conclusions ---

TFMPP on its own is kinda boring. But it may have its uses. If you want a
mild trip, with the mental effects but no visuals or sensory disruption,
TFMPP will give it to you. It could be used as a way to stay awake; a
friend used some this way. However, outside of a couple of narrow uses (and
you'd have to try it at least once to see how it could be useful for you),
TFMPP on its own seems to be mostly a curiosity, and not too worthy of
serious consideration as a psychedelic.

However, when mixed with BZP, TFMPP takes on a whole new character. As one
of my friends reported earlier, she felt that TFMPP/BZP was very good for
dancing, in a way that was quite similar to MDMA, and I agree with her. It
does not behave like MDMA, but regardless, the combo is plenty of fun in
and of itself; it's definitely now on my list of "preferred psychedelics".
It's a wonderful mind-altering but not mind-fucking combo that lends itself
very well to social situations, whether that's at a rave, or with just a
few friends. It cannot match MDMA's emotional disinhibition qualities, but
I can totally understand how people would compare the two. MDMA's core
feeling of everything being all right with the world, and its sensation of
giving "authenticity" to whatever you might experience on the drug, is
there with the combo, and it's awfully enjoyable. I recommend it.

I hope to be able to conduct some more experiments with 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-
piperazine hydrochloride and 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride,
two more piperazines that can supposedly modulate the TFMPP/BZP combo in
all sorts of interesting trippy ways. More reports will be forthcoming once
I get a chance to give these a try.

================================================================================
TFMPP:

50 mg, oral: 

slight effects - mild trippyness: this is not a placebo, but that is pretty much
all I know. Out in two or three hours.

100mg oral:

Alert after 25 or so minutes, peak from t+1h to t+2.5 hours or so -- then fades
out. Trippy mind-set, freely floating thought. Clear presence of CEVs - pretty,
yet unspectacular. It is not "good" or "bad": A very un-emotional trip. It's
there and that's that.

100mg oral plus 200mg BZP oral:

a) We had to deliver our cat to friends who would take care for her over a week
   we were going to be gone. The substances were ingested before leaving for the
   metro, and 25 minutes later, sitting in the station I felt quite intoxicated
   and wondered whether I'd make the train-ride. I peaked pretty much somewhere
   during the metro-ride. Interestingly my stomach settled quite well - maybe
   because I was sitting orthogonal to the riding-direction, maybe because I was
   concentrating on the cat which was frightened in her carrier-box.
   The prospect of encountering so many people in a very disorganized mind-state
   would've been frightening without my straight partner around. Later at the
   friends house, perfectly fine conversations (none of the scatterbrain that
   acid gives me). Quite social: clear urge to communicate and connect. Quite an
   insomnia-tail. No appetite all day, and none the next day either.

b) At about t+30min I decided to distract myself from my stomach that felt just
   as upset as last time. Went furniture-shopping. Clear appreciation for the
   different textures and "feels" of the sofas and the different materials used
   to make the bureaus we looked at. Again, clearly enhanced openness, urge to
   communicate and connect, lowered inhibitions to say things that may sound
   strange. At t+1.5h, went back home to drink some ginger-tea which helped me
   overcome the remaining twinges of nausea. Spent the rest of the day wandering
   through the nearby park which helped getting me physically exhausted and
   thereby alleviated the insomnia-tail a little.

Muscle-stiffness in both experiences (a) and (b), felt more strongly the first
time when I couldn't move around. This would do well for dancing or similar
physical activity.

200mg BZP alone:

As one would have expected: the same empathic and social feeling minus the
visuals which apparently came more from the TFMPP. Active, communicative,
considerably less nausea. Less of a perception that I'm "tripping", which I am
very aware of when on TFMPP alone. Tricky, since this seems to alter my
behaviour more than TFMPP.

================================================================================

Well, this is what someone could say about 90 TMFPP, 80 BZP, 80 MPP, 35 CPP.
Someone got dialated pupils and had visuals like: the carpet moving and
swirling, disproportiation when looking at his body, and shroom-like detail of
skin and clouds. Someone would attribute these effects to the TMFPP. There were
the hot and cold flashes like MDMA (CPP?). And like MDMA it seemed the
temperature could be controled by one's mind. Someone could also contol one's
mind in physical activities like whether waliking or carrying a bottle of water
was an extremely heavy and tiring task or not even noticable(BZP+MPP?). No
really speedy effects were noticed. Smoking weed was definately an uplifting
experience. Someone would categorize this combo as not like the euphoria of
extacy, but more of a light trip. Several of the four people experimenting
experienced mild to harsh headaches. This combo was not found to be especially
pleasant for social interaction with those not on it. Mild nausea was
experienced by someone, but not everyone. This was mainly attributed to the
large size of pill and quantity of basic substance in stomach. I tried to be as
detailed as possible. Hope this helps. Questions welcome.

================================================================================

I have dreamt that the headache comes from the TFMPP, since any combo containing
it (or it alone) caused a severe migraine-like headache. BZP alone does not
cause this type of reaction, and I have not dreamt of CPP or MPP alone, so
cannot vouch for their effectiveness in the absence of TFMPP. Note that the
TFMPP does cause mild LSD-like hallucinogenic effects, but one is better off
dreaming with the more traditional fare. The headache is not worth the
experience. I'm relieved this was all a dream, because that headache really
sucked!!

================================================================================

With reports from several friends, concerning BZP-HCl (100-150 mgs)/ TFMPP-HCl
(40-80 mgs) mixes, I have several widely varied reports, some with stomach
pains, not attributable to anything else, some with MDMA-like 'pure love'
feelings enjoyed while having sex, some with only slight effects, some with very
euphoric-sociable-dancing moods, and some with reports of it being better than
LSD (coming from a 2-3 time per week user.) BZP is a stimulant, that's for sure,
but not quite as 'rewarding' and 'addicting' as amphetamine/methamphetamine,
possibly because of it's inablity to be carried around so easily in one's pocket
and insufflated whenever one wants. TFMPP is a hallucinogen (expensive, too)
that has a peak from 2-4 hours into the trip, with another 2-3 hours to come
down, with residual tracer effects lasting beyond 12 hours.

================================================================================

Now I'm a little puzzled: what do you mean "[piperazines are] not in the Merck
Index or other medical-type journal"? There seem to be enough literature-refs
around -- I have posted a bunch right here at the Lycaeum. I am currently
looking into these chemicals myself, but of course they haven't seen decades of
abuse and hence there isn't much data on reactions in man.

If you're looking for "real scientific information" about, say, BZP, you could
access medline somewhere and simply look for 2759-28-6 or 72878-35-4 in the
keywords or abstract (these are the CAS-numbers of 1-benzylpiperazine and the
HCl salt). You'd get a couple hits and read the abstracts and retrieve the
articles and there you'd have "real scientific information".

For example:

* Glennon, R.A., et al (1989)
  Binding of arylpiperazines to 5-HT3 serotonin receptors:
  results of a structure-affinity study.
  Eur. J. Pharm. 168: 387-392.

  Which covers a lot of ground and worked quite well for me as an intro to
  this class of substances. 5-HT3, of course, isn't a particularly "visionary"
  receptor...

As it turns out, the most interesting of the four "commonly abused" piperazines
is mCPP (1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine) since it has the highest specificity.
Accordingly, there's an abundance of published research about it. For example:

*  Lucki et al (1989)
   Effect of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)-
   piperazine on locomotor activity.
   J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 249: 155.

  Which, as the title suggests, investigates TFMPP as well - the latter is just
  of less pharmacological interest.

Or how about

* Curzon et al (1990)
  m-CPP: A tool for studying behavioural responses associated with 5-HT1C
  receptors.
  TiPS 11: 181.

* Baxter et al (1995)
  5-HT2 receptor subtypes: A family reunited?
  TiPS 16: 105.

  That has a lot research in terms of behaviour rather than pharmacology.
  Is that what you're looking for?

You mentioned metabolizm:

* Sugimoto et al (1996)
  Effects of the 5-HT2C/2B receptor agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine on
  plasma glucose levels of rats.
  Eur. J. Pharmacol. 307: 75.

Fone et al (1998)
Effect of chronic m-CPP on locomotion, hypophagia, plasma
corticosterone and 5-HT2C receptor levels in the
rat. Br.J.Pharmacol. 123 1707.

On a more general level, but dealing a little more with TFMPP again, there's

* Schoeffter and Hoyer (1989)
  Interaction of arylpiperazines with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D
  receptors: do discriminatory 5-HT1B receptor ligands exist? Naunyn-Schmied
  Arch Pharmacol. 339 675.

If your interest is more on the receptor/pharmacology-side (as is mine), you'll
find that there are many more piperazines than the commonly touted four. Many of
them actually more interesting than those. Like 1-[3-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenoxy)
propyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (BP-554) which is a straight Selective 5-HT1A agonist
(which rings the AMT(IT-290)-bell in my head at least).

* Glennon et al (1988)
  Arylpiperazine derivatives as high affinity 5-HT1A serotonin ligands.
  J.Med.Chem. 31 1968.

Or even better: 1-(3-Chlorophenyl)-4-hexylpiperazine which seems to play on the
structure of the previous but without the ugly aromatic ring at the end.

Or what looks to me to be the most promising, actually: MK 212
(6-Chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine), which is very highly 2C-selective

* Conn and Sanders-Bush (1987)
  Relative efficacies of piperazines at the phosphoinositide hydrolysis-linked
  serotonergic (5-HT2 and 5-HT1C) receptors.
  J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 242 552.

and seems to be quite psychotropically interesting...:

* Lee et al (1992)
  Effect of the serotonin agonist, MK-212, on body temperature in schizophrenia.
  Biol. Psychiatry 31 460.

...and there are many more. All it takes is following references in one paper to
another one. For example

* Hoyer, D. (1988)
  Functional correlates of serotonin 5-HT1 recognition sites.
  J. Recept. Res. 8: 59-81

  Which opens the door to a world of analogs, homologs, variations - if there's
  ever a PiHKAL of the piperazine-world, it'll build on this one, I suppose...

Some day, I'm going to make a web-page about these interesting little buggers,
I promise :) - there's intersting and surprizing pharmacology all around these
double-ring strucures...

-- GF (randomly throwing out some information)

================================================================================

I understand that TFMPP is a slightly 5-HT[1B] selective partial agonist, with
similar potency at 5-HT[1A] and 5-HT[2C] receptors. BZP seems to be a 5HT[3]
agonist only.

There's something interesting here but I can't put my finger on it...

Baxter et al (1995)
5-HT2 receptor subtypes: A family reunited? TiPS 16 105.

Glennon R.A., et al (1988)
Arylpiperazine derivatives as high affinity 5-HT1A serotonin ligands.
J.Med.Chem. 31 1988.

Glennon, R.A., et al. (1989)
Binding of arylpiperazines to 5-HT3 serotonin receptors: results of a
structure-affinity study. Eur. J. Pharm. 168: 387-392.

Another interesting reference:

Hoyer, D. (1988)
Functional correlates of serotonin 5-HT1 recognition sites.
J. Recept. Res. 8:59-81

...goes in the direction I had been thinking of in an earlier post:
4-Phenylpiperidine, 1-(2-Pyrimidinyl)piperazine, 1-naphtyl-Piperazine...

Why would these double-ring systems have any effect on 5HT receptors at all? And
why selectively? There seems to be a large number of interesting substances out
there and it is completely nebulous to me what mechanism they derive their
activity from...

================================================================================

What is piperazine monohydrochloride?

Does anyone know anything about 1-3(-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine 
monohydrochloride? It is supposedly similar to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. 
Someone posted to Northwest Raves that it was for sale "for research only", 
unscheduled (i.e. legal), and that 30 mg was equivalent to 200 mg MDMA.

Reply from Dave Nichols

I've seen no human studies to know its effects. It appears to be a rather 
nonspecific serotonergic agent.

It releases serotonin, and also seems to directly stimulate the 5-HT2A/2C 
receptors, but supposedly being more selective for the 2C and perhaps only a 
partial agonist at the 5-HT2A. Its chloro analogue MCPP I know has been given 
to humans, and the effects, if I remember, were more anxiety-provoking, and 
were described in one study as "depersonalization." I think TFMPP would 
clearly have psychoactive effects. The dose range sounds right. It's safety 
for human use has not been established, but it would likely be safer than 
MCPP, which has been given to humans, because the trifluoromethyl is quite 
more inert to metabolism than a chlorine atom.

If I personally were going to try the experiment, I'd start at 5 mg, then 
10, 18, and 30, in steps, to assure myself that nothing unpleasant might 
occur at an initial try of 30.

My personal thinking is that dopamine release is important to the action 
of ecstasy. I find no references right at hand to suggest that TFMPP has 
this effect at all. Thus, a priori, I should suspect that its similarity 
to ecstasy might be remote. There are many people who lack the discrimination 
to tell the difference between a Lafite-Rothschild 1932 and a Gallo 1997, or
perhaps a better analogy would be that they cannot discern the former from a 
Budweiser. At first blush, my opinion, purely my opinion, would be that 
TFMPP would have such a 'resemblance' to ecstasy. If in fact TFMPP is very 
similar, or extremely similar to ecstsasy, then I would VERY MUCH like to 
know that from someone who has discriminating tastes.

AB: Fluoxetine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) were
studied for their short-term effects on electroencephalographic
sleep in male rats. Following single injection, each drug produced
a sizeable, dose-related suppression of rapid-eye-movement (REM)
sleep that persisted for 4-5 h (fluoxetine, 0.625-5 mg/kg; TFMPP,
0.10-1.25 mg/kg). TFMPP also consistently increased non-REM (NREM)
sleep during the second hour after drug injection, though this
effect was not dose-related (it was seen at all doses tested).
Fluoxetine produced small effects on NREM sleep that varied
non-systematically with dose and time after drug injection. TFMPP,
but not fluoxetine, also increased at all doses the number of delta
waves per minute of NREM sleep in the second hour. A structural
analog of TFMPP that is inactive at serotonin (5-HT) receptors
[4-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperadine; LY97117] was also tested,
and found to be devoid of effects on NREM and REM sleep. Both
fluoxetine (a 5-HT reuptake blocker) and TFMPP (a 5-HT agonist)
enhance transmission across 5-HT synapses, though by different
mechanisms. Because they have the common effect of suppressing REM
sleep, and in a dose-related manner, the data support the notion
that 5-HT neurons in the brain, when active, can suppress REM sleep.

See wirehead is a little crazy, but aint we all?

BZP - benzylpiperazine HCl makes 3-CPP -3-chlorophenylpiperazine and
3-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine and 4-methoxypiperazine work real good.

The 3-trifluoro is the visuals. The 3-CPP is the body feelings. 
The 4-methoxy is the body calming and the BZP makes it all work.

Want more visuals? Add 3-Trifluoro. Want more body feelings? add more 3-CPP.

I use 1/8 gram of BZP with 1/8 gram of 3-trifluoro and 30mg of 3-CPP and
75mg of 4-methoxy.

This is the best!

.TFMPP experiences. 
.I was quite stoked at the prospect of finding a readily accessible chemical 
.which evidently induced a similar state of Euphoria as that resulting from 
.MDMA. 

.My first experience.
.I received my shipment from CRSB (in a very timely manner), and quickly cut 
.out a small portion on my Jimi Hendrix mirror. Didn't weight it but I figured 
.it in the 20 - 30 Mg range. The burn was much worse then the worst crank I had 
.ever been unfortunate enough to happen upon. Within moments I began feeling 
.the effects. Complete euphoria? I think not! In fact, the complete opposite. I 
.became very anti-social, stopped answering the phone and actually cancelled my 
.plans to go dancing that evening. I was at a complete loss for what to do with 
.myself ad either wanted the horrible feelings to end or simply fall asleep. I 
.crept in to bed and woke up the next morning with no hangover. The whole 
.experience lasted about 4 hours. ACK! 

You know, this sounds as though it might be somewhat accurate. Here's some
information on mCPP, TFMPP (mTFMPP), and other TFMPP analogs. If anything, the
information seems to indicate that on a receptor level it is somewhat similar
to LSD, but with a far, far greater potential for side effects (5HT3 is the
receptor that would be involved with nausea, I do believe) and much lower
potency. Given that LSD is, pharmalogically, just about enough antagonist to
totally block its own action (but not quite!), theres a chance that the
"ecstasy" being experienced is, in most cases, a result of the mixture of this
extremely mild serotonergic with stimulant... in most cases probably
phenylpiperazine (which Shulgin, a trusted source, confirms is indeed a
stimulant of some nature).

Frankly, it seems as though the combination of fenfluramine with a long-
lasting dopaminergic stimulant (d-amphetamine?) seems a far safer, better
traveled path towards simulating the "ecstasy" experience. I'd like to see
some reports on FenDexing, if anyone has any to offer...

BINDING OF ARYLPIPERAZINES TO 5-HT3 SEROTONIN RECEPTORS: RESULTS OF A
STRUCTURE-AFFINITY STUDY.

Eur J Pharmacol 168: 387-92 (1989)

Abstract
The binding affinities of a series of arylpiperazine derivatives at
[3H]quipazine-labeled central 5-HT3 sites were investigated. Features
determined to be important for binding include the N4 piperazine
nitrogen atom (but not the N1 piperazine nitrogen), and a quinolinyl
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
group. The quinoline nitrogen atom of quipazine also contributes to
affinity and its replacement by carbon reduces affinity by 20-fold.
The entire quinoline nucleus is not necessary for binding, and certain
monocyclic arylpiperazines, particularly those with a chloro group
meta to the position of the piperazine ring (e.g. mCPP, MK-212), also
bind at 5-HT3, sites; however, the affinities of these agents are at
least an order of magnitude less than that of quipazine itself. Taking
advantage of the fact that tertiary amines are not well tolerated at
5-HT1B sites, but that N-methyl substituents have little effect on
5-HT3 binding, we designed and synthesized a tertiary amine analog of
quipazine, i.e., N-methylquipazine (NMQ). NMQ binds at 5-HT3 sites
with an affinity similar to that of quipazine; however, unlike
quipazine, NMQ shows very little affinity (IC50 greater than 10,000
nM) for central 5-HT1B sites.

Abstract
Serotonin2A (5-HT2A) and 5-HT2C receptors share numerous
pharmacological properties. Two compounds thought to discriminate
between these two receptor subtypes are m-chlorophenypiperazine (mCPP)
and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP).

These two drugs have been classified as antagonists at 5-HT2A receptors but
as agonists at 5-HT2C receptors on the basis of phosphoinositide hydrolysis
studies in cerebral cortex and choroid plexus, respectively. To determine
more fully the properties of mCPP and TFMPP at 5-HT2A receptors, NIH 3T3
fibroblasts transfected with the 5-HT2A receptor complementary DNA (GF6
cells) were used as a model system of receptor function. These cells
express approximately 15-fold higher 5-HT2A receptor density than is found
in cerebral cortex. In GF6 cells, mCPP and TFMPP dose-dependently
stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis with maximal effects less than that
of 5-HT. This agonist activity was blocked by 5-HT2A receptor antagonists
but not by prior treatment with pertussis toxin. Partial inactivation of
5-HT2A receptors with phenoxybenzamine decreased the maximal effects of
mCPP and TFMPP but did not eliminate agonist activity. Thus mCPP and TFMPP
are partial agonists at 5-HT2A receptors in GF6 cells, and these agonist
properties are retained even under conditions where receptor density is
comparable to that of cerebral cortex. Although it has not yet been
demonstrated that mCPP and TFMPP are agonists at central 5-HT2A receptors,
this possibility should be considered when evaluating in vivo effects of
these drugs.

CALCINEURIN INHIBITS DESENSITIZATION OF CLONED RAT 5-HT1C RECEPTORS.

Sandoz Pharma Ltd, Basle, Switzerland.
Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 348: 221-4 (1993)

Abstract
Functional responses to stimulation of rat 5-HT1C receptors expressed in A9
cells were studied using whole cell voltage clamp recording technique.
Stimulation of 5-HT1C receptors with serotonin (5-HT) evoked
calcium-dependent outward currents of 109 pA in cells clamped at -50 mV.
Pretreatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristic
acetate (PMA) reduced the 5-HT-induced current amplitude by 46% of the
control value. Inclusion of inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the pipette
solution induced an outward current of 84 pA. The IP3-induced response was
not affected by 60 min pretreatment with PMA. In the presence of the PKC
antagonist calphostin C, 60 min treatment with PMA (10(-6) mol/l) reduced
the 5-HT response only by 8%. In cells preincubated with PMA, injection of
the calcium/calmodulin dependent serine proteinphosphatase calcineurin
gradually increased the 5-HT-induced responses by 34%. In A9 cells which
were incubated 24 h with the 5-HT1C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenyl-
piperazine hydrochloride (mCPP), 5-HT-induced responses were reduced by
23% of the vehicle pretreated control value. Injection of calcineurin in
mCPP treated cells enhanced the 5-HT-induced response by 24%. The results
suggest that in A9 cells rat 5-HT1C receptors are desensitized after
phosphorylation by PKC. This desensitization can be counteracted by
calcineurin-induced dephosphorylation.

Abstract
Generally, antipsychotic agents are dopamine receptor blocking agents that
also block conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) in the rat. Recently,
however, both (Q-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (OMPP, 1h) and (m-chlorophenyl)-
piperazine (MCPP, 1o) have been reported to block conditioned avoidance
responding in the rat although neither has dopamine receptor blocking
properties. The present paper examines the behavioral and biochemical
profile of a number of additional substituted phenylpiperazines. None of
the phenylpiperazines tested demonstrated high affinity for either dopamine
D-1 or D-2 receptor sites, yet many were effective in blocking CAR. The
results suggest that the phenylpiperazines may be effective antipsychotic
agents without blocking dopamine receptors. Moreover, the active compounds
did demonstrate activity in displacing ligand binding to serotonin
receptors. Receptor binding profiles were determined for 5-HT-1A and
5-HT-1B binding sites as well as for 5-HT-2 sites. The data from this
preclinical test suggest these phenylpiperazines might be effective
antipsychotic agents acting via a nondopaminergic mechanism of action.

5-HT1 AND 5-HT2 BINDING CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME QUIPAZINE ANALOGUES.
Glennon RA; Slusher RM; Lyon RA; Titeler M; McKenney JD
J Med Chem 29: 2375-80 (1986)

Abstract
Arylpiperazines, such as 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) and
its chloro analogue mCPP, are 5-HT1 agonists, whereas quipazine, i.e.,
2-(1-piperazino)quinoline, appears to be a 5-HT2 agonist. Radioligand
binding studies using rat cortical membrane homogenates and drug
discrimination studies using rats trained to discriminate a 5-HT1 agonist
(i.e., TFMPP) or a 5-HT2 agonist (i.e., 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-
2-aminopropane (DOM)) from saline reveal that quipazine and its 1-deaza
analogue 2-naphthylpiperazine (2-NP) bind at 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 sites but
produce stimulus effects similar to those of DOM. A structurally related
compound, 1-naphthylpiperazine (1-NP), possesses a high affinity for 5-HT1
(Ki = 5 nM) and 5-HT2 (Ki = 18 nM) sites. 1-NP produces stimulus effects
similar to those of TFMPP and is able to antagonize the stimulus effects
produced by DOM. The present results suggest that the unsubstituted benzene
ring of quipazine, and of its 1-deaza analogue 2-naphthylpiperazine, makes
a significant contribution to the binding of these agents to 5-HT2 sites
and, more importantly, may account for their 5-HT2 agonist properties.

And I know what I am sending here is also not like the real zip.
Theory is always dry, and this is some theory again, but fits in with
the header.

There are presently and 236 abstracts about research involving TFMPP
available on Medline,  6 of them with both keywords, TFMPP _and_
MDMA. Great place to have a look. Many thanks to Samson, for making
me aware of it. 

Here is a brief selection of articles, just to give an idea what to
expect there. I am presently quite time-pressed, so I didn't actually
select much, no time to go through the contents in detail.
Towards the end, there is a very recent article that suggests that
laboratory rats can hardly distinguish mdma from fenfluramine. I think
in some studies, not all though, that has been similar with TFMPP, the
poor little ones couldn't distinguish it well,  and that's where the
whole myth that it's an MDMA-like drug originates from. However, in
combination with an amphetamine-type compound, the similarity will
probably go up. But there seem to be differing results in some
studies,  and the whole picture is a little complicated. Didn't find
time to really have a thorough look at it. Also, my interest isn't
really that much, to be honest.

Anyway, here are the abstracts.

Title 
     Use of TFMPP stimulus properties as a model of 5-HT1B receptor
     activation.

Abstract 
     Recent evidence indicates that when
     1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) is used as a
     training drug in the drug discrimination paradigm it produces a
     stimulus effect that is site-selective at the 5-HT1B receptor.
     The present study sought to employ this procedure in order to
     assess the similarity of novel agents to TFMPP. First, rats were
     trained to reliably discriminate between the stimulus properties
     of intraperitoneally administered 1.0 mg/kg TFMPP and its
     vehicle. Following the acquisition of this discrimination,
     administration of various doses of TFMPP produced a typical
     dose-response relationship with an ED50 of 0.27 mg/kg. Rats were
     subsequently tested with another 5-HT1B specific agonist
     1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) and a 5-HT releasing agent
     norfenfluramine and both produced TFMPP-like discriminative
     responding in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the 5-HT2
     agonist 4-iodo-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) did
     not generalize from TFMPP. Other drugs, previously trained in
     other rats and shown to generalize to TFMPP, viz., ethanol,
     tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC) and
     3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) did not produce
     TFMPP-like responding. These results provide further evidence for
     the 5-HT1B receptor acting as the site for the discriminative
     effects of TFMPP. In addition, the transfer of discrimination
     between TFMPP and either ethanol, THBC or MDMA appears to be
     asymmetrical. Reasons for this one-way generalization are
     suggested.

Abstract 
     Using a standard two-lever operant procedure with rats trained to
     discriminate 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) (0.5
     mg/kg) from saline, tests of stimulus antagonism and stimulus
     generalization were performed to better understand the stimulus
     properties of this agent. The agents examined for ability to
     antagonize the TFMPP stimulus were prazosin, quipazine,
     zacopride, buspirone, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin
     (8-OH-DPAT),
     1-(2-methoxyphenol)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]-piperazine
     (NAN-190), haloperidol, and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP);
     only buspirone attenuated the response to TF-MPP. In separate
     experiments, the lowest nondisrupting dose of buspirone (1.2
     mg/kg) caused a rightward shift of the TFMPP dose-response curve
     (TFMPP alone, ED50 = 0.19 mg/kg; TFMPP + buspirone, ED50 = 0.43
     mg/kg). In addition,
     3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-on e (CP
     93, 129),
     7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)pyrolo[1,2-a]quinox
     ali ne (CGS 12066B), 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodopheny
     l)-2-aminopropane (DOI), 3-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG),
     NAN-190, nisoxetine, zacopride, 1-PP, (+)-N-allylnormetazocine
     ((+)-NANM), and
     N-methyl-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (MDMA) were
     analyzed in tests of stimulus generalization. The TFMPP stimulus
     generalized only to CGS 12066B (ED50 = 4.2 mg/kg) and (+)-NANM
     (ED50 = 8.8 mg/kg). Tests with DOI and MDMA resulted in partial
     generalization. Up to doses that disrupted behavior, all other
     agents had little effect on TFMPP-appropriate responding. The
     results of these and other published studies suggest roles for
     5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B), 5-HT1C, and, possibly,
     sigma-receptors in the mediation of the TFMPP stimulus and
     indicate a lack of involvement of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopaminergic,
     and adrenergic mechanisms in this behavior.

Abstract 
     The role of serotonin (5-HT) in the acquisition of the
     conditioned avoidance response was investigated. The effects of
     different serotonin agonists and antagonists, administered prior
     to learning sessions, were studied in groups of naive rats using
     the two-way shuttle box. Quipazine, an agonist at 5-HT1B/1C/2
     receptors, significantly increased avoidance responding in a
     dose-dependent manner (1.25-10 mg/kg, s.c.). The putative
     5-HT1B/1C receptor agonist TFMPP (1-[m-trifluoromethylphenyl]
     piperazine) at doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg (s.c.), increased
     acquisition of conditioned avoidance but showed no significant
     difference from control at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. The 5-HT1A
     agonist, buspirone, significantly decreased acquisition of
     conditioned avoidance. Increased acquisition of conditioned
     avoidance induced by either quipazine or TFMPP was effectively
     antagonized by the mixed 5-HT 1C/2 receptor antagonists,
     ketanserin (0.2 and 2 mg/kg, s.c.) and mianserin (1 mg/kg, s.c.).
     In contrast, spiperone (5-HT1A/2 receptors antagonist: 0.2 mg/kg,
     s.c.) only inhibited the increased acquisition induced by TFMPP.
     On the other hand, the 5-HT1A/1B receptors antagonist, pindolol,
     failed to antagonize the increase in acquisition of conditioned
     avoidance caused by quipazine or TFMPP. These results suggest
     that quipazine increases the conditioned avoidance behaviour by
     an action that might be mediated through stimulation of 5-HT1C
     receptors. The acquisition of conditioned avoidance induced by
     TFMPP, which was blocked by ketanserin, mianserin and spiperone
     but not by pindolol, suggests the involvement of 5-HT1C/2
     receptors in the action of TFMPP.

Abstract 
     The effect of TFMPP, an agonist of the 5-HT1b receptors, was
     studied in mice on several psychopharmacological parameters. In
     contrast to imipramine-like drugs, TFMPP neither antagonized
     reserpine-induced hypothermia nor increased yohimbine-induced
     toxicity. Similarly to imipramine-like drugs, TFMPP antagonized
     oxotremorine-induced hypothermia and was active in the
     behavioural despair test. In addition, TFMPP normalized a social
     behavioural deficit induced by isolation. The effects of TFMPP on
     oxotremorine-induced hypothermia in the behavioural despair test
     and in the isolation-induced social behavioural deficit are all
     antagonized by d-1 propranolol. It is concluded that TFMPP seems
     to possess psychotropic activity resembling only in part that of
     imipramine-like drugs and that these actions may be mediated
     through 5-HT1b receptors.

Title

Abstract 
     Male rats (N = 24) were trained to discriminate
     1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) (0.8 mg/kg) from
     saline in a two-lever, drug discrimination situation.
     5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonists such as fenfluramine (0.8-1.6
     mg/kg), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (0.1-1.6 mg/kg) and RU 24969
     (0.1-1.6 mg/kg) mimicked TFMPP;
     8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.02-0.32 mg/kg) and
     quipazine (0.2-3.2 mg/kg) elicited saline lever responding;
     d-lysergic acid diethylamide (0.1-0.16 mg/kg) produced
     intermediate results. The 5-HT antagonists BC 105 (1.6-12.8
     mg/kg), bromolysergic diethylamide (0.8-1.28 mg/kg), ketanserin
     (0.8-6.4 mg/kg), Ly 53857 (0.2-1.6 mg/kg) and pirenperone
     (0.08-0.64 mg/kg) failed to attenuate the TFMPP cue; metergoline
     (0.4-6.4 mg/kg) and spiperone (0.08-1.28 mg/kg) decreased drug
     lever responding by as much as 60%. These data suggest that 5-HT
     agonists are not identical and that drug discrimination
     procedures can differentiate among them. Given that there is
     strong evidence to support the existence of heterogeneous 5-HT
     receptors, the present results also suggest that TFMPP acts
     through mechanism(s) similar to those of the novel 5-HT1 agonists
     m-chlorophenylpiperazine and RU 24969; these actions can be
     differentiated from those underlying d-lysergic acid
     diethylamide, quipazine and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine,
     which are attenuated by putative 5-HT2 antagonists. Thus, the
     authors propose a role for 5-HT1 receptors in mediating the
     stimulus effects of TFMPP, although further research is necessary
     to identify functional antagonists of such systems.

     Rats trained to discriminate d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD;

     mg/kg) were treated with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)
     phenelzine (10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. After a 24 h "washout"
     period, they were challenged with the training drug (and dose) or
     saline, during extinction test sessions. Following 0.08 mg/kg
     LSD, LSD-trained rats responded primarily on the saline lever
     (29% drug-appropriate responding) while, after TFMPP (0.8 mg/kg),
     TFMPP-trained animals responded on the drug lever (75%
     drug-appropriate responding). These preliminary data suggest
     that, if serotonin receptors are involved in the behavioral
     effects of TFMPP, these receptors differ from those involved in
     the effects of LSD.

Abstract 
     The action of m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and
     m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), inhibiting the exploratory
     activity (ambulation and peeping) of the rat was studied in the
     open field test. The effects of both these drugs were antagonized
     by mesulergine, metergoline and mianserin, and partly by
     methysergide. Spiperone showed an antagonistic action in one
     (mean) dose only. The effects of TFMPP and m-CPP were not
     antagonized by ipsapirone, gepirone, cyanopindolol, compound
     21009, cyproheptadine, ritanserine, ICS 205930, idazoxan or
     atropine. The lesion produced by p-chloramphetamine attenuated
     the effects of TFMPP and abolished those of m-CPP. The obtained
     results permit an assumption that the TFMPP- and m-CPP-induced
     decrease in the exploratory activity is mediated probably by
     5-HT1C receptors.

Abstract 
     The piperazine-type 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonists
     1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP),
     1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (m-CPP),
     1-(p-chlorophenyl)piperazine (p-CPP) and MK-212
     [6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine], produced a dose-dependent
     suppression of spontaneous ambulatory behavior in rats.
     Pretreatment with the 5-HT antagonists metergoline, methysergide
     or mianserin, but not selective 5-HT2 or catecholamine
     antagonists, blocked the reduction of activity caused by TFMPP
     suggesting that the stimulation of 5-HT receptors was involved in
     causing this behavioral effect. Other behavioral signs of 5-HT
     receptor stimulation, such as the 5-HT behavioral syndrome or
     head-shaking behavior, were not observed in rats injected with
     TFMPP, m-CPP or MK-212 except at toxic doses. The ability of
     piperazine agonists to reduce locomotor activity in rats was
     altered by long-term changes in 5-HT neurotransmission. The
     destruction of 5-HT neurons by i.v.t. injection of the neurotoxin
     5,7-dihydroxytryptamine potentiated the ability of m-CPP to
     inhibit ambulatory behavior. On the other hand, elevating 5-HT
     content by administering the monoamine oxidase inhibitors
     phenelzine or nialamide for 7 days reduced the ability of m-CPP
     to suppress locomotor activity. Acute administration of the
     monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or chronic administration of other
     antidepressants such as desmethylimipramine or iprindole, failed
     to alter m-CPPs activity-suppressant effects. These studies
     suggest that chronic changes in 5-HT neurotransmission produce
     compensatory changes which alter the behavioral response to these
     piperazine agonists. Taken together with other evidence that both
     TFMPP and m-CPP are agonists at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, the
     effects of TFMPP and m-CPP on locomotor activity may be
     associated with the selective activation of 5-HT1C, or possibly
     5-HT1B, receptors.

Abstract 
     Using a standard two-lever drug discrimination procedure, twelve
     rats were trained to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of the serotonin
     (5-HT) agonist TFMPP from saline. Once trained, the animals
     displayed a dose-related decrease in discriminative performance
     upon administration of lower doses of TFMPP. Tests of stimulus
     generalization were performed using the purported 5-HT agonist
     RU-24, 969 and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane
     (DOM). While TFMPP produced stimulus effects similar to those of
     RU-24,969, these effects seem to be dissimilar to those of DOM.
     The results of the present study suggest that the discriminative
     stimulus effects of TFMPP may involve a 5-HT1-related mechanism.

     maximal effect was found with 0.5 mg/kg s.c. of m-CPP and with 1
     mg/kg s.c. of TFMPP. The m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and TFMPP (1
     mg/kg s.c.) responses were prevented by mianserin (0.2 mg/kg
     s.c.) and by ritanserin (1 mg/kg s.c.) given 15 min before m-CPP
     and TFMPP. In contrast, m-CPP- or TFMPP-induced penile erection
     and yawning were not antagonized by haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.)
     or by [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2,Orn8]vasotocin (5 micrograms i.c.v.).
     Apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection, but not
     yawning, was also antagonized by mianserin and less effectively
     by ritanserin. The results suggest that 5-HT1C receptor
     agonist-induced penile erection and yawning are not mediated by
     increased dopaminergic and/or oxytocinergic transmission, and
     raise the possibility that a neuronal dopamine-oxytocin-5-HT link
     is involved in the control of penile erection and not necessarily
     of yawning in male rats.

Abstract 
	This investigation evaluated the effects of the 1-arylpiperazines 
(1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine (1-NP), 1-(2-[4-aminophenyle thyl]-4-[3-trifluoro-
methylphenyl]piperazine (PAPP), 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) 
and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) on head-twitching elicited by central 
5-hydroxytryptamine2, (5-HT2) agonists and on the 5-HT motor syndrome 
associated with stimulating 5-HT1A receptors in rodents. 1-NP (0.25-16.0 
mumol/kg i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited head twitching produced by carbidopa 
(100 mumol/kg i.p.) plus 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (1000 mumol/kg i.p.) in mice. 
Pretreatment with 4 mumol/kg of 1-NP shifted the entire dose-response curve 
for head-twitching induced by quipazine (0.33-46.7 mumol/kg i.p.) to the right 
without reducing locomotor stimulation produced by quipazine (8 mumol/kg) in 
mice placed in novel photocell cages. 1-NP, PAPP, TFMPP and mCPP (8 mumol/kg) 
antagonized twitching after 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (100 mumol/kg i.p.) 
or 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan. In rats, these arylpiperazines (1-32 mumol/kg) 
dose-dependently antagonized twitching elicited by quipazine (10 mumol/kg) 
without producing correlated alterations in locomotion. 1-NP, PAPP, and mCPP 
were equipotent and 6-fold more potent than TFMPP against twitching. None of 
these arylpiperazines caused twitching. 1-NP (4 mumol/kg) also antagonized 
twitching following the direct 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-
2-aminopropane (6 mumol/kg i.p.) but not after the thyrotropin releasing

Abstract 
     Fenfluramine, a drug that induces increased synaptic serotonin,
     was used to train Fawn-Hooded rats in a drug discrimination
     paradigm. This strain of rats is thought to possess a genetic
     serotonin storage abnormality. The intent of the study was to see
     if the Fawn-Hooded rat was similar or dissimilar to the more
     frequently used strain of Sprague-Dawley rat in its ability to
     learn to discriminate 2.0 mg/kg fenfluramine administered
     intraperitoneally. In addition, drugs presumed to work upon
     central serotonergic neurons were given to the
     fenfluramine-trained Fawn-Hooded rats to investigate if the
     cueing properties of the training drug generalized to other
     agents. Results indicate that the Fawn-Hooded rats learn to
     discriminate fenfluramine from its vehicle at the same rate, and
     with a similar sensitivity to lower doses, as do the
     Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, fenfluramine was shown to
     completely generalize to MDMA (over 90%); TFMPP, m-CPP, quipazine
     and fluoxetine produced intermediate results (over 70%) and
     5-MeODMT and ibogaine were vehicle-like (less than 70%). As these
     results coincide with those previously found in Sprague-Dawley
     rats, the conclusion is that the functional capacity to
     discriminate fenfluramine appears to be like that of other rat
     lines, and serotonergically-mediated, in the Fawn-Hooded rat.
     Suggestions to explain these results are offered and discussed.

Abstract 
     A series of three experiments were conducted to investigate the
     possible serotonergic and dopaminergic mediation of the
     discriminative stimulus properties of the "designer" drug MDMA.
     In Experiment 1, rats trained to discriminate 1.5 mg/kg
     (+/-)-MDMA from its vehicle at 20 min postadministration were
     shown to generalize to another drug of abuse,
     N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) and to the
     serotonergically-active agents norfenfluramine and TFMPP. In
     contrast, testing of various dopaminergically-active agonists did
     not result in MDMA-like responding. In Experiment 2, dopaminergic
     and serotonergic antagonist were employed to observe their effect
     upon MDMA discrimination at 20 min postinjection. The serotonin
     antagonist pirenperone significantly decreased MDMA
     discrimination, whereas the dopamine decreasing drugs CGS 10746B
     and haloperidol had no effect. In Experiment 3, another group of
     rats were trained to discriminate MDMA at 105 min
     postadministration to investigate if, at this (later) time, the
     dopaminergic properties of MDMA may be more salient. Indeed, the
     dopaminergically-active drugs had a heightened effect upon MDMA
     at this later time, although the serotonergic component of the
     MDMA discriminative stimulus was predominant. The results suggest
     that the effects of MDMA at 20 min postadministration are solely
     serotonergic in nature. At 105 min postinjection there appears to
     be the presence of a weak dopaminergic component. This biphasic
     serotonergic-then-dopaminergic action of MDMA may explain the
     reported human experience with the drug, as well as the often
     controversial results in the literature.

Abstract 
     A modulatory role for serotonin has been described for the
     development and expression of the ultrasonic call of infant rat
     pups during brief maternal separations. In previous studies,
     serotonin reuptake inhibitors selectively reduced the rate of
     calling following acute administration to 9-11-day-old pups and a
     serotonin neurotoxin (MDMA) systematically disrupted the
     development of ultrasonic vocalizations but not other measures of
     motor development. In the current studies, we extended our
     investigations to include drugs with purported receptor subtype
     selectivities. Consistent with previous reports, acute
     administration of 5HT1A agonists buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT
     [+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin) reduced the rate of
     calling at doses which did not affect motor activity or core body
     temperature. The rate reducing effects of buspirone persisted up
     to 1 but not 2 h after injection. Administration of purported
     5HT1B receptor agonists, CGS12066B
     (7-trifluoromethyl-4(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo[1,2-a]
     quinoxaline) and TFMPP (1-[3-fluoromethyl)phenyl]-piperazine)
     increased the rate of calling depending on the specificity of the
     drug for the 5HT1B receptor. d,l-Propranolol, a 5HT1 receptor
     antagonist, blocked the effects of both 8-OH-DPAT and TFMPP.
     m-CPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine) and DOI
     [+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane), drugs with
     putative actions at 5HT1C and 5HT2 receptor sites both decreased
     calling but differed according to their effects on motor
     activity. Ritanserin, a 5HT2 and 5HT1C antagonist, produced a
     dose-related increase in call rate. A dose of ritanserin with no
     apparent intrinsic effects effectively antagonized DOI rate
     reducing effects but potentiated the rate reducing effects of
     m-CPP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Effects of benzylpiperazine derivatives on the acute effects of 
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in rat brain. 

Source: Neurosci Lett, 1993 Apr 2, 152:1-2, 17-20 

Abstract 
     	The reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in rat brain 3 h after 
	administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was attenuated
     	significantly by coadministration of benzylpiperazine derivatives 
	(p-nitrobenzylpiperazine, p-chlorobenzylpiperazine and 1-piperonylpiperazine), 
	which were weak inhibitors of [3H]5-HT uptake into rat brain synaptosomes. 
	However, the coadministration of desipramine and imipramine which were more 
	potent 5-HT	uptake inhibitors than these benzylpiperazines, did not attenuate 
	the reduction of 5-HT by MDMA. These results suggest that these 
	benzylpiperazines might	inhibit the acute effects of MDMA by a novel 
	neuropharmacological effect other than 5-HT uptake inhibition.

Abstract 
     	The neurotoxicity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in rat brain 
	was attenuated significantly by coadministration of several benzylpiperazines
 	(p-nitrobenzylpiperazine, p-chlorobenzylpiperazine and 1-piperonylpiperazine), 
	which were weak inhibitors for [3H]6-nitroquipazine binding to the 5-hydroxy-
	tryptamine (5-HT) transporter in rat brain. These results suggest that these 
	benzylpiperazines may inhibit the MDMA-induced neurotoxicity by a novel 
	neuropharmacological effect other than 5-HT uptake inhibition.

Comparison of serotonin agonistic and antagonistic activities of a new antidepressant 
agent Trelibet (EGYT-475) and its metabolite EGYT-2760 on isolated rat fundus. 

Source: Acta Physiol Hung, 1991, 78:3, 201-9 

Abstract 
	The effects of Trelibet (EGYT-475, N-benzyl-piperazine-picolinyl-fumarate) and 
	its active metabolite (EGYT-2760, N-benzyl-piperazine) on the serotoninergic 
	responses of rat stomach fundus were investigated and compared with those of 
	MCPP (m-chlorophenyl-piperazine) which is the common metabolite of the 
	arylpiperazine antidepressants Trazodone and Etoperidone. The contraction 
	inhibitory potencies of the agents were determined on the equipotent 
	contractions (EC50) to serotonin (5-HT) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). 
	Isotonic contractile responses to 5-HT were not affected by EGYT-475, however, 
	both EGYT-2760 and MCPP produced concentration related and reversible inhibition 
	of the serotoninergic responses. The IC50 values for EGYT-2760 and MCPP were 
	40.5 +/- 7.5 mumol/l and 125 +/- 35 nmol/l, respectively. The inhibition was 
	selective for the serotoninergic responses, as the equipotent responses to PGF2 
	alpha were not affected. EGYT-2760 and MCPP displayed not only 5-HT antagonistic, 
	but also partial agonistic activities on the rat fundus preparation. Maximum 
	contractile response of the fundus preparation to MCPP was approximately 25%, 
	to EGYT-2760 was 10% of the maximum response to 5-HT.

Synthesis and evaluation of phenyl- and benzoylpiperazines as potential serotonergics. 

Source: J Med Chem, 1986 May, 29:5, 630-4 

Abstract 
	The binding of a series of phenylpiperazines (3) and benzoylpiperazines (4) to 
	central serotonin (5-HT) sites was investigated. Several derivatives of 3 
	displayed nanomolar affinities for 5-HT1 sites, whereas derivatives of 4 were 
	essentially inactive both at 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 sites. 1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazine
	(2-MPP, 3a) was found to possess an affinity (Ki = 35 nM) for 5-HT1 sites 
	comparable to that of the recognized 5-HT agonist 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-
	piperazine (TFMPP) (Ki = 20 nM); 3a also displayed a 100-fold selectivity for 
	5-HT1 sites (as compared to 8-fold for TFMPP). In tests of stimulus 
	generalization using rats trained to discriminate TFMPP (ED50 = 0.17 mg/kg) from 
	saline, 3a was found to be nearly equipotent (ED50 = 0.22 mg/kg) with the 
	training drug. These results suggest that 3a may be a novel and more selective 
	5-HT1 agonist than TFMPP.

Dyskinetic phenomena caused by the intrastriatal injection of phenylethylamine, 
phenylpiperazine, tetrahydroisoquinoline and tetrahydronaphthalene derivatives
in the guinea pig. 

Source: Eur J Pharmacol, 1975 Mar, 31:1, 94-109 

Abstract 
	The intrastriatal injection of dopamine-like compounds in the guinea pig 
	caused the development of abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) 
	which were observed as facial grimacing, biting/gnawing/licking, severe 
	hear and neck twisting, limb movements, whole body rocking, head and neck 
	rocking and marked locomotor hyperactivity. With the exception of the 
	whole body and head and neck rocking movements the dyskinesias were 
	specifically induced by dopamine-like agents. The most conspicuous 
	dyskinesias which followed the administration of phenylethylamine 
	derivatives were the movements of biting/gnawing/licking and the 
	development of marked locomotor hyperactivity. This effect was shown to 
	be highly specific for dopamine. Tetrahydroisoquinohydroxy-1,2,3,4- 
	tetrahydronaphthalene (ADTN) caused locomotor hyperactivity and 
	gnawing/biting/licking dyskinesias. Of all compounds investigated 
	1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)pierazine (DHPP) induced the most marked 
	dyskinetic disturbances upon intrastriatal injection: intense facial 
	grimacing, biting/gnawing/licking, head and neck twisting and limb 
	movements were observed although the locomotor hyperactivity was absent. 
	Of the 1-phenylpiperazine derivatives examined, dyskinetic activity was 
	only demonstrated using compounds with a hydroxyphenyl substitution. 
	Results are discussed in terms of the structure--activity relationships 
      for the stimulation of different types of dopamine receptive structures 
	within the neostriatum.

Central serotoninmimetic action of phenylpiperazines. 

Source: Pol J Pharmacol Pharm, 1980 Jul-Aug, 32:4, 495-504 

Abstract 

	Studies of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (m-CPP), 1-(p-chlorophenyl)-
	piperazine (p-CPP) and 1-phenylpiperazine (PP) were carried out on rats, 
	mice and rabbits in order to assess their stimulatory effect on the 
	central serotonin system. It was found out that m-CPP and p-CPP evoked a 
	characteristic syndrome in the mouse behavior. All the phenylpiperazine 
	derivatives stimulated the flexor reflex in the spinal rat and evoked 
	hyperthermia in rats at a high ambient temperature (28 degrees C) and in 
	rabbits. The above effects were abolished by cyproheptadine, a drug 
	blocking the serotonin receptors. The obtained results indicate that the 
	phenylpiperazine derivatives studied have a central serotoninmimetic action.

The cardiovascular and autonomic properties of N-phenylpiperazine (NPP) 

Source: J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 1982 Oct, 223:1, 110-9 

Abstract 

	A number of isolated tissue and intact animal models were utilized to 
	investigate in more detail the cardiovascular actions of N-phenylpiperazine 
	(NPP), a known compound having adrenergic blocking properties. In isolated 
	tissues its autonomic profile is characterized by alpha and beta adrenergic 
	blocking activity. Compared to other beta receptor antagonists, NPP 
	displays moderate in vitro beta-1 blockade in guinea-pig atria. Cumulative 
	administration of NPP (0.1--0.3 mg/kg i.v.) in the intact dog also produces 
	dose-dependent inhibition of myocardial contractility following 
	isoproterenol administration. The oral antihypertensive potency of NPP in 
	the deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rat is compared with 
	phenoxybenzamine and labetalol. Its profile is similar to labetalol but
     	differs from phenoxybenzamine, causing a fall in blood pressure and a 
	decrease in heart rate. Hemodynamic data obtained with NPP in the 
	anesthetized animal reveal a complex cardiovascular profile involving the 
	interactions of the sympathetic nervous system. Canine hind limb perfusion 
	studies using cumulative doses (0.1--0.3 mg/kg i.v.) appear to preclude a 
	direct vasodilator mechanism in the reserpinized-pretreated animal. In 
	other studies, nonselective vasoconstrictor responses induced by exogenous 
	administration of norepinephrine and lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation 
	are inhibited to the same degree by NPP (0.1--10 mg/kg i.v.) autonomic 
	interactions with NPP in the nictitating membrane provide evidence for 
	inhibition of neuronal catecholamine uptake and catecholamine release. 
	From the data obtained in the present study, it is suggested that NPP has 
	a predominant influence on the response of the sympathetic nervous system 
	to provide a unique cardiovascular profile. The manner in which blood 
	pressure is regulated by either direct or nonselective mechanisms will be 
	discussed.

Meta-chlorophenylpiperazine induced changes in locomotor activity are mediated 
by 5-HT1 as well as 5-HT2C receptors in mice. 

Source: Eur J Pharmacol, 1998 Jan, 341:2-3, 135-8 

Abstract 

	1-(Meta-chloro)phenylpiperazine (m-CPP) is a 5-HT receptor agonist which 
	has been purported to be relatively selective for the 5-HT2C receptor. In
     	particular, the hypolocomotion produced by m-CPP has been suggested to be 
	mediated by 5-HT2C receptors. m-CPP binds with high affinity to 5-HT1 as
     	well as 5-HT2 receptors, thus effects of m-CPP on locomotor activity may 
	be due to the physiologic summation of the actions of m-CPP at 5-HT1 as 
	well as 5-HT2 receptors. The present study investigated the effects of 
	m-CPP alone and in the presence of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist 6-methyl-
	1-(-methyethyl)-ergoline-8beta-carboxylic acid 2-hydroxy-1-methylpropyl 
	ester maleate (LY53857), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist 
	N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl]-N-(2pyridinyl)cyclohexane-
	carboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY 100,635), and the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor
     	antagonist 2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yl)-biphenyl-
	4-carboxylic acid [4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-phenyl]amide 
	(GR 127935) on locomotor activity. Administration of m-CPP alone 
	(0.3-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-related decrease in locomotor activity. 
	The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR 127935 (3.0 mg/kg) in combination 
	with m-CPP produced a slight leftward shift of the dose-response curve of 
	m-CPP. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 (1.0 mg/kg) in 
	combination with m-CPP did not alter the m-CPP dose-response curve. The 
	non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist LY53857 (1.0 mg/kg) in combination 
	with m-CPP unmasked a hyperlocomotion produced by m-CPP. Furthermore, the 
	hyperlocomotion produced by m-CPP in the presence of LY53857 (1.0 mg/kg) 
	was blocked by both the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR 127935 
	(3.0 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 (1.0 mg/kg). 
	The present results demonstrate that the hyperlocomotion seen with the 
	combination of m-CPP and LY53857 is mediated by 5-HT1 receptors. Taken 
	together the data indicate that m-CPP affects locomotor activity by the 
	physiologic summation of agonist activity at the 5-HT2C receptor as well 
	as the 5-HT1 receptor family.

Application of a novel phenylpiperazine formation reaction to the 
radiosynthesis of a model fluorine-18-labeled radiopharmaceutical (18FTFMPP). 

Source: Nucl Med Biol, 1997 Apr, 24:3, 269-73 

Abstract 
	The labeled serotonin agonist 3-[18F]fluoro-N-(alpha,alpha,alpha-
	trifluoro-m-tolyl)piperazine (18FTFMPP) was prepared rapidly using the 
	labeling procedure for trifluorotoluenes, [18F]fluoro-for-nitro exchange, 
	followed by an alumina-supported bis-alkylation. After normal-phase HPLC 
	purification, the labeled product was obtained in 20-32% (n = 20) decay-
	corrected radiochemical yield with a radiochemical purity > 98% and a 
	specific activity of 100 GBq/mumol. The synthesis time including 
	purification was 3 h. The receptor binding affinity of FTFMPP to rat 
	brain membranes was found to be similar to that of the nonfluorinated 
	parent compound (TFMPP). Although TFMPP has been proposed by others as 
	an agent for the imaging of serotonin receptors, only minimal receptor-
	mediated uptake was observed.

Modulation of the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine: comparison 
of the effects of fluoxetine with 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists. 

Source: Neuropharmacology, 1997 Mar, 36:3, 373-81 

Abstract 
	The present investigation examined the ability of serotonin (5-HT) 
	agonists to substitute for, or alter (i.e. enhance or antagonize), the 
	discriminative stimulus properties of a moderately low dose of cocaine 
	(5 mg/kg) utilizing a two-lever, water-reinforced FR 20 drug 
	discrimination procedure in rats. In substitution tests, the 5-HT1A 
	receptor partial agonists buspirone and gepirone, the 5-HT1A/B receptor 
	agonist RU 24969 and the 5-HT1B/2C receptor agonist m-trifluoromethyl-
	phenylpiperazine (TFMPP) failed to substitute for the cocaine stimulus, 
	although RU 24969 did engender a maximum of 72% cocaine-lever 
	responding. Fluoxetine (4 mg/kg) engendered primarily saline-appropriate 
	responding. In combination tests, a fixed dose of either fluoxetine 
	(4 mg/kg), RU 24969 (0.5 mg/kg) or TFMPP (0.5 mg/kg) produced a leftward 
	shift in the cocaine dose-response curve (0.313-5 mg/kg). In contrast, 
	buspirone (2.5-20 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation 
	(approximately 60% reduction) of the cocaine stimulus. Moreover, a dose 
	of 10 mg/kg of buspirone co-administered with various doses of cocaine 
	(1.25-10 mg/kg) engendered a rightward shift in the cocaine dose-response 
	curve. Gepirone in combination with cocaine neither enhanced nor 
	antagonized the cocaine discriminative stimulus. Whereas 5-HT agonists do 
	not fully substitute for cocaine, the present results demonstrate that 
	5-HT1B, but not 5-HT1A, receptor agonists can modulate the discriminative 
	stimulus properties of cocaine in a manner similar to that observed 
	following administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. The 
	ability of buspirone, but not gepirone, to attenuate the cocaine stimulus
	probably reflects its dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonist properties and 
	not its efficacy at 5-HT1A receptors.

The influence of serotoninergic drugs on dopaminergic neurotransmission in rat 
substantia nigra, striatum and limbic forebrain in vivo. 

Source: Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol, 1992 Jul, 346:1, 12-9 

Abstract 
	The effects of serotoninergic drugs on dopaminergic neurotransmission in 
	the substantia nigra, the striatum and the limbic forebrain of rat have 
	been investigated. The accumulation of 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) following 
	inhibition of monoamine oxidase with pargyline was used as an indirect 
	measure of dopamine (DA) activity in vivo. The effects of the following 
	serotoninergic drugs were tested: the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, 
	the 5-HT1B receptor agonist trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine (TFMPP), 
	CGS 12066 B and RU 24969, the 5-HT1A/1B antagonist (+/-)pindolol, the 
	5-HT2/1C receptor antagonist ritanserin, the 5-HT2/1C receptor agonist 
	DL-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), the 5-HT3 receptor 
	antagonist BRL 43694, the unselective 5-HT receptor antagonist methiothepin, 
	and carbidopa + L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) to achieve a general, 
	unselective stimulation of multiple 5-HT receptors. In the substantia nigra, 
	carbidopa + 5-HTP treatment increased the 3-MT accumulation by 26% and 
	decreased the DA concentration to 67% of controls, tentatively suggesting a 
	5-HTP-induced displacement of nigral DA. A minor, non dose-related reduction 
	in nigral 3-MT was seen after the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. None of 
	the other serotonin receptor acting drugs induced any pronounced effect on 
	the nigral 3-MT accumulation. Taken together, the findings provide little 
	support for the idea that one single 5-HT receptor subtype serves a 
	modulatory function on DA activity in the substantia nigra. In the striatum 
	and the limbic forebrain, trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine dose-dependently 
	increased the 3-MT accumulation to maximally 200%-220% of controls.

Source: J Med Chem, 1991 Dec, 34:12, 3360-5 

Abstract 
	Sigma receptors may represent an exciting new approach for the development 
	of novel psychotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, many of the commonly 
	used sigma ligands lack selectivity (e.g., many bind at phencyclidine or 
	dopamine receptors) or suffer from other serious drawbacks. Recently, we 
	described a series of 2-phenylaminoethanes that bind at sigma receptors 
	with high affinity and selectivity. Because there is evidence that 
	1-phenylpiperazines can structurally mimic the 2-phenylaminoethane moiety, 
	we prepared a series of 1-phenylpiperazines and related analogues and 
	incorporated structural features already shown to enhance the sigma 
	binding of the 2-phenylaminoethanes. Several of these derivatives bind at 
	sigma receptors with high affinity (Ki = 1-10 nM) and lack appreciable 
	affinity for phencyclidine and dopamine receptors. In as much as certain 
	of these agents structurally resemble the high-affinity, but nonselective,
     	sigma ligand haloperidol, and because they bind with 10 times the affinity 
	of haloperidol, we have apparently identified what appears to be the 
	primary sigma pharmacophore of that agent.

5-HT1A receptor blockade increases penile erections induced by 5-HT agonists. 

Source: Neuroreport, 1993 Dec 13, 5:3, 229-30 

Abstract 

	Indirect serotonergic agonists, whether promoters of 5-HT release such as 
	fenfluramine (5 mg kg-1) or inhibitors of 5-HT uptake such as fluoxetine 
	(10 mg kg-1), elicited in rats penile erections at a modest but significant 
	level. Their effects were markedly potentiated by the beta-blocker 
	tertatolol, (0.6-5 mg kg-1) which displays 5-HT1A receptor blocking 
	activity, but not by the beta-blocker labetalol (6.25 and 25 mg kg-1), 
	which lacks such activity. In addition, tertatolol, but not labetalol, 
	potentiated penile erections induced by meta-chloro-phenylpiperazine 
	(1 mg kg-1). Thus, it appears that increasing serotonergic transmission 
	increases only moderately penile erections because of the functional 
	opposition exerted by 5-HT1A (inhibition) and 5-HT1C (activation) 
	serotonin receptors on this response.

Activity of aromatic substituted phenylpiperazines lacking affinity for 
dopamine binding sites in a preclinical test of antipsychotic efficacy. 
 
Source: J Med Chem, 1989 May, 32:5, 1052-6 

Abstract 
	Generally, antipsychotic agents are dopamine receptor blocking agents 
	that also block conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) in the rat. 
	Recently, however, both (Q-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (OMPP, 1h) and 
	(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (MCPP, 1o) have been reported to block 
	conditioned avoidance responding in the rat although neither has dopamine 
	receptor blocking properties. The present paper examines the behavioral 
	and biochemical profile of a number of additional substituted 
	phenylpiperazines. None of the phenylpiperazines tested demonstrated high 
	affinity for either dopamine D-1 or D-2 receptor sites, yet many were 
	effective in blocking CAR. The results suggest that the phenylpiperazines 
	may be effective antipsychotic agents without blocking dopamine receptors. 
	Moreover, the active compounds did demonstrate activity in displacing 
	ligand binding to serotonin receptors. Receptor binding profiles were
	determined for 5-HT-1A and 5-HT-1B binding sites as well as for 5-HT-2 
	sites. The data from this preclinical test suggest these phenylpiperazines 
	might be effective antipsychotic agents acting via a nondopaminergic 
	mechanism of action.

Block of conditioned avoidance responding in the rat by phenylpiperazines. 

Source: Eur J Pharmacol, 1988 Nov 1, 156:2, 223-9 

Abstract 
	Ortho-methoxyphenylpiperazine (OMPP) and meta-substituted chlorophenyl-
	piperazine (MCPP) blocked conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) in the 
	rat (ED50 values = 5.6 (4.6, 7.3) and 2.4 (1.9, 2.9) mg/kg i.p. (95% 
	confidence limits), respectively) without markedly altering escape 
	responding. Since this test predicts antipsychotic efficacy, the 
	piperazines were examined in radioligand binding assays and found to have 
	no affinity for dopamine (DA) binding sites, but were active at serotonin 
	binding sites. OMPP displaced ligands for the 5-HT1A binding site with 
	high affinity (Ki = 9.5 (5.4, 17.9) nM) but was inactive at 5-HT2 sites 
	(Ki greater than 1000 nM). MCPP, on the other hand, displaced ligands for 
	5-HT1, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 binding sites with similar potencies (Ki values = 
	25 (3, 67), 23 (14, 40) and 40 (33, 48) nM, respectively). Pretreatment 
	with metergoline (1.0 mg/kg i.p. -30 min) reduced MCPP- but not OMPP-
	induced block of CAR. OMPP, on the other hand, acted as a DA receptor 
	antagonist in vivo blocking amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior,
	whereas MCPP did not. Neither produced catalepsy even given in doses 8-10 
	times those required to block CAR. Insofar as these compounds lack 
	antidopaminergic activity in vivo, yet are active in a test (CAR) 
	predictive of antipsychotic activity in which DA receptor antagonists are 
	active, they may be novel antipsychotic agents, or, perhaps, false 
	positives in the CAR paradigm.

Agonist/antagonist activities of arylpiperazines at human platelet 5HT2 receptors. 

Source: J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 1988 Dec, 247:3, 965-70 

Abstract 

	A series of arylpiperazines was examined for structure-function 
	relationships at the human platelet serotonin (5-HT) receptor. Amplification 
	of ADP-induced aggregation was used to measure 5-HT receptor activation. The 
	platelet serotonergic agonists 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane 
	(DOI), 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT) and the antagonist ketanserin 
	were used for comparison of potency and amplitude of response. 
	All arylpiperazines, including the parent compound phenylpiperazine (PP) 
	showed antagonist activity. The monosubstituted phenylpiperazines acted only 
	as antagonists, and electron-withdrawing substituents markedly enhanced 
	activity. Modification of PP by addition of another phenyl ring or 
	benz-fusion also enhanced antagonist activity. Benz-fusion at the b face of 
	PP (1-NP) yielded greater antagonist potency than benz-fusion at the c face 
	(2-NP). The latter modification, however, also conferred a variable agonist 
	activity with a very weak response. In contrast, the heteroaromatic 
	piperazines consistently demonstrated concentration dependent mixed 
	antagonist-agonist activity. These compounds were weak agonists compared 
	with 5-HT, 5-MeOT and DOI, although the amplitude of the quipazine response 
	was similar to DOI. This study demonstrates that the arylpiperazines, which 
	are variably selective for the multiple brain 5-HT receptors, are all 
	antagonists on the platelet 5-HT receptor. The antagonist activity is 
	markedly increased by ring monosubstitution or aryl modification. Compared 
	with the monosubstituted analogues, antagonist activity is decreased by 
	heteroaromatic modification or by the addition of an N-aminophenethyl group 
	to the 4-position nitrogen. Weak agonist activity can be conferred by 
	heteroaromatic modification.

Effects of fenfluramine, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, and other serotonin-
related agonists and antagonists on penile erections in nonhuman primates. 

Source: Life Sci, 1988, 43:16, 1297-303 

Abstract 

Fenfluramine, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), 1-phenylpiperazine, and the
buspirone metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine given intravenously to
adult rhesus monkeys regularly elicited penile erections. In contrast, 
serotonin (5-HT) agonists with 5-HT1A site specificity (8-OH-DPAT,
buspirone) as well as trazodone, ritanserin, and metergoline were no
different from saline in producing penile erections. Fenfluramine's effects
were blocked by the 5-HT2 antagonists, ritanserin and metergoline, while
m-CPP's effects were not blocked by the peripheral 5-HT antagonist, 
xylamidine, indicating that tumescence can  be elicited by serotonergic
agents which act at non-5-HT1A sites in the central nervous system.

Behavioral tolerance to one effect of the serotonergic agonist TFMPP. 

Source: Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 1992 May, 16:3, 361-8 

Abstract 

1. In mice isolated for one week and observed in pairs with non-isolated
   mice under a reversed beaker, the serotonergic agonist: 1-3-(trifluoro-
   methyl)phenylpiperazine (TFMPP) increased the number of escape attempts.
2. A partial tolerance to this effect has been observed in mice which
   were tested a first time after administration of TFMPP one week sooner.
3. An analysis of this form of tolerance was carried out by changing success-
   ively and separately each of the events concomitant of this tolerance.
4. The results show that this tolerance is not a pharmacocinetic or a
   pharmacodynamic one. Observation of the tolerance required the performance
   of the first test in a drug state. The more likely explanation is that this
   tolerance results from a conditioned opponent response.

Biotransformation study of para-substituted phenylpiperazines in beagle 
dogs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 

Source: Xenobiotica, 1991 Oct, 21:10, 1371-84 

Abstract 

1. Beagle dogs were treated orally (10 mg/kg) with para-chloro-, para-fluoro-
   and para-methyl-phenylpiperazine derivatives, and urine was collected for
   72 h after treatment.
2. Metabolites were extracted, converted into trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives
   and examined by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry.
3. The metabolites fall into two main groups, N-desphenylated metabolites,
   which result from N-desphenylation, and N-phenyl metabolites.
4. Two kinds of hydroxylated metabolites were found. Some lost the original
   para substituent (Cl, F or CH3); others retained it.
5. These results are consistent with the NIH shift reaction.

5-HT-1a and 5-HT-1b selectivity of two phenylpiperazine derivatives: 
evidence for 5-HT-1b heterogeneity. 

Source: Life Sci, 1985 Apr 1, 36:13, 1265-73 

Abstract 
     	The ability of m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and an 
	N-substituted derivative, LY 165163 (p-NH2-PE-TFMPP), to discriminate 
	5-HT-1 binding sites labelled by [3H]5-HT is compared in rat corpus 
	striatum and rat cortex. TFMPP displays at least a 30 fold selectivity 
	for the 5-HT-1b subtype. Furthermore, TFMPP reveals heterogeneity within 
	the 5-HT-1b binding sites. TFMPP displays a Kd of 6 nM for approximately 
	two-thirds of the 5-HT-1b binding sites and a Kd of 273 nM for the 
	remaining one third of the 5-HT-1b sites. p-NH2-PE-TFMPP, on the other 
	hand, discriminates the 5-HT-1 sites in a manner similar to spiperone, 
	displaying a 110 fold selectivity for the 5-HT-1a sites. p-NH2-PE-TFMPP 
	displays a Kd of about 3 nM for the 5-HT-1a sites. p-NH2-PE-TFMPP does 
	not discriminate subtypes within the 5-HT-1b binding sites. The 
	significance of the selectivity of these two compounds as well as
	structurally related compounds is discussed.

Discriminative stimulus properties of the serotonin agonist 
1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP). 

Source: Life Sci, 1984 Oct 1, 35:14, 1475-80 

Abstract 

	Using a standard two-lever drug discrimination procedure, twelve rats 
	were trained to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of the serotonin (5-HT) agonist 
	TFMPP from saline. Once trained, the animals displayed a dose-related 
	decrease in discriminative performance upon administration of lower 
	doses of TFMPP. Tests of stimulus generalization were performed using
     	the purported 5-HT agonist RU-24, 969 and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-
	phenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOM). While TFMPP produced stimulus effects 
	similar to those of RU-24,969, these effects seem to be dissimilar to 
	those of DOM. The results of the present study suggest that the 
	discriminative stimulus effects of TFMPP may involve a 5-HT1-related 
	mechanism.

Effects of repeated administration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor 
phenelzine on the discriminability of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 
and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (TFMPP). 

Source: Psychopharmacology (Berl), 1986, 89:1, 134-5 

Abstract 

Rats trained to discriminate d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.08 mg/kg)
or 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (TFMPP; 0.8 mg/kg) were treated
with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine (10 mg/kg/day) for 7
days. After a 24 h "washout" period, they were challenged with the training
drug (and dose) or saline, during extinction test sessions. Following 0.08
mg/kg LSD, LSD-trained rats responded primarily on the saline lever (29%
drug-appropriate responding) while, after TFMPP (0.8 mg/kg), TFMPP-trained
animals responded on the drug lever (75% drug-appropriate responding).
These preliminary data suggest that, if serotonin receptors are involved in
the behavioral effects of TFMPP, these receptors differ from those involved
in the effects of LSD.

TFMPP may produce its stimulus effects via a 5-HT1B mechanism. 

Source: Pharmacol Biochem Behav, 1986 Jan, 24:1, 43-7

Abstract 

Tests of stimulus generalization were conducted using rats trained to
discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of 1-(3-trifluoromethylphen yl)piperazine (TFMPP)
from saline in a standard two-lever operant procedure. Generalization of
the TFMPP-stimulus was found to occur with fenfluramine and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-
piperazine (mCPP); generalization did not occur with 8-OH DPAT, quipazine,
LSD, 5-OMe DMT or 2,5-DMA. Furthermore, the TFMPP-stimulus was not
antagonized by pretreatment of the animals with tetrahydrotrazodone (THT).
Based on the results of these studies, and on the results of previous
binding studies with these same agents, it is suggested that the stimulus
properties of TFMPP are mediated primarily via a 5-HT1B mechanism

Anxiogenic-like effects of mCPP and TFMPP in animal models are opposed
by 5-HT1C receptor antagonists. 

Source: Eur J Pharmacol, 1989 May 30, 164:3, 445-54

Abstract 

1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) and 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-
piperazine (TFMPP) (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) reduce total interaction time in a rat
social interaction test under low light familiar conditions and its
following components; grooming, following, crawling over, fighting,
sniffing. Locomotion was only reduced by the highest dose of mCPP. mCPP
also reduced activity in the light but not total locomotion in a light/dark
transition test. These results suggest that mCPP (and TFMPP) are anxiogenic
but not sedative in these tests. The effect of mCPP on social interaction
was blocked by three antagonists which share a high affinity for 5-HT1C and
5-HT2 receptors: mianserin, cyproheptadine and metergoline but not by the
5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin or ritanserin or the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B
antagonists cyanopindolol and (-)-propranolol. It was prevented by a low
(0.05 mg/kg) but not by a high (1.0 mg/kg) dose of ICS 205,930 a specific
5-HT3 antagonist reported to be anxiolytic at low doses. It was also
prevented by chronic pretreatment with the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide.
These results argue for an anxiogenic action of mCPP mediated by 5-HT1C
receptors. Since the chronic chlordiazepoxide pretreatment did not prevent
the hypolocomotion or hypophagia induced by mCPP at high dosage (5 mg/kg)
these latter effects are unlikely to be secondary to anxiety.

Discriminative stimulus properties of m-chlorophenylpiperazine.

Source: Pharmacol Biochem Behav, 1993 May, 45:1, 221-3

Abstract 

Stimulus control was established in a group of 10 rats using a dose of
m-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP) of 0.8 mg/kg, administered IP, 15 min
before training. A two-lever operant task using a fixed-ratio 10 schedule
of sweetened milk reinforcement was used. Based upon a criterion for the
presence of stimulus control of five consecutive sessions during which 83%
or more of all responses were on the appropriate lever, a mean of 27
sessions was required to reach criterion performance. Response rates were
significantly suppressed by the training dose of MCPP (14 responses/min) as
compared with saline sessions (38 responses/min). Subsequent to the
establishment of stimulus control, tests of generalization were conducted
with m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperaz ine (TFMPP), 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-
pyrazine (MK-212), and 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole
(RU-24969). MCPP generalized completely to MK-212 and TFMPP at doses of the
latter drugs of 0.7 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Maximum generalization to
RU-24969 was 67% at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg but only 4 of 10 subjects completed
the test session. The present results indicate that MCPP is efficacious as
a discriminative stimulus. In addition, because of MCPP's relative selectivity
for the 5-hydroxytryptamine c(5-HT1C) receptor subjects trained with MCPP
may prove valuable in assessing the respective functional contributions of
5-HT1C sites to the actions of a variety of serotonergic agents.
