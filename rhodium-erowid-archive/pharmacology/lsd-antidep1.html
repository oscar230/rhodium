<p><b>I posted this article to Usenet in May 1994. Over the years I have received the anecdotal responses that follow. 
If you have something to add, please write to me. <br><i>-- Mike Brown</i> &lt;mike@hyperreal.org&gt;</b></p>

<p>
&gt; I have a friend who is bipolar and is taking Lithium to control<br>
&gt; her chemical imbalance. I've been telling her about my positive<br>
&gt; experiences with LSD and she is interested in trying it.
</p>

<p>
&gt; I checked the FTP sites and I don't recall seeing this being discussed<br>
&gt; here before, but I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Can someone post or email me with any information they have concerning<br>
&gt; the interaction of LSD with Lithium?  Surely there are some bipolar<br>
&gt; folks on the net who have tripped before. Is it too risky?  What are<br>
&gt; the dangers?  What advice can you offer?<br>
</p>

<h4>---1st response---</h4>

<p>
Not advisable. Potentially very dangerous.
</p>

<p>
If your friend is planning to do this, then she MUST research LSD
intensively before taking it...and get a good understanding of exactly
what risks she will be taking.
</p>

<p>
LSD has been known to 'trigger' latent mental illnesses - it doesn't
cause them, but it can exacerbate the condition - even if the person
doesn't yet know that they have any 'condition'. This is probably where
the myth that "lsd can make you crazy" originally came from.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, hallucinogens can cause a profound change in
outlook...enough to lift a severe depression - I know that this can
happen because it happened to me when I was around 22 - I'm 27 now. I
attribute my current mental health, and even my continued existence, to
a batch of mushrooms I took when I was suicidally depressed - turned my
head around completely, and within a few weeks I was well on the road
to recovery. It wasn't an instantaneous, magic cure but it provided
the impetus that I needed to get started. I would probably have
topped myself within a few months otherwise - suicide was constantly
on my mind, and I was evaluating different methods trying to come to a
decision...no way to be sure, but I expect that I would be dead by now
if it weren't for that mushroom trip.
</p>

<p>
So, tell your friend to BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. LSD could teach her
something, or it could send her into a downward spiral.
</p>

<h4>---2nd response---</h4>

<p>
I'm not sure if there are any known harmful interactions between LSD and
Lithium. In fact, I don't think anyone is _sure_ why Lithium is effective
in stopping bipolar cycles.
</p>

<p>
However, I am SURE that LSD is not something that should be introduced to
anyone with manic-depressive disorder. My girlfriend is also bipolar, and
LSD will cause a triggering effect in her that sends her straight into
mania, almost immediately. All it took was one trip.  She
had gone without an episode for more than 5 years until she decided to dose
one day. Can you imagine how unpleasant that must feel?  Full blown mania
PLUS an acid trip (which would probably become a bad trip.)
</p>

<p>
I hate to be one of those types that perpetuates these drug horror stories,
but it's just not a good idea for anyone who has a clinical disorder to take
mood altering drugs. Clara actually had to drop out of school that semester
and seek treatment at a hospital she ended up staying at for six weeks.
Mind you, she wasn't being treated for "Post LSD psychosis" ( a condition 
which is a complete myth in my opinion.) but for the mania which the LSD
catalyzed.
</p>

<p>
I've also had positive experiences with LSD, so I have no bias against it.
But please don't let your friend take it!  If you do decide to 
do it, keep a close eye on her! (as if you wouldn't :) )
</p>

<h4>---3rd response---</h4>

<p>
I've never heard of this exact situation before, but it seems like it Might
be dangerous to me.. Lithium, as  I understand it is used to stabilize a
person's personality, to lop off the manic and the depressive parts , and
leave the person more level.. but LSD can really send a person reeling in
either direction quite quickly.. I wouldn't recommend that anyone with
mental problems severe enough to me medicated in the long term try LSD...
</p>

<h4>---4th response---</h4>

<p>
Generally I lurk here in alt.drugs for lack of pertinent info, but here I must
comment... I was diagnosed manic-depressive in March, and was put on lithium
soon after. Contrary to popular belief, being manic-depressive is not an "I'm
so out of control everyday" sort of problem. It comes and it goes, many people
go years without a significant episode of mania or depression.
</p>

<p>
I have combined my lithium with LSD and had no problems. The only effect I
noticed at all with a slight increase in my tolerance of LSD (previously I had
very little - when friends dropped 2 tabs, I dropped 1, etc.). The LSD didn't
swing me into a mania or depression.
</p>

<p>
However, this is my experience. In the drug books I've read, the warning with
mixing lithium with pot or LSD is "possible psychosis". although no one in any
manic-depressive support group or online group I've talked to has experienced
such.
</p>

<p>
Just a little slice o' my life
</p>

<h4>---5th response---</h4>

<p>
I knew a guy last year, and I started hanging out with him. I soon relized
that he was heavily into drugs. He took several prescriptions, including
lithium, and I know he had dropped LSD many of times. Ever since Ive known
him hes seemed kinda "not all there", and the longer i knew him the worse
it got. About 2 months ago he was put in a "half-way" house. His mother
did not think he could take care of himself. I personally think he is gone
insane due to taking to many drugs. I just thought I would write and give
you my opionion.
</p>

<h4>---6th response---</h4>

<p>
I am bi-polar manic depressive. I have been so all my life, but 
have only recently been diagnosed. The doc recommended I take Depekote 
instead of Lithium. I have also taken 380 doses of LSD in 4 years, which 
is not counting the acid parties I attended before that. So far there 
have been no adverse side effects, only positive effects(i.e., higher 
I.Q., better grades and a new awareness of my conscious self). I cannot 
offer any info on Lithium and LSD interactions, but advocate the use and 
further study of LSD. Then again, I may be just an exceptional case.
</p>

<h4>---7th response---</h4>

<p>
I have been taking lithium for almost one year now. I started
last October after I experienced my first (and only to date) manic episode
of my life and was hospitalized. I had tripped four times before the
episode, all within a year of the episode. I have also tripped twice
since then, once in May and again in July. I did take smaller doses the
past two times, half a hit and three quarters respectively, but I would
say it was quite potent acid since I tripped for around 10 hours both
times. Also, all six of my experiences with LSD have been positive,
especially the last two. I am very interested to hear any information you
have or any experiences your girlfriend has had. I found the homepage
because I am planning to trip again in a month or two with my yoga teacher
in a retreat-like setting which I have never done before. I would write
more, but I have to go. I would like to finish with my opinion that both
LSD and manic-depression are EXTREMELY profound and powerful experiences
and I treat both with the respect that they deserve and I recommend that
you and your girlfriend do the same.
</p>

<h4>---8th response---</h4>

<p>I would like to add this to the text on LSD and lithium interactions.</p>

antidepressants attenuates the subjective effects of LSD in humans.</a>
<p><b>Article Source:</b> Neuropsychopharmacology 1996 Jun;14(6):425-36
<p><b>Author(s):</b> Bonson KR; Buckholtz JW; Murphy DL 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This study investigates the possible interactions of
antidepressant agents and hallucinogens in humans through structured
interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Volunteer subjects
recruited through announcements placed on the Internet or other sources
were asked to describe the somatic, hallucinatory, and psychological
effects of self-administered LSD prior to and during chronic
administration of an antidepressant. Twenty-eight out of 32 subjects (88%)
who had taken an antidepressant with inhibitory effects on serotonin
(5-HT) reuptake (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone) for over 3
weeks had a subjective decrease or virtual elimination of their responses
to LSD. An additional subject who had taken fluoxetine for only 1 week had
an increased response to LSD. These data are in contrast to our previous
study that reported increased responses to LSD during chronic
administration of tricyclic antidepressants or lithium. Possible
mechanisms of action for the effects from serotonergic antidepressants
involve 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors, changes in extracellular brain
serotonin concentrations, and changes in brain catecholamine systems.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Bonson KR; Murphy DL 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This study sought to investigate possible interactions
between antidepressant agents and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in
humans through the use of retrospective questionnaires. Ten subjects were
identified who used LSD during chronic (3 weeks or longer) periods of
antidepressant administration. These subjects were asked to describe the
phenomenological effects of self-administered hallucinogens prior to and
during antidepressant treatment; a structured, standardized questionnaire
was used to evaluate LSD experiences. Chronic tricyclic antidepressant
administration was associated with subjective increases in physical,
hallucinatory and psychological responses to LSD. Similarly, subjects
receiving lithium chronically also reported increases in their responses
to LSD. In contrast, subjects who had been chronically taking an monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitor reported subjective decreases in the effects of
LSD. This is similar to a previous report by our group of a decreased
response to LSD in individuals who were chronically taking
serotonin-selective antidepressants. These altered responses to LSD most
likely involve differential changes in central serotonin and dopamine
receptor systems and are consistent with other recent data suggesting that
the clinical efficacy of different classes of antidepressants may not
necessarily rely on a common mechanism of action in the brain.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Trazodone, an antidepressant drug with an unknown
mechanism of action, has been examined in order to demonstrate its central
antiserotonin action. Trazodone antagonizes the head twitch response
induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan in rats and mice, or by-5-methoxytryptamine
in rats (the ED50 values are 9.3, 5.2, and 10.8 mg/kg respectively). It
counteracts convulsions induced by tryptamine in rats (ED50=3.75 mg/kg).
Trazodone abolishes hyperthermia induced by serotoninomimetics (LSD,
quipazine, fenfluramine) in rabbits. It does not affect ptosis induced by
reserpine, and diminishes stimulation of the locomotor activity induced by
amphetamine. Our findings demonstrate that trazodone has a central
antiserotonin action, similarly as three other antidepressant drugs:
mianserin, danitracen and doxepin, whose central antiserotonin action has
been found previously.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> The antidepressant drug-Doxepin (DX) was examined in
order to investigate its central antiserotonin activity. The drug
antagonized the behavioral syndrome elecited by L-5-hydroxytryptophan in
rats and mice, but did not affect the pinna reflex. In the flexor reflex
preparation, DX acted like other sero-tonin receptor blockers: By itself,
it had no influence on the flexor reflex but it prevented the potentiation
induced by serotonergic agents (fenfluramine, LDS, mescaline). The
hyperthermia provoked by serotonergic agent (fenfluramine, LSD)in rabbits
was antagonized by DX. DX abolished the syndrome induced by oxotremorine.
The results obtained indicate that DX blocks central 5-HT receptors, like
the two other antidepressants, mianserin and danitracen.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Blier P; de Montigny C 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
drugs has been shown to enhance the responsiveness of rat forebrain
neurons to serotonin (5-HT). In the present study, imipramine (5 mg and 10
mg/kg), iprindole (2.5 mg/kg), desipramine and femoxetine (5 mg/kg) were
administered daily for 14 days. The response of dorsal raphe neurons to
intravenous injection of LSD (4 microgram/kg) and to microiontophoretic
applications of 5-HT and LSD was assessed 24 h after the last dose. The
responsiveness to intravenous LSD and the effectiveness of
microiontophoretic applications of 5-HT and LSD were not altered by TCA
drug pretreatments. Furthermore, the treatments did not change the mean
firing rate of these 5-HT neurons. Those results suggest that chronic
treatment with TCA drugs does not alter the sensitivity of the 5-HT
autoreceptor. Thus, the effect of the previously reported increase of
postsynaptic neuron responsiveness to 5-HT would not be dampened by a
decreased activity of the presynaptic neurons.

potentiated apomorphine hypermotility in rats.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Gold R; Morgenstern R; Fink H 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The model of LSD potentiated apomorphine hypermotility
[5] was used to classify different atypical antidepressants (danitracen,
mianserin, cyproheptadine) and pizotifen. All drugs have been shown to
inhibit specifically the locomotor activity potentiating effect of LSD in
a low dosage range (0.1-0.5 mg/kg i. p.) without influencing the
apomorphine effect. Since there is some evidence that the effect of LSD is
due to the inhibition of the activity of serotonergic raphe neurons, the
marked antagonizing effects of danitracen, mainserin, cyproheptadine and
pizotifen are regarded to be an expression of pronounced antiserotonin
activity.

<p><b>Article Source:</b> Psychopharmacology (Berl) 1997 Sep;133(1):39-42
<p><b>Author(s):</b> Spigset O; Mjorndal T 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Alterations in platelet 5-HT2A receptor
characteristics have been reported in major depression as well as in other
psychiatric diseases, and some effort has been made to utilize platelet
5-HT2A receptor status as a biological correlate to antidepressant drug
response. In order to investigate whether treatment with a selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor affects platelet 5-HT2A receptors, we have
studied platelet [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide ([3H]LSD) binding in
healthy subjects treated with fluvoxamine in increasing dosage once weekly
for 4 weeks. After 1 week of fluvoxamine treatment (25 mg/day), both Bmax
and Kd were significantly lower than before the start of the treatment
(19.9 versus 25.5 fmol/mg protein, P = 0.005 for Bmax; 0.45 versus 0.93
nM, P = 0.006 for Kd). Bmax returned to baseline during week 2, whereas Kd
was lower than the baseline value throughout the treatment period. After
discontinuation of fluvoxamine treatment, there was a significant increase
in Kd (0.50 nM before discontinuation vs. 1.14 nM after discontinuation; P
= 0.001), but not in Bmax. The study demonstrates that fluvoxamine affects
platelet 5-HT2A receptor status irrespective of underlying psychiatric
disease, and that this effect is evident already after 1 week at a
subtherapeutic fluvoxamine dose.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Schreiber W; Opper C; Dickhaus B; Heiser P; Wesemann
W; Krieg JC 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Sleep deprivation (SD) is an effective, however
short-lived, method of treatment of depression. Preliminary findings
suggest that the antidepressive effect of sleep deprivation is mediated by
serotoninergic (5-HT) mechanisms. We therefore assessed serotoninergic
activity before and after total SD (TSD) as well as after the following
night sleep by investigating platelet LSD-binding, MAO B-activity, and
5-HT-content as well as plasma norepinephnne (NE) in 10 healthy men (age:
27.4 +/- 2.8 years). Blood samples were drawn on three consecutive days at
0700, 1300 and 1900 h, respectively. After TSD, a significant increase of
LSD-binding KD and Bmax as well as of MAO-B KM and plasma NE could be
observed, which, however, vanished after consecutive night sleep. Our
findings favour an increased serotoninergic transmission after TSD and
thus support the hypothesis, that sleep deprivation exerts its
antidepressant effects by pro-serotoninergic mechanisms.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Grahame-Smith DG; Geaney DP; Schachter M; Elliott JM 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic treatment with phenothiazines and
thioxanthenes has been found to enhance 5-HT-induced aggregation of human
platelets. A method has been developed to study 5-HT2 receptor binding
sites on platelets utilising [3H]-LSD and more recently 125I/LSD. Results
are presented which suggest that the LSD binding site is indeed the 5-HT2
binding site and that the LSD binding characterises the specific receptor
responsible for 5-HT-induced shape change and aggregation. In a group of
patients receiving phenothiazines or thioxanthenes, the Bmax of LSD
binding was increased. The mean binding affinity was decreased possibly
due to a persistence of neuroleptic in the platelet membrane preparation.
Analysis showed that this was not the reason why the mean binding capacity
was increased. The results show that chronic phenothiazine and
thioxanthene delta treatment 'up-regulates' platelet 5-HT2 binding sites
and that this may be accompanied by increased sensitivity to platelet
aggregation by 5-HT. In normal subjects desipramine treatment increased
the Bmax of platelet LSD binding and this was accompanied by an increased
prolactin response to tryptophan which is thought to be mediated by
central 5-HT function.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Radioligand receptor binding techniques were used to
characterize the effects of different structural types of antidepressant
drugs on neurotransmitter receptors. The tricyclic antidepressants more or
less potently inhibited the binding to rat brain preparations of several
different radiolabelled ligands [3H]WB4101, [3H]QNB, [3H]-d-LSD,
[3H]mepyramine). The potency of the nontricyclic antidepressants varied
greatly. Mianserin, potently displaced [3H]mepyramine, [3H]d-LSD and
[3H]WB4101 while it was very weak on [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB-binding. Nomifensine and the
specific 5-HT uptake inhibitors zimelidine and alaproclate had very low
affinity for these receptors. All the antidepressants tested were
practically devoid of activity on [3H]DHA binding, [3H]spiroperidol
binding, [<sup>3</sup>H]flunitrazepam binding, [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding and [3H]naloxone
binding. The implications of these findings for biogenic amine theories of
affective disorders are discussed.

<p><b>Author(s):</b> Ogren SO; Fuxe K; Agnati LF; Gustafsson JA; Jonsson
G; Holm AC 
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The effects of antidepressant drugs on central 5-HT
receptor activity were studied in rats and mice. Antidepressant drugs were
evaluated for their ability to displace 3H-5-HT and 3H-d-LSD from membrane
binding sites in the dorsal neocortex of rats in vitro and for their
ability to block 5-HTP and d-LSD induced behavioral effects in mice. The
degree of blockade of head-twitches in mice produced by the
antidepressants was highly correlated with their affinity for 3H-d-LSD
binding sites. A number of antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline,
nortriptyline, mianserine, doxepine, nomifensine and dibenzepine appear to
possess marked 5-HT receptor blocking activity at some type of 5-HT
receptors in brain. New antidepressant drugs such as zimelidine, which
specifically inhibit 5-HT reuptake and do not block 5-HT receptor sites,
may after chronic treatment also reduce the functional activity of 5-HT
systems by producing adaptive changes in postsynaptic 5-HT mechanisms.
Thus, a new indoleamine hypothesis of depression is presented: the
therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs may in part be due to a reduced
functional acitivity of some central 5-HT systems.
