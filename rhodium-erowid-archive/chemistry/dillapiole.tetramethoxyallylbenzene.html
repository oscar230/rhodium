<p>A convenient method for the preparation of 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzene (<strong>I</strong>) in quantity has now been
found in the oxidation of the accessible gallacetophenone 3,4-dimethyl ether with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
in alkaline solution, and it has been used in the synthesis of dill-apiole in the following manner. Treatment
with allyl bromide in acetone in presence of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> yielded a monallyl ether, which
underwent molecular rearrangement on heating with production of 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyallylbenzene (<strong>II</strong>)
(uncharacterised) as the chief product. Since migration of an allyl group under these conditions always yields
an <i>o-</i> or a <i>p-</i>hydroxyallylbenzene, the production of (<strong>II</strong>) probably means that the monoallyl ether
is chiefly the 2-<i>O</i>-allyl ether. Methylenation of (<strong>II</strong>) with CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> and anhydrous
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in acetone yielded directly almost pure dill-apiole (<strong>III</strong>), characterised by the
formation of monobromodill-apiole dibromide, which was directly compared (mixed mp.) with a specimen prepared
from natural dill-apiole. The allyl groups in these compounds cannot occupy position 6, since the final
product would then be an isomeride of dill-apiole and not dill-apiole itself, the constitution of which was
definitely established by the researches of Ciamician and Silber<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and
Thoms<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. Dill-apiole has been isolated from dill oil<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, from matico oil from the leaves of <i>Piper augustifolium</i><a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>,
from sea-fennel oil<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>, and from <i>Crithmum maritimum</i><a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Methylation of (<strong>II</strong>) with methyl sulphate and alkali readily gave 1,2,3,4-tetramethoxy-5-allylbenzene, which
is apparently identical with a product isolated by Thoms<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> from
parsley oil and to which this consitution was assigned. Direct comparision of the synthetic and the natural
product was not possible in this case.</p>

<p>As possible intermediates in the synthesis of parsley apiole the following compounds have been prepared:
<i>pyrogallol methylene ether (2,3-methylenedioxyphenol)</i> (<strong>IV</strong>), by the direct methylenation of pyrogallol
with CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in acetone; gallacetophenone-4-methyl ether,
by the nuclear acylation of pyrogallol 1-monomethyl ether<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>; 7-methoxy-8-acetyl-2-methylchromone - this compound could not be hydrolysed to the
monomethyl ether of 2,4-diacetylresorcinol. Hydrolysis of 7-methoxy-8-acetyl-2-methylchromone<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>with 4% aq. NaOH at 100�C gives resacetophenone, the nuclear acetyl group in position 8 having
been replaced by hydrogen; 2,4-diacetylresorcinol is unaffected under these conditions, although it has been
recorded that reduction of this diacetyl resorcinol by Clemmensen's method yields 4-ethylresorcinol<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
<p><strong>Gallacetophenone 3,4-dimethyl ether</strong></p>

<p>To a boiling mixture of <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/orgsyn/prepContent.asp?rxntypeid=2&prep=CV2P0304">gallacetophenone</a> (16.8g, 1 mol), benzene (400 mL) and anhydrous
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (55g) was added methyl sulphate (26.5g, 2.05 mol) in one portion, and the
whole refluxed for 6 h with occasional shaking. After the addition of water (750 mL) and shaking, the
benzene layer was separated and shaken several times with NaOH solution, and the alkaline extracts solidified.
The precipitated gallacetophenone 3,4-dimethyl ether after crystallisation from MeOH had mp 75-77�C (yield 10g) (for previous methods of preparation from <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/orgsyn/prepContent.asp?rxntypeid=2&prep=CV2P0304">gallacetophenone</a>, see Perkin<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>, Perkin and Wilson<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>, David and von Kostanecki<a href="dillapiole.tetramethoxyallylbenzene.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>).</p>

<p><strong>1,2-Dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzene</strong> (<strong>I</strong>)</p>

<p>Gallacetophenone 3,4-dimethyl ether (9.8 g) in 10% NaOH solution (40 mL) was oxidised by the addition of a
3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (75 mL) in an atmosphere of coal gas. Considerable rise of temp occurred and
the mixture darkened. After about 30 min the solution was acidified, and extracted with ether, the extracts
dried and distilled, and 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzene obtained as a pale yellow oil (5 g), bp 160-170�C/20mmHg.</p>

<p><strong>1,2-Dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-5-allylbenzene</strong> (<strong>II</strong>)</p>

<p>To 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzene (12 g) and allyl bromide (8.5 g) in acetone (25 mL) was added
anhydrous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (12 g), and the mixture refluxed for 18 hours with frequent shaking.
After evaporation of the acetone, the mixture was acidified with dilute H <sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
extracted with ether, the extracts were shaken with an excess of dil. aq. NaOH, and the phenolic products
precipitated from the alkaline layer by acid and again extracted with ether. After removal of the solvent the
monoallyl ether was heated in an oil bath to about 165�C; its temp then suddenly rose to 190�C, and, after being
kept at 200�C for a few minutes, it was distilled at diminished pressure. The thick oily product (4 g), bp
160-173�C/14mmHg, which partly solidified was directly used in the following experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Dill-Apiole</strong> (<strong>1,2-Methylenedioxy-3,4-Dimethoxy-5-Allylbenzene</strong>) (<strong>III</strong>)</p>

<p>Crude 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-5-allylbenzene (4 g), CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> (5.2 g), acetone (25
mL) and anhydrous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (3 g) were refluxed for 8 hours. After removal of the acetone
and dilution of the residue with water, the methylenated product was extracted with ether, and the extracts shaken with dil. aq. NaOH
and distilled twice under reduced pressure. The dill-apiole (1 g) distilled as a colourless, almost odourless
oil at 172-173�C/16mmHg.</p>

<p><strong>1,2,3,4-Tetramethoxy-5-allylbenzene</strong></p>

<p>1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-5-allylbenzene (3 gr) in MeOH (15 mL) was shaken with methyl sulphate (8 g)
and a 10% solution of KOH (60 mL), added in portions, and finally heated on the steam-bath. After addition of
water ether extracted the 1,2,3,4-tetramethoxy-5-allylbenzene as an oil, which after distillation at
diminished pressure (bp 145�C/12mmHg) solidified when strongly cooled, and had an mp of 25�C.</p>

<p><strong>Pyrogallol Methylene Ether</strong> (<strong>IV</strong>)</p>

<p>Pyrogallol (50 g), acetone (400 mL), Me<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> (110 gr) and anhydrous
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> were refluxed for 30 hours, then diluted, acidified, and extracted with a large
volume of ether. The ethereal extract was shaken several times with water, filtered, and shaken with aq. NaOH.
The alkaline layer was acidified, extracted several times with warm light petroleum (bp 40-60�C), and yielded
a semi-solid product which, after being presses on porous porcelain and recrystallised from light petroleum
had  mp 65�C.</p>
