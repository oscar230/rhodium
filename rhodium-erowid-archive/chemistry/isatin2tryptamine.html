      <H1>A Novel Preparation of <i>alpha</i>-Substituted Tryptamines from Isatins.</H1>

      <p>Recent interest in the neuropharmacology of tryptamines, such as <i>alpha</i>
	  -methyltryptamine (II; R = H, R' = Me), led us to seek new methods for their
	  preparation. Dioxindoles (I) were readily obtained by base-catalysed condensation
	  of isatins with ketones [1]. Reduction of their oximes with lithium aluminum
	  hydride gave the required tryptamines (II; seven examples) which probably arose
	  by spontaneous dehydration of the intermediate hyroxyindoles. <i>alpha</i>-
	  Substituted have also been prepared recently by reduction of the oximes of
	  oxindoles (III) with sodium and ethanol [2]; and since our work was completed,
	  indoles have been prepared by reduction of 3-substituted oxindoles with lithium
	  aluminum hydride in ether [3].</p>

	  <p>The present reductions were also carried out with sodium borohydride-
	  aluminum chloride complex which proved especially useful for the trifluoromethyl
	  analog (II; R = 7-CF<sub>3</sub>, R' = Me) since lithium aluminum hydride
	  reduced the trifluoromethyl group to methyl. The reduction of oximes to amines
	  with sodium borohydride - aluminum chloride has not been apparently reported before.</p>
	  <p>In the preliminary experiments, we used oxindole as a model compound for reduction
	  and in our hands, the only product isolated was indole. However, Smith and Yu[4] reported
	  that their reduction of this substance with lithium aluminum hydride gives indoline
	  whereas Julian and Printy [5] were unable to reduce oxindole even at elevated temperatures.</p>
	  <h3> Experimental </h3>
	  <p><i>3-Acetonyl-3-hydroxyoxindole (I; R = H; R' = Me).</i><br>
	  To a stirred suspension, at room temperature, of isatin (294 g., 2 mol.) in
	  acetone (1 L) was added diethylamine (100 ml.) in one portion. The solid dissolves
	  exothermally during 30 min., to give a dark green solution. The mixture was stirred
	  for for a further 5.5 hr., and the solid which separated was filtered off.
	  The filtrate was evaporated to dryness on a steam-bath; the combined residues were
	  triturated with water, collected, washed with cold acetone, and dried to give
	  the dioxindole as a buff solid (350 g., 85%), m.p. 167 - 168 C (decomp.)
	  [Braude and Lindwall [6] give m.p. 167 - 168 C (decomp.)]
	  <p>In a similar manner, the following were prepared:
	  <p><i> 3-acetonyl-3-hydroxy
	  -trifluoromethyloxindole </i> <br>(I; R = 7-CF<sub>3</sub>, R' = Me) from 7-
	  trifluoromethylisatin [7], as pale yellow needles (43%) (from 50% aqueous
	  ethanol), m.p. 199 - 200 C (Found: C, 52.75; H, 3.7; N, 5.1; F, 20.2) 3-acetonyl-
	  3-hydroxy-5-methoxyoxindole (I; R = 5-OMe, R' = Me) as yellow needles (40%),
	  m.p. 176 C (decomp.) [Pietra and Tacconi [8] give m.p. 171 - 172 C (decomp.)].</p>

	  <p><i>3-acetonyl-3-hydroxy-7-methyloxindole</i><br>
	  (I; R = 7-Me, R' = Me) from 7-methylisatin as rhombes (51%) (from acetone),
	  m.p. 201-202 C (decomp.)(Found: C, 65.3; H, 5.8; N, 6.2)</p>

	  <p><i>3-acetonyl-5-fluoro-3-hydroxyoxindole</i><br>
	  (I; R = 5-F, R' = Me) (made by Miss L. Kruszynska), from 5-fluoroisatin [9]
	  as a yellow solid (64%) (from acetone) m.p. 147 - 149 C (decomp.)
	  (Found: C, 59.8; H, 4.55; N, 6.9)</p>

	  <p><i>3-hydroxy-3-phenacyloxindole</i><br>
	  (I; R = H, R' = Ph) from isatin and acetophenone, as yellow needles (55%),
	  m.p. 165 C (decomp.)[Lindwall and Maclennon [?] give m.p. 169 - 172 C (decomp.)],
	  and 3-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)oxindole (I; R = H, R' = Pr) (made by
	  Dr. S. C. R. Meacock), from isatin and isopropyl methyl ketone as a cream powder
	  (60%) (from benzene), m.p. 128 - 129 C (Found: C, 66.5; H, 6.3; N, 6.5)
	  Calculated for C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> : C, 66.9; H, 5.6; N, 6.0%)
	  (Pietra and Tacconi [2] report m.p. 138 - 139 C)</p>

	  <p><i>3-Hydroxy-3-2'-hydroxyiminopropyloxindole</i><br>
	  To 3-acetonyl-3-hydroxyoxindole (321 g., 1.6 moles) in hot 96% ethanol (2 L.)
	  was added hydroxylamine hydrochloride (118 g., 1.7 moles) in water (1 L.), followed
	  by sodium acetate (209 g., 2.6 moles) in water (1 L.). The solution was kept
	  at room temperature for 1 hour, then evaporated to a small volume <i>in vacuo</i>
	  in a water bath. A solid separated which was filtered off and crystallized in water
	  to give the <i>oxime</i> as needles (288 g., 82%), m.p. 179-180 C (decomp.)
	  (Found: C, 60.4; H, 5.5; N, 13.1)</p>

	  <p>The same method gave analogous <i>oximes</i> containing also the following
	  substituants: <i>7-trifluoromethyl</i>, needles (72%) (from water), m.p. 99 - 102 C.
	  <i>5-methoxy-</i> pale yellow rhombs (77%) (from aqueous ethanol) m.p. 162 - 163 C,
	  <i>5-fluoro-</i> cream needles (47%) (from aqueous methanol), m.p. 156.5 - 157 C (decomp.),
	  and <i>7-methyl</i> (83%), m.p. 200 - 201 C, (decomp.). <i>3-hydroxy-3-(</i>beta<i>-
	  hydroxyiminophenethyl)oxindole</i> formed needles (76%) (from ethanol), m.p. 203 - 204 C
	  (decomp.) and <i>3-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxyimino-3-methylbutyl)oxindole</i> (73%) (from benzene-
	  methanol) had m.p. 139 - 140 C (decomp.)</p>

	  <h3> alpha-<i>Methyltryptamine</i></h3>
	  <p> (II; R = H, R' = Me). (A) 3-Hydroxy-3-2'-hydroxyiminopropyl-oxindole (10 g., 0.05 mol.) in
	  tetrahydrofuran (250 ml.) was added dropwise to a stirrred suspension, at room temperature, of
	  lithium aluminum hydride (10 g., 0.28 mol.) in tetrahydrofuran  (200 ml.): a vigorous reaction
	  occurred. The red-brown mixture was refluxed for 12 hr., then cooled and treated with water
	  (40 ml.), and the resulting suspension was filtered, evaporated to a small volume <i>in vacuo</i>
	  on a water-bath, and extractdd with ether. The organic phase was dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub> and distilled
	  to afford the base (2.7 g., 34%), b.p. 137 C @ 0.3 mm/Hg (bath 175 C), giving a picrate, red-orange
	  needles (from ethanol), m.p. and mixed m.p. 226 C.</p>
	  <p> (B) To a stirred suspension of the oxime (44 g., 0.2 mol.) in freshly distilled bis-2-methoxyethyl ether
	  (400 ml.), at room temperature, was added sodium borohydride (29.6 g., 0.8 mol.): an exothermic reaction
	  occured and all the solid dissolved. When a solution of aluminum chloride (37.6 g.) in the ether (200 ml.)
	  was added a complex separated. The mixture was heated at 100 C for 48 hr., cooled, and filtered, and the residue
	  was decomposed with 10N sodium hydroxide and extracted with chloroform. Distillation of the extract yielded
	  <i>a</i>-methyl-tryptamine (10.1 g., 29%).</p>
	  <p> The above mentioned oximes were reduced by one or other of the foregoing methods to give the following tryptamine:
	  <i>5-methoxy-a-methyl-T</i> (A) (45%), b.p. 187 - 190 C @ 0.3 mm/Hg [hydrochloride, plates (from ethyl acetate-methanol)
	  , m.p. and mixed m.p. 112 - 113 C], 7-methyl-<i>a</i>-methyl-T (A) (44%), b.p. 156 - 158 C @ 0.2 mm/Hg, plates, m.p. and
	  mixed m.p [2] 226 - 227 C (decomp.)]; <i>a</i>-phenyl (A) [hydrochloride pale orange needles, m.p. [2[ 250 -253 C (decomp.)],
	  <i>a</i>-isopropyl (A) [from benzene-light petroleum (b.p. 40 - 60 C)], m.p. [2] 108 -110 C (found: C, 59.4; H, 5.8; N, 11.4
	  ; F, 23.0</p>
	  <p><i>Reduction of oxindole</i> To a stirred suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (6 g.) in ether (250 ml) at room temperature
	  was added oxindole (14 g.) in ehter (1.5 L). The mixture was refluxed for 10 hr., then cooled and decomposed with water (25 ml.).
	  The resulting suspension was filtered and distilled, affording indole (2.55 g., 20%), b.p. 126 @ 15 mm/Hg. [1,3,5-trinitro-benzene
	  adduct, yellow needles (from ethanol), m.p. and mixed m.p 166 - 169 C]</p>
