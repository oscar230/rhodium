        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>       Cannabis sativa has been a cherished friend of an ever-increasing          proportion of mankind since prehistoric times. The genus Cannabis          contains only this one species, but its appearance and psychedelic          properties vary tremendously depending on growth conditions. It seems to          have originated in Asia, but its &quot;medicinal&quot; properties and the long          fibers in its stem used to make rope (hemp) have led to its being          carried all over the world. The early American colonists brought seeds          with them and George Washington, &quot;the father of our country,&quot; was among          its cultivators. There is evidence for Cannabis use as early as 5,000          B.C. in Central Europe and there are probable references to it in the          earliest writings of China and Egypt. The frozen tombs of the          inhabitants of Siberia in about 500 B.C. have yielded quantities of          seeds along with a variety of devices for burning them. A very hot, dry          climate appears necessary for producing grass with high psychedelic          activity, which may account for the failure to use Cannabis as an          intoxicant in Northwestern Europe.</p>
        <h3>                               Cultivation</h3>
        <p>       Grass seems to grow best in loose, well fertilized soil (manure,          superphosphates). The soil should be well tilled, and the seeds          (actually drupes or achenes, a type of nut) sown about one inch apart in          rows about one foot apart and covered with about 3/4 inch of soil. Some          say it is best to use dark (not green) seeds, and to soak them overnight          in water before sowing. They can be sown in flatboxes and transplanted          when about two to six inches high (about two weeks). After the plants          have their first two leaves they can be thinned by pulling up those          which look the weakest. Cannabis is usually dioecious (male and female          flowers on separate plants). The female plants are widely believed to          contain more THC than the males, but this varies from strain to strain.         In India, the males are apparently weeded out before they have a chance          to pollinate the females and initiate seed development in the belief          that the unfertilized females produce stronger grass. This is unproven,          and even if true, the total yield of THC from a field of males plus          fertilized females may well be greater. The males are generally taller          and thinner until almost mature (3 - 4 months), when the females may          become taller. Males tend to yellow and die some weeks before the          females. Harvest takes place around September in Europe and Japan and          around July in North Africa. The sex of the plants can be influenced by          soil conditions, some experiments giving more males in moist, heavily          manured soils. Long light periods tend to masculinize, whereas plants          grown under short day conditions (for example, those seeded in northern          latitudes in winter) tend to produce intersexual flowers, males changing          to females; a condition also resulting from debudding males. It has          recently been found that male flowers tend to change to females after          early spraying with Ethrel (2-chloro-ethane-phosphonic acid). Under some          conditions, flowering may occur in as little as two weeks. A sizable          portion of the leaves can be harvested after about two months and the          plants will continue to grow. The effects of these various manipulations          on the THC yield of a single plant, or the crop as a whole, have yet to          be determined. &quot;The Induction of Flowering,&quot; L. Evans (ed.), 205(1969)          is a good reference on Cannabis flowering. Pinching off the shoot tip          when the plants are just beyond the seedling stage, and pinching off          subsequently developing side shoots at about weekly intervals thereafter          in order to keep the plant only a few feet tall, can produce plants so          altered in shape, color and leaf morphology as to be unrecognizable as          cannabis. The resins are said to accumulate on the surface of such          distorted plants to such an extent that it looks crystalline, and the          resulting grass is supposed to be as strong as hashish. For definitive          references on the cultivation and chemistry of marijuana, see MARIJUANA          GROWERS GUIDE, And/Or Press (1978) and MARIJUANA POTENCY, And/Or Press          (1977).</p>
        <h3>                              THC Extraction</h3>
        <p>       Some samples of grass have considerable THC acid. In order to extract          this it is first necessary to decarboxylate it by heating it to 110&oslash; for          fifteen minutes. Grass grown commercially for its fiber content, as well          as that grown in northern Europe or much of the U.S.A., contains mostly          the inactive cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid. These compounds can be          extracted and used to synthesize the active THC and THC acid (by          smoking, not active orally) in one step. See TET 21,1228(1965) or the          following. To extract, add 50g grass/liter petroleum ether or benzene;          soak twelve hours with occasional shaking; filter and extract petroleum          ether three times with a solution containing 5% NaOH and 5% Na2SO3.         Acidify the aqueous extracts with cold dilute sulfuric acid and extract          with ether or chloroform which is dried, evaporated in a vacuum to yield          the cannabidiolic acid. THC and cannabidiol remain in the petroleum          ether which can be dried and evaporated in a vacuum and the residue          added to grass. THC acid is converted to THC by boiling in benzene for          seven hours.</p>
        <h3>      THC Extraction for Smuggling or Converting Poor Grass to Good</h3>
        <p>       This is recommended to anyone who wants to smuggle or otherwise conceal          grass or hash. One hundred kilos of grass will convert to about two or          three kilos of resin, which can later be redissolved and absorbed on          alfalfa, etc. See Lloydia 33,453(1970) for a method of large scale          extraction. Cover grass or hash with methanol, benzene, petroleum ether,          or isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Allow to soak for about twelve hours,          filter and repeat soaking with fresh solvent. This process can be          speeded up by gently heating the solvent plus grass (no flames) for          about three hours, adding more solvent if necessary. Evaporate the          combined solvent extracts until a resin is obtained or until syrupy and          absorb the syrup on grass, etc. Repeat the process until no more resin          is obtained, or until smoking some of the residual grass indicates that          all the THC has been extracted. Methylene chloride works very well.         Unleaded gas, preferably without additives (white gas), paint thinner or          remover, or turpentine should be satisfactory. For a detailed          discussion, see MARIJUANA POTENCY, And/Or Press (1977).</p>
        <h3>                                  Dosage</h3>
        <p>       Smoking seems to destroy most of the THC, but even so, this is several          times more efficient than eating it, since the smoking dose of delta-1          THC is about 2mg and the eating dose about 10mg. Based on a 5% THC          content, 1g of hash efficiently used should (by smoking) stone about 25          people. Partial tolerance to THC develops rapidly and most users observe          that they get much higher the first time a given batch of grass is          smoked than on subsequent occasions. However, for unknown reasons,          tolerance to grass of different origin seems less, leading some people          to desire a different batch for each day of the week.</p>
        <h3>                            Official THC Tests</h3>
        <p>       One-tenth gram powdered grass, 5ml petroleum ether; grind in mortar and          let soak fifteen minutes. Filter and add 1ml of the petroleum ether          carefully to 2 ml 15% HCl in absolute ethanol. Red color at boundary of          two layers indicates THC. After shaking, the upper layer is colorless          and the lower orange-pink which turns colorless after addition of 1 ml          of water. Alternatively, evaporate the petroleum ether, add 2 ml          Duquenois reagent ( 12 drops acetaldehyde, 1 g vanillin, 50 ml ethanol),          2 ml HCl and stir. Let stand 10 minutes and add 2 ml chloroform; shake          and let separate. A purple chloroform layer indicates THC. Also useful          but less specific is the fact that THC gives a purple color with 5% KOH          in ethanol. A few grains of sucrose will often intensify color          development in these tests. (See Bulletin on Narcotics 22,33(1970)).</p>
        <h3>                              THC Chemistry</h3>
        <h3>                               Is It Legal?</h3>
        <p>       The delta-1 and delta-1(6) THC's with the n-pentyl in the 5' position          (obtained by using olivetol in the syntheses) are naturally occurring          and hence illegal, but the delta-3 THC's and the numerous isomers,          homologs and analogs of the delta-1 and delta-1(6) compounds are          probably legal. Apparently, recent federal legislation outlaws delta-1,          delta-1(6), delta-3,4-THC's, both cis and trans and D and L and          compounds. This still leaves hundreds of legal cannabinoids.</p>
        <h3>                     Structure-Activity Relationships</h3>
        <p>       THC refers to tetrahydrocannabinol, and delta refers to the position of          the double bond. Various numbering systems are used, so the following          equivalences should be noted: delta-1-THC = delta-1-3,4-trans-THC =          delta-9-THC and delta-6-THC = delta-1(6)-THC = delta-8-THC = delta-6-         3,4- trans-THC. Little careful human testing has been done, so data          given here and elsewhere on the relative psychedelic activity of various          cannabinoids is often only a rough guess. Delta-1-THC and delta-6-THC          have about the same activity which is about five times that of delta-3-         THC. Cannabidiol, cannabidiolic acid, cannabinol, cannabigerol and          cannabichromene all have very little or no activity. Only the L (-)          isomer of THC seems to be active. When the n-pentyl at the 5' position          is replaced by 1,2-dimethylheptyl, potency and duration of action          increases about five times, giving the most active THC analog yet          tested. It should be noted that recent testing has indicated that a 1,1-         dimethylheptyl or 1-methyloctyl and probably similar side chains give          THC's of equal or greater activity than the 1,2-dimethylheptyl cpd.         However, the difficulty of synthesizing these compounds plus their very          long action (up to several days or more) makes it doubtful whether they          deserve all the interest they have generated among psychedelic          enthusiasts. More concern should be devoted to the shorter side chains,          since they would presumably allow one to get very stoned but to be          straight again within a few hours, thus allowing the drug to be more          easily manipulated. Substituting N, O, or S atoms at various places or          saturating the double bond to produce hexahydrocannabinol probably          retains activity. (See CA 74,125667(1971) for S analogs.) Alkoxy side          chains at 5' retain activity. Unsaturated side chains are as active as          saturated ones. Ether moieties at the 5' position, but not at the 3',          retain activity. Activity is retained if an additional alkyl is placed          at 4' but lost if placed at 6'. Activity is greatly decreased or lost if          the H at the 4' or 6' positions is replaced by carboxyl, carbomethoxyl,          acetyl or acetoxyl; if the hydroxyl is replaced by H; if the OH is at 5'          and the side chain at 4'. Methyl and/or ethyl at 1 and 5 retains          activity, as does removal of the methyl at 1. An hydroxyl in the side          chain is active, but not on the first carbon of the side chain.         Esterifying the OH retains activity, but etherifying eliminates          activity. THC can be synthesized via cannabigerol and cannabichromene in          low yield (TET 24,4830(1968), TL 5349,5353(1969), Proc. Chem. Soc.         82,(1964)). For several moderately difficult routes leading to delta-         1(6)-THC via cannabinol in about 10% yield, see LAC 685,126( 1965). For          a synthesis of delta-1(6)-THC from cinnamyl derivatives and isoprene see          JACS 89,4551(1967). A rather difficult synthesis of delta-1 and delta-         1(6)-THC is given in JACS 89,5934(1967). For a variety of THC analogs of          unknown activity see BSC 1374, 1384(1968); JCS 952(1949); JACS 63,1971,          1977,2766(1941), 64,694,2031,2653(1942), 67,1534(1945), 70,662( 1948),          71,1624(1949), 82,5198( 1960); CA 75,48910 (1971); TL 3405(1967); JMC          11,377(1968); CT 2,167(1967); CA 76,126783(1972). Since 0 or 1 and          perhaps 2 double bonds anywhere in the lefthand ring below, as well as          changes in the size and position of the alkyl groups will probably all          produce compounds with THC activity, many compounds similar to          menthadieneol, menthatriene, verbenol, epoxycarene, pulegone and 4-         carbethoxy-1-Me-3-cyclohexanone can be used in the methods below to get          active THC analogs (e.g., isopipertinol will work (TL 945 (1972))).         Also, 5-chlororesorcinol and 5-methylresorcinol (orcinol) have been          shown to give weakly active THC's (see CA 76,33946(1972), US Patent          3,028,410 (1962), and TET 23,3435(1967) for syntheses of orcinol and          related compounds). Unfortunately, recent data indicate that orcinol          gives a THC with very low activity. It appears that delta-5 and delta-7          THC have very little activity. If the methyl groups at carbon 8 in THC          are changed to longer alkyl groups, the activity decreases, but the          replacement of the alkyl groups by hydrogen or other groups has not been          carried out. Open chain analogs also have activity (see CT 2,167(          1967)). For new information on the structure-activity relationships of          cannabinoids see JMC 16, I 200( 1973), Arzneim, Forsch 22,1995 (1972),          and Chem. Revs. 76,75(1976).

        <p>       The following gives the synthesis of a water soluble THC derivative          which is equipotent with THC and perhaps more rapidly acting (see          Science 177,442(1972)). Stir equimolar amounts of THC,          dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and gamma-morpholinobutyric acid hydrochloride          (or gamma-piperidinobutyric acid hydrochloride) (JACS 83,2891 ( 1961 ))          in methylene chloride at room temperature for 16 hours and filter,          evaporate in vacuum (can triturate with ether and filter). The cost of          synthetic THC will vary greatly depending on many factors, but high          quality grass can probably be produced for under $20 a kilo. For good          reviews of marijuana chemistry see Prog. Chem. Natural Prod. 25,175(          1967), Science 168,1159(1970), C. Joyce and J. Curry (Eds.), Botany and          Chemistry of Cannabis ( 1970), JACS 93,217( 1971 ), JPS 60,1433( 1971 ),          Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 191(1971), Prog. Org. Chem. 8,78(1973), Marijuana-         R. Mechoulam (Ed.) (1973), and Chemical Reviews 76,75(1976). Only the          first three methods below give the natural L (-) isomer of THC. The          other methods give the racemic produce and consequently their yields of          active THC are actually one-half that indicated.</p>

        <h3>                                Method I</h3>
        <p>       This method gives about 50% yield for THC and about 90% for the 1',1'-         dimethylpentyl analog. Olivetol 4.74 g (or equimolar amount of analog),          4.03 g (+) cis or trans p-methadien (2,8)-ol-1 (the racemic compound can          be used but yield will be one-half), 0.8 g p-toluenesulfonic acid in 250          ml benzene; reflux two hours (or use 0.004 Moles trifluoracetic acid and          reflux five hours). Cool, add ether, wash with NaHCO3 and dry, evaporate          in vacuum to get about 9 g of mixture (can chromatograph on 350 g silica          gel - benzene elutes the THC; benzene:ether 98:2 elutes an inactive          product; then benzene:ether 1:1 elutes unreacted olivetol; evaporate in          vacuum to recover olivetol).</p>
        <h3>                                 Method 2</h3>
        <p>       Dissolve the olivetol or analog and p-menthadienol or p-methatriene          (1,5,8) in 8 ml liquid SO2 in a bomb and fuse 70 hours at room          temperature. Proceed as above to get about 20% yield. L (-)-delta-1(6)-         THC JACS 89,4552(1967), JCS (C) 579(1971), cf. Diss. Abst.         35B,3843(1974), and Phytochemistry 14,213 (1975). Convert (-) alpha-         pinene to (-) verbenol (see precursors section). Add 1M(-) verbenol          (racemic verbenol will give one-half yield), 1M olivetol or analog with          methylene chloride as solvent. Add BF3 etherate and let stand at room          temperature one-half hour to get approximately 35% yield after          evaporating in vacuum or purifying as above to recover unreacted          olivetol. Solvent and catalyst used in Method 1 above will probably also          work. Either cis or trans verbenol can be used. The JCS paper adds 1 g          BF3-etherate to a solution of 1 g olivetol and 1.1 g verbenol in 200 ml          methylene chloride and let stand two hours at room temperature. JACS          94,6164(1972) recommends two hours at -10&oslash;C, then one-half hour at room          temperature and the use of cis rather than trans verbenol (the latter          gradually decomposes at room temperature). The reaction is also carried          out under nitrogen, using twice as much verbenol as olivetol, 0.85 ml          BF3 etherate and 85 ml methylene chloride/g verbenol (both freshly          distilled over calcium hydride) to give ca. 50% yield. See also JACS          94,6159(1972) for the use of citral and Arzneim. Forsch. 22,1995(1972)          for use of p-TSA. In the synthesis of THC with verbenol, the cis isomer          is preferable to the trans since the latter decomposes at room          temperature. Pinene or cawone give active THC's (JMC 17,287(74)).</p>

IX-XII (1962) gives          information on related compounds) in 10 ml concentrated sulfuric acid.         The concentrated sulfuric acid should be added dropwise, with cooling          (cf. U.S. Patent 3,429,889). Add 3 ml POCl3 and stir at room temperature          for 24 hours. Neutralize with NaHCO3 to precipitate 2.3g (I). Filter;          wash precipitate with NaHCO3 and recrystallize from acetonitrile.         Dissolve 4.3 g (I) in 30 ml anisole and add 0.1 M methyl MgI in 50 ml          anisole. Stir 12 hours and evaporate in vacuum or acidify with sulfuric          acid, neutralize with NaHCO3 and filter; wash to get 2.4 g N-benzyl          analog of THC. For other N-analogs of unknown activity see JOC          33,2995(1968). Recover unreacted olivetol as usual.</p>
        <p>      The 5-aza analogs given in the JOC ref. seem to be active but they use          the pyrone intermediate from certain routes of THC synthesis for a          precursor. See U.S. Patent 3,493,579 (03 Feb 1970) for quinuclidine          analogs and JOC 38,440(1973) for a different approach to N-analogs.

        Delta-1(6) THC U.S. Patent 3,576,887
<p>      This synthetic route allows one to proceed from the alkylresorcinol          dimethyl ether without using a compound of the verbenol or cyclohexanone          type. Synthesis of olivetol aldehyde (Aust. J. Chem. 21,2979 (1968)). To          a stirred solution of phenyllithium (1.6g bromobenzene and 0.16g Li) in          50 ml ether, add 0.01M olivetol dimethyl ether (or analog -- see          elsewhere here for preparation) in 5 ml ether and reflux 4 hours. Add 5          ml N-methylformanilide, reflux 1 hour and wash with 2x50 ml dilute          sulfuric acid, 50 ml water, 25 ml saturated NaCl and dry, evaporate in          vacuum the ether (can dissolve in benzene and filter through 100g of          alumina) to get 60% yield of the dimethylolivetol aldehyde (I)          (recrystallize from ether-pentane). Can recover unreacted starting          material by refluxing the vacuum distillate 3 hours with excess 10% HCl,          removing the organic layer and extracting the aqueous layer with ether:          wash and dry, evaporate in vacuum the combined ether layers. An          alternative method for (I) (JACS 65,361(1943)). In a 200 ml 3 neck round          bottom flask with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel and a          nitrogen inlet tube, introduce a rapid stream of nitrogen and in the          stream issuing from the central neck, cut 1.5g of lithium into ca. 70          pieces and drop into the flask containing about 25 ml dry ether. Place          the fittings in position, slow the nitrogen stream and add 1/2 of the          solution of 9.2g n-butyl-chloride in 25 ml dry ether. Start the stirring          and add the rest of the n-butyl-chloride at a rate giving a gentle          reflux. Continue stirring and reflux 2 hours and add 15 ml olivetol          dimethyl ether in 25 ml dry ether. Reflux 2 hours and add dropwise a          solution of 15 ml N-methylformanilide in 25 ml dry ether with stirring          at a rate sufficient to produce refluxing. Continue stirring 1 hour,          treat with 3% sulfuric acid and then pour into excess of this acid.         Remove upper layer and extract aqueous layer twice with ether. Wash          combined ether layers with dilute aqueous NaHCO3 and water and dry,          evaporate in vacuum the ether (can distill 148-52/0.3) to get 78% (I).         JACS 65,361(1943). A mixture of 6.5g (I) (or analog), 20 ml pyridine, 1          ml piperidine and 9g malonic acid is warmed on a steam bath 1 hour. Add          another 1 g malonic acid and heat another 1/2 hour. Reflux 1/2 hour and          pour into excess iced 10% HCl, stirring occasionally over 2 hours.         Filter and dry to get 6 g 2,6-dimethoxy-4-n-amycinnamic acid (II)          (recrystallize from ethanol). 10g (II), 40 ml 80% isoprene and 40 ml dry          xylene or toluene is heated in an autoclave at 185&oslash;C for 15 hours. Cool,          dilute with 160 ml petroleum ether and shake with 100 ml saturated aq.         Na2CO3. Let stand and separate the middle layer. Wash the middle layer          with a mixture of petroleum ether and dilute aq. Na2CO3 and again          separate the middle layer and treat with 75 ml 10% HCl and 75 ml ether.         Shake, separate the aqueous layer and wash the ether 3 times with water.         Dry and evaporate in vacuum the ether and dissolve the residue in          petroleum ether. The solid which ppts. after about 10 minutes is          unchanged (II). Filter and let stand in refrigerator overnight and dry          and evaporate in vacuum to precipitate about 7 g of the 1-methyl-5 (2,6-         dimethoxy-4-n-amylphenyl)-1-cyclohexene-4-COOH (III) (recrystallize from          petroleum ether). 1g (III) in 5 ml dry ether is added to 10 ml 3M MeMgI          (from 0.21 g Mg and 1.2g methyl iodide) in ether, heated to 130&oslash;C to          evaporate the solvent and the oil kept at a bath temperature of 165&oslash; C          for 1/2 hour. Cool in dry ice-acetone bath and cautiously add ammonium          chloride-ice water mix to decompose the excess Grignard reagent. Acidify          with dilute HCl and extract with ether. Wash with NaCl, dilute K2CO3,          NaCl and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get the dimethyl derivative (IV).         Reflux (IV) in 25 ml benzene with 100 mg p-toluenesulfonic acid for 1          hour with a Dean-Stark trap and dry, evaporate in vacuum (or wash with          NaHCO3, NaCl first) to get the THC or analog. Hydrolysis of benzopyrones          (for synthesis see elsewhere here) will produce compounds of type (III)          which will work in this synthesis. The hydrolysis proceeds as follows          (JCS 926(1927)): Add 10g of the benzopyrone to 20g 30% NaOH, cool and          shake 1 hour with 19 ml methylsulfate. Extract the oil with ether and          dry, evaporate in vacuum to get the ester. Acidify the aqueous solution          and filter, wash, dissolve ppt. in sodium carbonate and acidify, filter          to get the free acid. Both the acid and the ester will work in this          synthesis. For a possible route to benzopyrones via condensation of          isoprene and 3-CN-5-OH-7-alkyl-coumarin see JACS 82,5198( 1960). See JMC          16,1200 (1973) for another ref. on the pyrone route to THC.</p>

Combine the organic layer and          benzene and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get the THC analog.</p>
        Delta-3 THC analogs from Resorcinol TET 23,83(1967)
<p>       22g resorcinol,36 g 4-carbethoxy-1-methyl-3-cyclohexanone, 20g          polyphosphoric acid; heat to 105&oslash;C and when the exothermic reaction          which occurs subsides, heat at 140&oslash;C for one-half hour. Pour onto ice-         water; filter; wash with water and recrystallize-ethanol to get 34g of          the pyrone (I). 6.4g (I), 8 ml caproyl-Cl or analog (for preparation see          above reference, page 84); heat on oil bath (can use mineral oil) at          120&oslash;C until the exothermic reaction subsides (HCl evolution). Cool and          pour into ethanol. Filter to get 8g precipitate (II). 3.2g (II), 4.4g          dry AlCl3; heat on oil bath at 170&oslash;C for one hour. Cool and add HCl;          filter and dissolve precipitate in 7 ml 2N NaOH. Filter and acidify with          HCl to precipitate 1.4 g (III) (recrystallize-ethanol). Test this for          activity. Use benzoyl-Cl or benzoic anhydride to esterify the OH group          (this may not be necessary), methyl MgBr or methyl MgI to methylate the          keto group, and sulfuric acid to dehydrate and hydrogenate as described          elsewhere here to get the THC analog. Since the resulting THC analog has          the side chain at the 6' position, it may not be active. This paper also          gives a synthesis for THC analogs with the side chain in the 4'          position, but again their activity in man is unknown. Verbenol, etc.,          should work in this synthesis, thus obviating the need for the          methylation step.</p>

Cool and can distill (57/10) to get about 25  g mixture of Delta-3 and Delta-4 carene (residue is unchanged starting material)  containing about 60% Delta-4 isomer. Alternatively, to 150 ml ethylene diamine  add portionwise with stirring at 110&oslash;C under Argon or N2, 5.3 g Li metal; after  one hour add dropwise 110g (+) Delta-3 carene.

Extract with ether, wash the ether five times with water and dry,  evaporate in vacuum to get 100 g of a mix containing about 40% (+) Delta-4  carene (can separate by fractional distillation). Delta-4 carene can also be  obtained from Delta-3 carene as follows: (JCS(C)46(1966)): Dissolve 1 g Delta-3  carene in 50 ml propionic acid and heat at a suitable temperature (e.g., one- half hour at room temperature may do) in presence of 1/2g Palladium-Carbon  catalyst (5%) in ethanol and filter, evaporate in vacuum (can distill  63.5/19.5).

        <p>       Since the method as given originally leads to 4-alkyl resorcinols which          do not produce an active THC, it is here modified to give the 5-alkyl          isomers. The method is illustrated for 1.2-dimethyl-heptyl resorcinol          which gives a much more active THC than olivetol. Convert 3,5-         dihydroxyacetophenone (5-acetyl resorcinol) to 3,5-         dimethoxyacetophenone(I) in the usual way with dimethylsulfate.</p>

Add          over 1 1/2 hours a solution of 90 g (I) in 200 ml tetrahydrofuran and          reflux 10 hours. Cool and add 180 ml saturated NH4Cl; decant the          solvents and extract the residue with tetrahydrofuran. Combine the          solvents and the tetrahydrofuran and dry, evaporate in vacuum. Add a few          drops 20% sulfuric acid to the residual oil and evaporate in vacuum the          water (oil bath temperature 120-130&oslash;C/10mm). Distill the oil at oil bath          temperature 285&oslash;C/0.2. Fraction boiling 128-140/0.2 yields about 60 g 2-         (3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2-octene(II). If saponified and used to          synthesize a THC, this might give an active product, thus disposing of          the necessity of the next step. Hydrogenate 50 g (II) in 100 ml ethanol,          2-3 atmospheres H2, 0.6 g 10% Palladium-Carbon catalyst for two hours,          or until no more H2 uptake (or use the NaBH4-Ni method described at the          start).

Add 0.0075M propyl iodide or          homolog and keep 12 hours at room temperature. Heat 2 hours at 90&oslash;C and          cool to room temperature. Add 3g zinc dust and 5 ml glacial acetic acid;          stir at room temperature four hours and filter. Add 20 ml water to          filtrate and extract with 50 ml ether. Wash the ether layer with 2x50 ml          10% K2CO3, 50 ml water and 20 ml saturated NaCl. Dry and evaporate in          vacuum to get oily 3,5-dimethoxyphenylbutyl ketone (can chromatograph on          50 g alumina and elute with 3:1 petroleum ether:ether). Recrystallize          from ethanol. Hydrogenolysis (see Aust. J. Chem. 18,2015(1965) or          elsewhere here) gives the olivetol dimethyl ether.</p>

        <p>        The method is illustrated for olivetol preparation, but substituted          thiophens can be used to get olivetol homologs. To a stirred solution of          45g 3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride and 17.4g thiophen in 300 ml benzene          at 0&oslash;C, add dropwise 10.5g freshly distilled stannic chloride. Stir one          hour at room temperature and add 200 ml 3% aqueous HCl. Separate the          benzene layer and wash the aqueous layer with benzene. Dry and evaporate          in vacuum the combined benzene layers and distill the red residue (250&oslash;C          bath/4.5) to get 45g 2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl) thiophen(I). Recrystallize          from petroleum ether. Add a solution of 21 g AlCl3 in 160 ml ether to a          stirred suspension of 6.1 g lithium aluminum hydride in 140 ml ether.         After 5 minutes add a solution of 39g(I) in 300 ml ether at a rate          giving a gentle reflux. Reflux and stir 1 hour; cool in an ice bath and          treat dropwise with 50 ml water, then 50 ml 6N aqueous sulfuric acid.         Separate the layers, extract the aqueous layer with 3x100 ml ether and          dry, evaporate in vacuum the combined ether layers. Can distill the          residue (230&oslash;C bath/5mm) to get 27g oily 2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzyl)          thiophen (II). Recrystallize from petroleum ether. Reflux a solution of          5g (II) in 700 ml ethanol with W-7 Raney Nickel prepared from Ni-Al          alloy (see Org. Synthesis Coll. Vol III,176(1955)) for 6 hours. Filter,          evaporate in vacuum and can distill (140/0.01) to get about 2.2g oily          olivetol dimethyl ether which can be reduced to olivetol as described          elsewhere here. The use of the novel reduction methods described at the          beginning of this section would render this method much simpler.</p>

Add 110g diethylmalonate and stir 10 minutes.         Add portionwise 75g 90% pure 3-nonene-2-one (for olivetol-preparation          below) keeping the temperature below the boiling point (50-60&oslash;C). Stir          and reflux 3 hours, then cool to room temperature, neutralize with about          50 ml concentrated HCl and let stand overnight. Evaporate in a vacuum          and dissolve the residue in 200 ml 1N HCl and 800 ml ethylacetate.         Separate and wash the ethylacetate with 2x300 ml water and extract with          saturated NaHCO3 until a small portion gives no turbidity upon          acidification (about 5x200 ml). Carefully acidify the combined NaHCO3          extracts and then extract with 3x300 ml ether. Dry and evaporate in          vacuum the ether (can dry under vacuum several days) to get 6-n-pentyl-         2-OH-4-oxo-cyclohex-2-ene-1-methyl- carboxylate(I). 4.8 g (I) and 100 ml          glacial acetic acid are stirred vigorously at 75&oslash;C until dissolved. Cool          and keep temperature between 5 and 10&oslash;C while adding a solution of 3.9g          bromine in 10 ml glacial acetic acid dropwise over 1 hour. Stir 1 hour          at room temperature then 3 hours on a steam bath. Evaporate in vacuum          and dissolve the residual oil in 200 ml ether. Wash with 2x25 ml 10%          sodium dithionite, 2x25 ml saturated NaHCO3 and water and dry, evaporate          in vacuum to get olivetol (or analog) (can distill at 125-130/0.05).

Stir and reflux 10 hours, evaporate in vacuum, dissolve residue in 250          ml ether and proceed as above to get olivetol. A third alternative is to          stir 12.2g (I) in 100 ml glacial acetic acid at 25&oslash;C with vigorous          stirring until well suspended. Cool and keep temperature at 5-10&oslash;C while          adding dropwise 22.4g cupric bromide dissolved in 25 ml glacial acetic          acid over 1 hour. Stir 1 hour at room temperature then 3 hours on a          steam bath and evaporate in vacuum. Dissolve the residue in 200 ml water          and 300 ml ether. Wash the ether layer with 2X50 ml 10% sodium          dithionite, 2x35 ml saturated NaHCO3 and 75 ml water and dry, evaporate          in vacuum to get olivetol (or analog).</p>

Filter, wash precipitate with about 4x75 ml cold water and dry in vacuum  at 50&oslash;C to get 26g 3-bromo-2-OH-4-oxo-6- (1,2-dimethylheptyl)-cyclohex-2-ene-1- methylcarboxylate(II). In a 3 liter 3 necked flask with a stirrer, thermometer,  reflux head and Dean-Stark trap, add 350g (II) and 522g pyridine hydrochloride  and heat on oil bath at 90&oslash;C 4 hours. Heat with the heating mantle (removing  volatiles with the Dean-Stark trap) until the internal temperature reaches 190- 200&oslash;C and hold at this temperature 2 hours. Cool to room temperature and shake  with 3 liters ether and 660 ml 1.2N HCl and then 2x300 ml water. Extract the  ether solution with 4x350 ml 10% NaOH and then extract the combined NaOH  extracts with 2x300 ml ether. Acidify the alkaline solution with about 700 ml  concentrated HCl and extract with 3x800 ml ether.

        <p>        This is an improved version of a previously given synthesis (LAC 630,71          (1960)). The ethanol used is distilled from Ca ethoxide; dimethoxyethane          from potassium. Cupric bromide is produced from cupric oxide and 5%          excess of HBr, plus sufficient bromine to remove the milkiness on          addition of a drop of the mixture to water; concentrate and dry,          evaporate in vacuum over KOH flakes. 650g (5.3M) ethyl chloroacetate and          880g (5.3M) triethyl phosphite are mixed and placed in a 3 liter flask          fitted with a thermometer and condenser under nitrogen. Heat and stir          and slowly bring to 125&oslash;C. Discontinue heating as ethyl chloride          evolution proceeds over 1/2 hour. Heat to 160&oslash;C over a 75 minute period          and keep at 160o C 8 hours. Cool,distill (e.g., through 12&quot; Vigreux          column) (74-7/0.03) to get 96% yield of triethylphosphonoacetate (I). In          a 3 liter flask fitted with a stirrer, dropping funnel and condenser,          place 45.3g NaH (1M in mineral oil) and 1 liter of dry ether. Flush with          nitrogen and keep at positive nitrogen pressure. Stir in ice bath while          224 g (1M) (I) is added dropwise over 75 min. Stir and reflux 1 hour (H2          evolution stops). Cool in ice-salt bath and add 1M of aldehyde (e.g.,          hexaldehyde for olivetol) over 1 hour. Continue to cool and stir an          additional 10 minutes and then slowly bring to reflux and reflux for 10          minutes (ppt. prevents stirring). Decant the ether and dissolve the oil          layer in 500 ml warm water and separate the upper organic layer. Extract          the aqueous layer with 200 mI ether and extract the combined organic          solutions with 200 ml saturated NaHCO3. Dry and evaporate in vacuum (can          distill) to get the ethyl-&aacute;-alkylacrylates in about 90% yield (II). In a          flask with nitrogen and fittings as in preceding step, add 156 g ethyl          acetoacetate to Na ethoxide from 25.3g Na and 500 ml dry ethanol, and          stir and reflux 1/2 hour. Add 1M of (II) dropwise over 90 minutes and          reflux 20 hours. Cool in ice, filter, wash ppt. with 500 ml ice cold          absolute ethanol and several times with portions of ether and dry,          evaporate in vacuum to get the dione Na salt (III) in about 80% yield          (for olivetol precursor). In a 250 ml flask place 0.1 M (III),100 ml          1,2-dimethoxyethane and flush with nitrogen and stir at room temperature          while 45g of cupric bromide is added portionwise over 5 minutes, under a          nitrogen stream. Stir 1/2 hour and then reflux and stir 1 hour. Cool and          evaporate (keep temperature below 50&oslash;C) but do not remove more than          about 65 ml dimethoxyethane. Dilute the remaining solution with 200 ml          benzene and filter. Wash the ppt. with 50 ml benzene and evaporate the          combined benzene filtrates (keep temperature below 50&oslash;C). Dissolve the          bromodione in 100 ml dimethylformamide and put in 500 ml flask under          nitrogen. Stir and heat slowly until reflux and then heat to 150&oslash;C and          reflux 4 hours. Cool, pour into 500 ml water, extract with 3x100 ml          dichloromethane and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get the ethyl-6-alkyl-         2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (IV). Add a solution of 24g NaOH in 200 ml water          to (IV) and stir and reflux under nitrogen in hood for 3 hours. Cool in          ice bath, acidify carefully with a cold solution of 20 ml concentrated          sulfuric acid in 80 ml water while stirring under nitrogen in ice bath.         Reflux under nitrogen 5 minutes, cool, extract 3 times with ether and          dry, evaporate in vacuum the combined extracts to get about 80% yield of          olivetol (or analog). The last step may not be necessary since (IV) may          yield an active THC.</p>
        <p>Dimethylheptylresorcinol CA 65,20062(1966)</p>
        <p>        This method is specifically designed to produce good yields of          dimethylheptylresorcinol, which provides, after synthesis by any of the          various routes, one of the most active THC analogs yet discovered. Note          that the synthesis may not have to be carried all the way to the          alkylresorcinol since the intermediate ketones etc. may give an active          THC analog. Mix 294g (1.6M) 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, 184g (3.4M) Na          methoxide and 450g (3 3M) diglyme and reflux at 162&oslash;C for 42 hours. Cool          to room temperature, filter and distill the solvent to get 70% yield of          1-Cl-3,5-dimethoxybenzene (I). 43.2g (I) in 540 ml tetrahydrofuran is          added dropwise to 7.3g Mg, a small crystal of iodine and a few drops of          ethyl bromide (under nitrogen if possible) over 1/2 hour while the          mixture is heated to 75&oslash;C. Reflux 2 hours and cool to room temperature          to obtain the Grignard solution. To anhydrous liquid ammonia in a cooled          flask, add Fe(NO3)3*9H2O and then small pieces of sodium and bubble air          through the solution until reaction is observed. Add more sodium          portionwise until 11.5g is in solution. To the solution at its reflux          temperature, add 27.6g (0.5M) proprionitrile (or isobutyronitrile etc.         for analogs) and add the resulting solution dropwise to 53.3g 1-Cl-         pentane (or 0.5M analog such as 2-Br-hexane etc.) and let the ammonia          evaporate. Add ether, then water to the residue and separate the aqueous          layer and extract with ether. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the combined          ether solutions to give 64% yield of 2-methyl-heptanonitrile (II) (or          analog). Add 34.0g (0.27M) (II) in tetrahydrofuran to the Grignard          solution of (I) over 1/2 hour, heat 6 hours at 60&oslash;C and hydrolyze with          1600 ml 50% sulfuric acid, keeping the temperature below 40&oslash;C. Evaporate          in vacuum the solvent and add another 400 ml 50% sulfuric acid. Heat 1          hour at 95-100&oslash;C, cool, add ether, separate the aqueous layer and          extract with ether. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the combined ether          layers to get 71% yield 2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl) heptane (III) (can          distill 133-8/0.2), which can be demethylated as described for the          preparation of (VII) below and possibly used to synthesize an active THC          analog (as can IV, V, or VI). 21.8g (0.082M) (III) is added dropwise          (keeping the temperature at 15-20&oslash;C) to 3 molar methyl-MgBr in ether and          refluxed 1 hour. Pour into a sulfuric acid-ice mix, add more sulfuric          acid and stir. Separate and extract the aqueous layer with ether. Wash,          dry, filter and evaporate in vacuum the combined ether layers to get 2-         (3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl- octanol (IV), which is dehydrated by          mixing with anhydrous oxalic acid and heating to 130-40&oslash;C. Extract the          dehydrated reaction products with benzene to get the octenes (V). Add          25g (V), 2.5g 65% Ni on kieselguhr in dry hexane to hydrogenator and          hydrogenate at 1750 psi and gradually increase the temperature to 125o          C. After 3 hours, increase the pressure to 1850 psi and hold there 2 1/2          hours. filter and evaporate in vacuum to get 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-         methyl-octane (VI). Add 20g (0.08M) (VI) to 38% HBr in glacial acetic          acid and stir and reflux for 6 hours. Pour onto ice and water,          neutralize with solid sodium carbonate and extract with ether. Extract          the ether with 10% aqueous NaOH, acidify the aqueous solution with HCl,          extract with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum (can distill) to get 2-         (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl- octane (VII) (5-(1,2-dimethylheptyl)-         resorcinol). As an alternative process for getting from (III) to (VI),          combine 64.2g (0.18M) methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in dry benzene          with 11.6g (0.18M) (in 14% solution) butyllithium in benzene. Heat to          60&oslash;C and cool. 49.0g (0.176M) (III) in 40 ml dry benzene is added (keep          temperature below 40&oslash;C) and then reflux 2 hours. Cool, filter and          evaporate in vacuum to get the octene, which after catalytic          hydrogenation as described for (V) yields (VI).</p>

Remove the acetone, add one          liter water and one liter ether to the residue and extract. Wash the          ether extract with 2x100 ml concentrated NH4OH, 2x100 ml dilute HCl and          100 ml water and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get 48g methyl-3,5-         dimethoxybenzoate (I). Recrystallize from aqueous methanol. To a stirred          suspension of 19g lithium aluminium hydride in 200 ml ether add 78.4g          (I) in 300 ml ether at a rate which gives gentle refluxing. Reflux 2 1/2          hours, cool and add 50 ml wet ether; then 100 ml dilute sulfuric acid.         Wash and dry, evaporate in vacuum the ether extract to get 62g oily 3,5-         dimethoxybenzyl alcohol (II). Recrystallize from ether-pentane. To a          cooled stirred slurry of 15g CrO3 and 250 ml pyridine add 8.4g (II) in          25 ml pyridine and let stand 1 hour at room temperature. Add 60 ml          methanol, let stand 2 hours, and dilute with 500 ml 5% NaOH and 500 ml          ether. Extract the aqueous layer with ether and wash the combined ether          layers with 500 ml water, 3x500 ml 5% sulfuric acid, 500 ml water and          200 ml saturated NaCl and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get 7g 3,5-         dimethoxybenzaldehyde (III). Re-crystallize from ether-pentane. To a          flask with a dropping funnel and condenser add 0.58g Mg turnings and 10          ml ether. Add a few drops of a solution of lauryl bromide (5.7g) or          equimolar amount of homolog in 15 ml ether and start reaction by adding          2 drops methyl iodide. Add the remaining bromide solution with stirring          and gentle refluxing over 15 minutes and then reflux 3 hours. Cool in an          ice bath and add 3.1g (III) in 5 ml ether dropwise with stirring over 45          minutes. Reflux 4 hours, cool and dilute with ice water. Wash the          organic layer with 2x25 ml 3N sulfuric acid, 2x25 ml 10% K2CO3, 25 ml          water, 25 ml saturated NaCl and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get 5g 3,5-         dimethoxyphenyldodecyl methanol (IV) or homolog. Recrystallize from          methanol. Hydrogenate 4.2g (IV) in 50 ml ethyl acetate with 5 drops          concentrated sulfuric acid and 0.5g 10% Palladium-Carbon catalyst at          room temperature and 5 atmospheres hydrogen for 4 hours. Filter and          evaporate in vacuum to get the aklylresorcinol dimethyl ether. Aust. J.

Chem. 26,183(1973) gives a synthesis from 3,5-         dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylbenzylamine in 7 steps (but perhaps only 4 will          reach a cpd. that can give an active THC analog).</p>
