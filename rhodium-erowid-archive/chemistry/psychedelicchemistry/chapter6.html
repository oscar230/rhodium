          <h1>Muscimole and Other Isoxazoles</h1>

        <p>It appears likely that mushrooms were the source of man's first psychedelic experiences. The &quot;soma&quot; praised in the Rig Veda of ancient India (about 2,000 BC) is now thought to be a mushroom (the fly agaric, Amanita muscaria, and possibly other Amanita species). Much of the Eurasian religion and mythology may have had its origin in the psychedelic properties of these mushrooms. Probably all members of the genus Amanita are psychedelic, but ingesting them is unwise since there is probably not a great difference between the psychedelic and lethal dose of mushroom for some species. Amanita muscaria itself is seldom lethal but be very careful if you eat it. It is said to be active if dried, powdered, and smoked. In the USA it fruits in early summer and again in late summer (in fall and winter on the Pacific coast). Since muscimole is very water soluble, it can be extracted from the dried, powdered mushroom (or perhaps even fresh ones) by soaking in water (hot or even boiling water may be OK) and straining &ugrave;&ugrave; but drink cautiously. Most of the muscimole is contained in the red &quot;skin&quot; and the underlying yellow tissue. Some Russian peoples regarded thorough drying of Amanita as a necessary preliminary to ingestion. It has recently been suggested that there are significant chemical differences between New and Old World A. muscaria.</p>
        <p>        The main psychedelic component of these mushrooms appears to be muscimole (5-aminomethyl-3-OH-isoxazole), which is active in an oral dose of about 10 mg. See HCA 48,920(1965) for extraction of muscimole from the fungus.</p>
        <p>        The value of muscimole as a psychedelic is diminished by the dizziness and muscle twitching which seem to occur (at least in some people), but a small dose in conjunction with another psychedelic should be very interesting. Ibotenic acid also occurs in Amanita, and though not itself a desirable psychedelic, it can be converted to muscimole by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide or refluxing in water.</p>
        <p>        Its synthesis is generally more difficult than that of muscimole (see CA 65,2266(1966) and CPB 15,1025(1967), 19,46(1971)). Several routes for the synthesis of muscimole (also called agarin or pantherine) follow. For a good review of this subject see Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 27,262(1969). Muscimole is probably legal everywhere.</p>
        <h3>                            Muscimole Synthesis</h3>
        <h3>Method 1 Rend. Ist. Lomb. 93A,150(1959), 94A, 735(1960), JCS 172(1968)</h3>

Add 100 ml n-butyllithium in hexane (2 moles) with stirring over twenty minutes below -65&oslash; to 22.6 g (III) in 100 ml dry tetrahydrofuran. Stir at -75&oslash; one hour and pour onto a stirred mixture of 1 kg dry ice (solid CO2) and 1 L ether. Let stand twelve hours or until CO2 evaporates and extract with 3x200 ml 2N NaOH. Acidify with dilute HCl and extract with 3x100 ml ether. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the extract to get 25 g 3-methoxy-isoxazole-5-acetic acid (1V) (re-crystallize-petroleum ether-ethyl acetate). Dissolve 5.2 g (IV) in 100 ml 3% HCl in methanol and reflux three hours. Evaporate in vacuum and recrystallize-petroleum ether (or dissolve residual oil in ether, wash with NaHCO3 and dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get 4.5 g of the methyl ester (V) (can distill 80/0.1 ). Add 6.5 g (V) in 20 ml methanol to 3 g hydrazine hydrate in 20 ml methanol and reflux four hours. Evaporate in vacuum and dry in exsiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid for twelve hours to get 6 g 3-methoxy-isoxazole-5-acetohydrazide (VI) (recrystallize-ethyl acetate).

        <p>        Pass chlorine gas into an ice cold, well-stirred solution of 5 ml acetylketene in 30 ml CCl4 until there is a 4.5 g increase in weight (solution is slightly yellow). Pour slowly into excess methanol or ethanol at 0&oslash; and distill at 118/17 to get 6 ml methyl (or ethyl)-4-Cl-acetoacetate (I). To 2.7 ml methanol saturated with dry HCl at 0&oslash;, add a mixture of 10 g (I), 20 g methyl orthoformate (trimethoxymethane) and 13 g methanol and reflux four hours.

Dissolve 30.7 g (II) and 27 g KOH in 500 ml methanol and stir two hours at 140&oslash;. Cool, add 1.5 L water and extract with 3X 1.5 L ether. Can decolorize aqueous solution by boiling briefly with carbon, then filtering and acidifying with concentrated HCl. Filter and recrystallize-benzene to get 3-methoxy-isoxazole-5-COOH, which is the analog of (IV) in method 1 and is identical to (II) in method 3 and can be converted to muscimole by either method.</p>
        <h3>                  Method 5 Rend. Ist. Lomb. 94A,737(1960)</h3>
        <p>        This method gives a somewhat lower yield than method 1. Dissolve 14.1 g 1-nitro-3-butanone in 30 ml glacial acetic acid and heat to 35&oslash;; add slowly with stirring to a solution of 5.3 g bromine in 10 ml glacial acetic acid. Evaporate in vacuum, dissolve residue in ether and wash with water, NaHCO3 and water. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the ether (can distill 84/2) to get 6 g 1-nitro-4-Br-3- butanone (I). Add 4.4 g (I) to 25 ml 48% HBr and reflux three hours. Add 50 ml water and steam distill. Neutralize the distillate with K carbonate and extract with ether.

Can add tetraethylamine to precipitate.</p>
        <h3>         Method 6 (best yield) CPB 19,46(1971), JCS 121,1638(1922)</h3>
        <p>        To prepare diethylacetone dicarboxylate (I) proceed as in method 3 for cocaine synthesis, substituting 720 ml ethanol for methanol. To 197 g (I), add rapidly with stirring and cooling 208 g PCl5, keeping temperature below 50&oslash;. When HCl evolution stops, pour into water and add ice as necessary to cool. Extract the red oil with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum. Boil residue 2 1/2 hours with 20% HCl, evaporate the water and dissolve the residue in ether. Dry and evaporate in vacuum to get 100 g 3-Cl-glutaconate (II). 100 g (II), 300 g ethanol, 50 ml sulfuric acid and reflux while passing in ethanol vapor until 1.5 L collects.
