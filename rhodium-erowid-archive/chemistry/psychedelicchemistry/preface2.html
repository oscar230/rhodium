        <p>The scenario for the psychedelic revolution was completed in the late sixties and nothing surprising has emerged since. Though the vast majority of substances discussed here are clearly relatively harmless and have tremendous potential for medical and psychological therapies as well as for facilitating personal growth, there has been only a feeble trickle of official research on them. This is due to the anti-drug laws, coupled with the cowardice and stupidity of officialdom that is almost invariable. One exception is Grof's superb book delimiting the parameters of psychedelic psychotherapy (REALMS OF THE HUMAN UNCONSCIOUS), but for the most part the field has been abandoned to unofficial research.        I have included much new material that has come to my attention since the first edition of this book, but with the field of organic chemistry growing as it is, there are undoubtedly syntheses that have eluded me. I would appreciate readers calling attention to these.        I am indebted to Gyna Parthenos and her manuscript A NEW METHOD OF LSD PRODUCTION (unpublished) for some of the intriguing new material in the LSD chapter.</p>
