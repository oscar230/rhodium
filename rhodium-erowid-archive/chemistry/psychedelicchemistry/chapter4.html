          <h1>Mescaline and Friends</h1>
          by Michael Valentine Smith
</center>
      <hr>

        
        <p>Mescaline and related alkaloids are found in varying amounts in cacti of the genera Lophophora, Cymnacalycium, Stensonia, Mammillaria, Ariocarbus, Obuntia, Trichocereus, Pelecyphora, and probably others. Members of the Native American Church do quite well with the dried cactus, but extraction of mescaline is desirable since the pure compound seems to produce fewer unpleasant side effects (e.g., nausea). For an excellent review on the occurrence and chemistry of the mescaline type compounds, see JPS 59, 1699(1970) (cf. JPS 60,655(1971)). Various species of these cacti occur in southwestern U.S. as well as Central and South America and have been used by the Aztecs and others for millennia. For a good review of peyote see Lloydia 36, 1-58(1973).</p>
        <h3>		    Extraction of Mescaline from Cactus 		 JACS 88,4218( 1966), Lloydia 29,318(1966)</h3>
        <p>	Dry and grind the top of the cactus and add 50 g to 250 ml methanol and let soak one day. Filter and add 100 ml 1N HCl to the wet powder and let stand about two hours. Meanwhile, evaporate in vacuum the methanol. Filter the HCl solution until clear and add to the residue remaining from the methanol. Make pH about 7 with 2N KOH and add 100 ml CHCl3. Shake in separatory funnel and separate the bottom CHCl3 layer. Add 40 ml water to the CHCl3 and shake in separatory funnel. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the CHCl3 layer to get the mescaline (and other compounds).</p>
        <p>	The most detailed directions for cactus extraction are contained in PSYCHEDELIC GUIDE TO THE PREPARATION OF THE EUCHARIST by R. Brown, obtainable for $5.50 from L.S.l. Co., PO Box 4374, Austin, TX 78765.</p>
        <p>	Another source pressure cooked the peyote in acidic water 15 minutes at 15 lbs. and poured off the liquid. This process was repeated 5 more times and the combined water extracts evaporated slowly to a tar which is cooled until able to be formed into small pills. The pills are dipped in Salol (phenyl salicylate), which has been liquefied by heating, and allowed to dry. This forms an enteric coating which is said to allow ingestion without nausea. Others merely put the tar in gelatin capsules. Either way the nausea of whole peyote is greatly diminished. Three or four tabs are supposed to have the impact of 15-20 buttons.</p>
        <h3>Methoxyphenethylamines and Derivatives</h3>
        <p>	Of the nineteen possible methoxyphenethylamines, only three are known to be psychedelic in man at reasonable doses. These are the 3,4,5-trimethoxy-(mescaline), 2,3,4,5 and 2,3,4,5,6 compounds. There are, however, a vast number of possible psychedelic derivatives with methyl, ethyl, Br, and other groups replacing methoxy groups. In addition, innumerable amphetamine derivatives which closely resemble mescaline in their structure and psychedelic properties have been synthesized. This similarity can be seen in the structures of mescaline and 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine.</p>
        <p>	These amphetamine derivatives have the advantage that they are almost all more active than mescaline, STP being about 80x more active (i.e., requiring only about 5 mg as contrasted with about 400 mg for mescaline), and that they are often easier to synthesize. They do, however, seem to produce somewhat more of the effects of speed (e.g., anxiety, restlessness, sweating) than mescaline. The methylenedioxy compounds, on the other hand, produce some of the mildest trips of any psychedelic.</p>
        <p>	2-5,dimethoxy-4-Br-amphetamine (prepared by bromination of 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine -- see JCS 200(1953)) is about ten times more active than STP but it produces a trip similar to that of MDA and is not truly hallucinogenic. The phenethylamine analogs of this compound and of STP are ten times less potent than the corresponding amphetamines and produce only MDA type effects without the intense sensory alterations. Beta-hydroxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenylethyl amine is said to be a very fine trip.</p>
        <p>	When the amino group of amphetamine is methylated, one gets methamphetamine which is considerably more stimulating. The corresponding hallucinogenic analogs of methamphetamine have not yet been shown to have any special stimulating properties, having on the contrary less potency than the unmethylated forms (see JMC 13,134(1970)), but human tests should be done (preliminary results show these compounds to be very pleasant).</p>
        <p>	N-methyl-MDA is extremely pleasant, producing more euphoria than cocaine, lasting much longer and having a very easy down. N,N-dimethylation or N-ethylation diminish activity drastically and the latter appears to have sedative effects. The methylenedioxy compounds are generally free of marked visual changes, allow considerable voluntary control of the experience and are more potent than the dimethoxy counterparts.</p>
        <p>	It is probably best to avoid p-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (STP), the former because it seems to have a high toxicity and the latter because it lasts too long (e.g., 24 hours for a minimum dose). Other 4-alkyl amphetamines also seem to be toxic. A number of apparent fatalities due to MDA have been noted, but the reports usually involve very large amounts, often in combination with other drugs (e.g., 7 g MDA plus barbiturates) and screening for other, more toxic drugs (in particular, PMA) has not been done.</p>
        <p>	These amphetamine analogs can be produced by using the appropriately substituted benzaldehyde in place of 3,4,5-tri&ugrave; methoxy-benzaldehyde, and nitroethane in place of nitro-methane in the aldehyde method for mescaline synthesis (using nitropropane, etc., to give a longer chain results in less activity). However, easier synthetic routes from the naturally occurring (therefore cheap and commercially available) ring substituted propenylbenzenes are given here.</p>
        <p>	The following table lists common names, position of ring substitution, and approximate activity of the amphetamine derivatives for some readily available allyl and propenyl benzenes (see J. Chromatography 30,54(1967) for further information on these compounds). Activity is relative to mescaline which equals 1 (an activity of 12 means a dose of about 25 mg). Parentheses indicate a methylenedioxy bridge; other substituents are methoxy groups.<br>

        <h3>Amphetamines from Allylbenzenes JACS 91,5648(1969)</h3>
        <p>	To a cooled and stirred solution of 100 ml acetonitrile and 64.8 g mercuric nitrate, add slowly 0.2M of the allylbenzene (keep temperature below 30&oslash;). Stir one hour at room temperature, cool and add 200 ml 3N NaOH, then 200 ml 0.5M NaBH4 in 3N NaOH. After one hour saturate the water layer with NaCl and extract with ether. Dry and evaporate in vacuum the extract to get the N-acetyl-amphetamines. This procedure may not work with the propenylbenzenes. 	If it is desired to remove the N-acetyl group see CJC 51,1407 (1973).</p>
        <h3>	    Amphetamines from Propenylbenzenes CA 52,11965(1958)</h3>
        <p>	Use of N-methyl-formamide in place of formamide will give the corresponding N-methyl-amphetamine which is nicer. Exemplified for 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). To a cooled mixture of 34 g 30% H202 and 150 g formic acid, add dropwise a solution of 32.4 g (0.2M) isosafrole in 120 ml acetone (keep temperature below 40&oslash;). Let stand about twelve hours and evaporate in vacuum. Add 60 ml methanol and 360 g 15% sulfuric acid to the residue and heat on water bath three hours. Cool, extract with ether or benzene and evaporate in vacuum the extract to give 20 g 3,4-methlenedioxybenzyl-methyl ketone (I) (can distill 115/2). Add 23 g (I) to 65 g formamide and heat at 190&oslash; for five hours. Cool, add 100 ml H2O, extract with benzene and evaporate in vacuum the extract. Add 8 ml methanol and 75 ml 15% HCl to residue, heat on water bath two hours and evaporate in  vacuum (or basify with KOH and extract the oil with benzene and dry,  evaporate in vacuum) to get about 11 g MDA. In this, as in the other syntheses,  either the cis or trans (alpha or beta) propenylbenzenes (or a mixture) may be used.</p>
        <h3>	     Amphetamines from Probenylbenzenes JMC 9,445(1966)</h3>
        <p>	If the allyl isomer is at hand, it must first be converted to the propenyl as follows (CJC 43,3437(1965)): Add equal weights of the allyl compound and KOH flakes, and absolute ethanol and heat on steam bath or reflux for twenty-four hours; dry and evaporate in vacuum or add two times the volume of water and extract with ether or methylene chloride and dry, evaporate in vacuum (recrystallize-hexane).</p>
        <p>	0.034M propenylbenzene in a mixture of 3.3 g pyridine and 41 g dry acetone is cooled to 0&oslash; and 6.9 g tetranitro-methane added over one minute with vigorous stirring, and stirring continued for two minutes. Add 2.2 g KOH in 40 ml water, add more water and extract the nitropr&#148;pene with methylene chloride and dry, evaporate in vacuum (recrystallize-methanol). The nitropropenes (which seem to have little activity themselves) can be reduced to the active amphetamines with lithium aluminum hydride or Zn-Hg as described later, or reduced by another method (hydroboration, hydrogenation, Na-ethanol, electrolytic, etc.).</p>
        <h3>       Mescaline and Amphetamines from Styrenes and Propenylbenzenes 			     JACS 86,3565(1964)</h3>
        <p>	The yield of mescaline should be about 50%; that for amphetamines will vary. 0.1 M of ring substituted styrene or propenylbenzene in 30 ml tetrahydrofuran in 1/2 L flask. Flush with N2 and add 33 ml 1 M borane in tetrahydrofuran (see procedure below for preparation). Stir one hour, add 3 ml water and 50 ml 3N NaOH, and then 215 ml 0.31 M fresh chloramine solution (prepared by treating dilute aqueous NH4OH with Na hypochlorite at O&oslash;; see BER 40,4586 (1907)). Keep at room temperature one hour, acidify with HCl, extract with ether, basify with NaOH and extract with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum (or just basify and extract with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get the amine. To prepare the diborane in tetrahydrofuran, add 0.3 M NaBH4 (or LiBH4) and 0.4 M BF3 in total 200 ml tetrahydrofuran and keep dry in refrigerator, or generate the diborane in the reaction flask as follows: To a well-stirred suspension of 3.4 g NaBH4 in 150 ml tetrahydrofuran and 0.3M of the styrene or propenylbenzene, add over one hour at room temperature, 15.1 ml BF3 in ether in 20 ml tetrahydrofuran (keep temperature at room temperature); let stand one hour at room temperature and decompose the excess hydride with water; then add the NaOH and chloramine (or hydroxyl-amino-O-sulfonic acid) and proceed as above to get the amine.</p>

        <p>	Styrenes will give phenethylamines, 1-propenylbenzenes will give amphetamines. The tetrahydrofuran should be dried over KOH pellets and, if desired, distilled from sodium then from lithium aluminum hydride. The diglyme can be vacuum distilled from calcium hydride and stored with calcium hydride. Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid can be purchased or prepared (LAC 702,131 (1967); Inorg. Synth. 5,122(1957)). To a 3-necked flask flushed with a nitrogen stream add 0.096M styrene or 1-propenylbenzene in 200 ml diglyme, and then a solution of 1.52 g (0.04M) NaBH4 in 70 ml diglyme. Keep the temperature at 25&oslash; and add with stirring over 1/2 hour 7.3 g (0.052M) 48% BF3 etherate. Let temperature rise over 3 hours and then reflux 3 hours. Cool and carefully add 11.86 g (0.105M) hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid dissolved in 50 ml diglyme. Reflux 3 hours, cool and take up in 10% HCl. Extract with ether, basify the cold acid phase with excess NaOH, extract with chloroform, and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get about 40% yield of the amine.</p>

        <p>	Add 0.44 moles ring substituted phenylacetate, 100 g acetic anhydride and 30 g sodium acetate and heat at 145-150&oslash; for 18 hours to get ca. 0.4 moles of the methyl-phenylacetate (I). Add (I) and formamide (or N-methyl-formamide for the N-methyl cpd.), heat 4-5 hours at 180-195&oslash;, cool and extract with CHCl3. Evaporate in vacuum, dissolve residue in 40% sulfuric acid and heat at 90-125&oslash; for 5-6 hours. Neutralize and add solid NaOH to precipitate about 50% amphetamine. Treat with 10% sulfuric acid to get the sulfate.</p>

Mix 25 g 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetone, 9.3 g hydroxyl-amine-HCl, 15.6 g K-acetate and 400 ml 70% ethanol and reflux 3 1/2 hours. Evaporate in vacuum and extract the residue with 4x150 ml benzene. Wash combined extracts with 2x75 ml water; dry and evaporate in vacuum the benzene (can purify the oil by dissolving in benzene and precipitate by adding petroleum ether) to get out 20 g precipitate (test for activity). Dissolve 18.1 g precipitate in 200 ml methanol and hydrogenate. Acidify to get about 15 g (I).</p>

Add dropwise over four hours 75 ml 20% sulfuric acid with stirring. Let stand eight hours; filter and wash precipitate with water, ether, ethanol, and dry. Dissolve 10 g precipitate in 60 ml 8% K carbonate in ethanol with stirring and gentle (below 30&oslash;) heating. Add 150 g ice, acidify with 100 ml dilute HCl and let stand one-half hour at O&oslash;. Filter, wash with water and dry to get about 7 g yellow crystals (recrystallize-methanol) (2-nitropropenylbenzene). Add 4 g crystals to 100 ml ethanol and 50 ml glacial acetic acid; then add 10 ml concentrated HCl or 50 ml concentrated sulfuric acid for the catholyte in a 40 cm2 Hg-cathode in a porous cell surrounded by 3N sulfuric acid anolyte with a water cooled lead anode and reduce at 4 amps (about 0.07 amps/cm2 cathode surface) at 30-40&oslash; for twenty hours or until solution is colorless. Evaporate in vacuum to about 20 ml; cool with ice, basify with NaOH and extract with ether. Wash, dry and dilute the ether (or dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get (I).</p>

        <p>	This is a rapid, convenient procedure. If trimethoxybenzyl alcohol is used in place of p-anisyl alcohol, mescaline will result. Shake 100 g p-anisyl alcohol (or 0.72 moles analog) with 500 ml concentrated HCl for 2 minutes. Wash the organic phase with water, 5% NaHCO3 and water, and then add over 40 minutes to a stirred slurry of 49 g NaCN in 400 ml dimethylsulfoxide with ice water cooling to keep temperature at 35-40&oslash;. After completing addition, remove cooling bath, stir for 90 minutes and then add to 300 ml water. Separate the small upper layer and extract the aqueous-DMSO layer with 2x100 ml ether. Add the ether extracts to the small upper layer, wash once with water and dry (MgSO4). Add 600 ml ether to a dry flask and chill in ice as 80 g of anhydrous AlCl3, is added portionwise, followed by 23 g of lithium aluminum hydride. Add the washed and dried ether extracts at such a rate as to give gentle reflux without external heat (ca. 1 hour). Stir for 2 hours, ice chill and treat dropwise with 25 ml water then 250 ml 20% aqueous NaOH, with periodic addition of ether through the condenser to replenish losses and facilitate stirring. Filter and wash precipitate with ether; add ether to filtrate and mix with one third its volume of absolute ethanol. Slowly and with continuous swirling and ice cooling add 60 ml concentrated HCl. Cool to 0&oslash; and filter to get the amine hydrochloride in ca. 75% overall yield (or can obtain the crude amine by filtering and drying, evaporating in vacuum the final ether solution). Note the use of concentrated HCl to obtain the crystalline end product in contrast to many other papers which employ HCl gas.</p>
        <h3>	   N-Methylation of Amines JMC 13,134(1970), 15,214(1972)</h3>
        <p>	Either phenethylamine or phenylisopropylamine will work. If the hydrochloride salt is available, this should first be changed to the free amine by stirring with concentrated aqueous NaOH.</p>
        <p>	Treat 0.54 moles of the amine with 100 ml of benzene and 70 g of benzaldehyde in a flask fitted with a Dean-Stark trap and reflux until no more water is present in the condensate (ca. 1 hour) (alternatively, reflux 1/2 hour and then distill until the temperature reaches 100&oslash;): remove the trap and add a solution of 82 g dimethylsulfate in 200 ml benzene through the condenser at a rate sufficient to maintain reflux (ca. 15 minutes). Reflux 30 minutes (or heat 90 minutes on a steam bath), add 200 ml water and reflux (or heat on steam bath) for 1/2 hour more. Separate the aqueous layer, extract it twice with ether or benzene, basify with 50% NaOH and extract twice more. Add the extracts to the organic layer and dry, evaporate in vacuum to get ca. 70% yield of the N-methyl-amine. Can crystallize by dissolving in 500 ml 20% absolute ethanol-ether and treating with 50 ml concentrated HCl while swirling and cooling. The crystals can be further purified by washing with ice cold 20% ethanol-ether and recrystallizing from ethanol.</p>
        <p>	N-methylation of hallucinogenic amphetamines seems to produce a very smooth, mellow, euphoric trip, and the same is probably true for phenylethylamines. 	For N-methylation via the imides see JOC 38, I 348(1973). N-methylation appears to decrease the potency. Larger N-alkyl groups seem to have a sedative action.</p>
        <h3>		    N,N-Dimethylamines JMC 13,134(1970)</h3>
        <p>	To 14 g formic acid, cooled in an ice water bath, add dropwise 0.016 mole of the amine and then 3.6 g of formaldehyde (ca.10 ml of formalin) and reflux for 5 hours. Cool to room temperature, add 7 ml concentrated HCl and evaporate in vacuum. The resulting oily dimethylamine can be purified by dissolving in 25 ml water, extracting with 2x25 ml CHCl3. Basify the aqueous layer with 2N NaOH and extract with 3x25 ml ether, and proceed as described above for the N-methylamines. This procedure should work for both phenethylamines and phenylisopropylamines, and should affect the trip similarly to N-monomethylation. See the following method for another easy route to N-alkylation which will probably work for dialkylation. Although N,N dialkyl compounds have very little activity, they are probably worth further investigation.</p>

        <p>	Note that the following procedure leads from the aldehyde to the amine or N-substituted amine without involving a troublesome catalytic hydrogenation for reducing the intermediate nitropropene. Mix 0.25M substituted benzaldehyde, 0.3M nitroethane, 50 ml dry toluene and 5 ml n-butylamine (or other amine), and reflux 3 hours with a Dean-Stark trap (or prepare the nitro-propene as described elsewhere here). Add 50 g iron powder and 1 g FeCl3 (optional) and reflux while adding 90 ml concentrated HCl over 3 hours. Reflux 1 hour more, add 2 liters of water and extract 3 times with ether, then dry and evaporate in vacuum (or steam distill until about 3.5 liters of distillate is obtained; extract the distillate 3 times with toluene; wash the toluene layers with 7 g NaHSO3 in 225 ml of water, then 3 times with water and dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get the ketone. Mix 0.13M ketone, 28 g formamide (or dimethyl-formamide if the N,N-dimethylamine is desired) and 3 ml formic acid and heat at 160&oslash;. Add 3 more ml formic acid and heat 16 hours at 170-180&oslash; adding formic acid from time to time to keep the pH acid. Distill off the water formed (about 16 ml), cool and extract with 3x70 ml benzene. Distill off the benzene and reflux the residue 7 hours with 30 ml concentrated HCl. Chill, basify with 10% NaOH and extract with 3X70 ml ether. Dry and evaporate the ether in vacuum to get the amine. Since some amines are unstable to heating, it is perhaps best just to dry and evaporate the benzene extract.</p>
        <p>	To obtain an N-substituted amine reflux 0.1 M ketone, 17 g aluminum filings or foil, 50 ml ethanol, 40 ml 30% aqueous n-butylamine (or other amine), and 0.5 g of mercuric chloride for 3 hours. Cool and pour on 500 g crushed ice and 200 ml 10% KOH. Extract 3 times with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum (or wash combined ether layers 2 times with 1O% HCl, basify acid extract with 15% NaOH and extract 3 times with ether and dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get the n-butyl-amine (or other amine).</p>

        <p>        Simple methods of preparing phenylacetonitrile from diazoacetonitrile and triphenylboron are given in JACS 90,6891 (1968) and from the borophenyl-9-borabicyclo (3.3.1) nonane (BBN) and Cl-acetonitrile in JACS 91,6854(1969). These methods should work with substituted phenyl compounds to give mescaline and analogs. Likewise (JACS 90,5936(1968)), a preparation of phenylketones from triphenylboron or BBN and diazoacetone, or bromo-acetone (JACS 91,6852( 1969)) may be used to prepare the phenylacetones which can be reduced to the amphetamines in one step as already described. For synthesis of BBN see JACS 91,4304(1969) and for borabicyclononane see JACS 90,5280(1968). The amphetamine and mescaline analogs which can be obtained by replacing carbon atoms with O, N, or S atoms may also be active, but little work has been done on this.
