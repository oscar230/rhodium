<p> 5-Bromoprotocatechualdehyde (<strong>11</strong>) was obtained from 5-bromovanillin<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> quantitatively by applying the method which Lange<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> reported for the cleavage of various alkyl o-hydroxyphenyl ethers.
This bromoaldehyde (<strong>11</strong>) was treated with methylene iodide in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate to give 5-bromopiperonal (<strong>12</strong>) in 38.8% yield.
The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 5-bromopiperonal (<strong>12</strong>) with performic acid gave 5-bromosesamol (<strong>13</strong>), mp 102-104�C, in 78.8% yield, accompanied by a small amount (0.6%) of 5-bromopiperonylic acid (<strong>14</strong>).
Methylation of 5-bromosesamol (<strong>13</strong>) in the usual way gave 1-bromo-5-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene (<strong>15</strong>), mp 49-51�C, in 96.5% yield.
Treatment of this methoxybenzene (<strong>15</strong>) with phosphorus oxychloride and dimethylformamide (DMF) gave 2-bromo-6-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (<strong>16</strong>), mp 208-209�C, as the sole product in 91.5% yield.</p>

<p>The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the aldehyde (<strong>16</strong>) with performic acid afforded 2-bromo-6-methoxy- 3,4-methylenedioxyphenol (<strong>22</strong>), mp 128-129�C, in 72.9% yield, which was converted to 1-bromo-2,3-dimethoxy- 5,6-methylenedioxybenzene (<strong>23</strong>), mp 78-79�C, by methylation with diazomethane in 97.9% yield or with dimethyl sulfate and 50% sodium hydroxide solution in methanol in 96.3% yield.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
<p><strong>5-Bromopiperonal</strong> (<strong>12</strong>)</p>

<p>A mixed solution of bromoprotocatechualdehyde<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> (<strong>11</strong>) (20.0 g; mp 225-230�C), CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> (49.7 g), and anhydrous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (35.5 g) in DMSO (61.5 ml) was heated at 60�C for 32 hr in a nitrogen stream, and poured into a large quantity of water. The precipitate was filtered off and purified by column chromatography on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Brockmann) using CHCl<sub>3</sub> as solvent to give colourless needles (14.5 g), mp 124-126�C (lit.<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> mp 120�C; lit.<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> mp 124-125�C).</p>


<p><strong>5-Bromosesamol</strong> (<strong>13</strong>)</p>

<p>To 85% HCOOH (80 ml) was added 35% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (24 g) under ice cooling. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. A solution of 5-bromopiperonal (<strong>12</strong>) (35.32 g) in 98% HCOOH (740 ml) was added to the solution of performic acid below 10�C and stirred at 0�C for 4 hr. After decomposition of the excess peracid by addition of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (35 g), the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and extracted with ether. The ether solution was washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> aq., added to 5% NaOH aq. (500 ml) with vigorous stirring and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The aqueous layer was made acidic with 10% HCl aq. and extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Recrystallization of the residue from benzene-hexane gave colourless needles (26.4 g), mp 102-104�C.</p>

<p>Acidification of the saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution gave 5-bromopiperonylic acid (<strong>14</strong>) (0.28 g), mp 250-252�C (lit.<a href="5-bromopiperonal.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> mp 253�C).</p>


<p><strong>1-Bromo-5-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene</strong> (<strong>15</strong>)</p>

<p>To a solution of 5-bromosesamol (<strong>13</strong>) (6.00 g) in MeOH (16 ml) containing dimethyl sulfate (3.15 ml) was added 2 N NaOH aq. (52 ml) at room temperature. The mixture was kept at room temperature and addition of the same amounts of dimethyl sulfate and 2 N NaOH aq. was repeated three more times, monitoring by TLC. Finally, after further addition of 2 N NaOH aq. (50 ml), the mixture was refluxed for 30 min, cooled and extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Distillation of the residue at 109�C (1.5 mmHg) gave an oily substance (6.17 g) which crystallized when kept in a refrigerator. Recrystallization of a portion of the crystalline from hexane gave colorless needles, mp 49-51�C.</p>


<p><strong>2-Bromo-6-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde</strong> (<strong>16</strong>)</p>

<p>Phosphorus oxychloride (15 ml) was added over 1 hr to a solution of the methoxybenzene (<strong>15</strong>) (25.5g) in dry DMF (25 ml) under ice cooling. After addition, the mixture was heated at 60�C for 3 hr, poured into ice-water, made alkaline with 5% NaOH aq. and filtered. Recrystallization of the precipitate from EtOH or CHCl<sub>3</sub>/hexane gave colourless needles (26.2 g), mp 208-209�C.</p>


<p><strong>2-Bromo-6-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenol</strong> (<strong>22</strong>)</p>

<p>After addition of 35% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5.7 g) to 85% HCOOH (19.4 ml) at 0�C, the mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr, and cooled again to 0�C. A solution of 2-bromo-6-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (<strong>16</strong>) (7.7 g) in 98% HCOOH (310 ml) was gradually added to the cooled performic acid solution at 0-5�C and then stirred at 0-5�C for 5 hr. After decomposition of the excess peracid by addition of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (7.7 g), the reaction mixture was diluted with an equal volume of water and extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was washed with saturated NaCl aq. and then saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> aq. After addition of a 5% NaOH aq. to the ethereal solution, the two layers were vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. The ethereal solution was separated from the 5% NaOH aq. and washed with 5% NaOH aq. The original 5% NaOH aq. and washings were combined, made acidic with 17% HCl aq., and extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to give colourless prisms (5.35 g), mp 128-129�C, which were recrystallized from EtOH. The ethereal solution separated from the 5% NaOH aq. was dried over anhydrous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and evaporated to give unchanged starting aldehyde (<strong>16</strong>) (250 mg).</p>


<p><strong>1-Bromo-2,3-dimethoxy-5,6-methylenedioxybenzene</strong> (<strong>23</strong>)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li><span class="oli"><strong>Using Diazomethane:</strong><br>A solution of CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (nitrosomethyl urea: 600 mg) in ether (5 ml) was added to a solution of the phenol (<strong>22</strong>) (164 mg) in MeOH (1 ml). The mixed solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min and evaporated to give colourless needles (175 mg), mp 78-79�C, which were recrystallized from benzene-hexane.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli"><strong>Using Dimethyl Sulfate:</strong><br>
  To a solution of the phenol (<strong>22</strong>) (9.5 g) in MeOH (50 ml) containing dimethyl sulfate (16 ml) was added 50% NaOH aq. (10 ml). After the reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 1 hr, another 50% NaOH aq. (10 ml) was added. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, poured into a large quantity of water and extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was washed with 5% NaOH aq., dried over anhydrous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and evaporated. The residue (9.56g), mp 78-79�C, was identical with the sample prepared by treatment with CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>.</span></li>
