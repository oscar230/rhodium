<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The instant invention relates to a novel process for the synthesis of
     amphetamine, methamphetamine, and related compounds from derivatives of
     phenylpropanolamine acid addition salts. This new process, applied to
     produce d-amphetamine, has several advantages over prior art d-amphetamine
     production routes: shorter cycle times, less labor-intensive steps, and
     better chemical hygiene. Certain combinations of pharmaceutically
     acceptable salts of d,l-amphetamine and d-amphetamine are useful in the
     treatment of attention deficit disorders.
<BR><BR>Many methods of making amphetamine and related compounds are known in the
     prior art, including the commercially used Leukart-Wallach reaction for
     producing racemic amphetamine from phenylacetone. For example, in one
     commercial process, phenylacetone is reacted with formamide and formic
     acid to form (.+-.)-N-formylamphetamine (racemic N-formylamphetamine). The
     racemic N-formylamphetamine is then hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid, the
     solution basified, and the resulting d,l-amphetamine ((.+-.)-amphetamine;
     racemic amphetamine) is distilled with an overall yield of about 60%.
<BR><BR>In the illegal syntheses of amphetamine and related compounds, such as
     those found on internet searches, phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine,
     isolated from over-the-counter cough and cold products, are converted to
     amphetamine and methamphetamine respectively (see, for example, Otto Snow,
     Amphetamine Synthesis (Thoth Press: Spring Hill, Fla., 1998);
     http://www.hyperreal.org/drugs/synthesis/meth.synth.; or
     http://hive.lycaeum.org/book-store.htm/). Following one of the procedures
     used in illegal manufacture of amphetamine and related compounds,
     d,l-norephedrine was refluxed with hydriodic acid and red phosphorus to
     obtain a mixture of amphetamine and a compound believed to be a bis
     compound, 1-phenyl-2-(phenylisopropyl)aminopropane, in equal parts. By
     another procedure, heating norephedrine with thionyl chloride at reflux
     temperature, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the resulting
     2-amino-1-chloro-1-phenylpropane hydrochloride, gave amphetamine. To avoid
     the hazards of working with thionyl chloride, hydriodic acid, and red
     phosphorus, another route was desirable. The conversion of the hydroxyl
     group of phenylpropanolamine to a benzylic acyloxyester followed by
     removal by hydrogenolysis, the process of the instant invention, was
     investigated and found to be a good route. These three discrete synthetic
     routes are summarized in the examples of Scheme 1, with a process of the
     invention illustrated as the bottom pathway. In this Scheme, amphetamine
     is used for illustration only, these synthetic routes are applicable to
     related compounds with substitution patterns obvious to those skilled in
     the art.
     ##STR3##
<BR><BR>Currently, dextroamphetamine is obtained from racemic amphetamine through a
     lengthy, labor-intensive process. It is obtained in 23% yield from racemic
     amphetamine via tartrate salt resolution followed by basification and
     distillation. In the tartrate salt resolution step, a hot solution of 37%
     hydrochloric acid, methanol, tartaric acid, and the racemic amphetamine is
     drained from a reactor into stainless steel pots, and the hot mixture is
     allowed to cool undisturbed for 16 hours while the d-amphetamine tartrate
     salt predominantly crystallizes. The solvent is then decanted from each of
     the stainless steel pots and the recovered d-amphetamine tartrate salt is
     transferred by hand to a centrifuge, where the salt is spun dry,
     reslurried with methanol, and centrifuged dry again. The tartrate
     resolution step is then repeated until the salt obtained meets the melting
     point and optical rotation specifications desired.
<BR><BR>Using the process of the invention, dextroamphetamine (S-(+)-amphetamine)
     can be stereospecifically prepared from a phenylpropanolamine having the S
     configuration at the carbon bearing the amino group, e.g.,
     1R,2S-(-)-norephedrine or 1S,2S-(+)-norpseudoephedrine (the erythro form
     of phenylpropanolamine is norephedrine and the threo form is
     norpseudoephedrine). In the process of the invention, the otherwise higher
     cost of the appropriate phenylpropanolamine diastereomers useful for
     preparing dextroamphetamine is offset by the shorter cycle times, a less
     labor-intensive process, and better chemical hygiene.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The process comprises ester formation and then removal of the benzylic
     acyloxy group by catalytic hydrogenation or catalytic transfer
     hydrogenation. As pointed out above, when it is applied to the production
     of d-amphetamine, the process has several advantages over current
     d-amphetamine production routes: shorter cycle times, less labor-intensive
     steps, and better chemical hygiene. Further optimization of yields and
     operation cycle times using optimization methods known to those skilled in
     the art would only increase these advantages.

<BR><BR>For a direct route to dextroamphetamine, both b 1R,2S-(-)-norephedrine and
     1S,2S-(+)-norpseudoephedrine have the correct steric configuration at the
     carbon bearing the amino group necessary to produce d-amphetamine
     [S-(+)-amphetamine] as shown in Scheme 3. 1R,2S-(-)-norephedrine is
     generally commercially available. This same process produces
     d-methamphetamine starting with either 1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine or
     1S,2S-(+)-pseudoephedrine.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

<BR><BR>EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
<BR><BR>In the following experiments the analytical methods used include
     quantitative and qualitative analyses performed by high performance liquid
     chromatography (HPLC) and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) methods.
<BR><BR>I. Prior Art Synthesis Methods
<BR><BR>For comparison purposes, the two prior art synthesis methods mentioned
     hereinabove were tested and the results obtained.
<BR><BR>1. Iodination of Norephedrine Hydrochloride and Reduction to Amphetamine

<BR><BR>A 100 mL round bottom flask with a magnetic stirrer was charged with 20 mL
     57% Hl solution. (1R,2S)-(-)-norephedrine (10.0 g, 0.066 mol) was then
     added to the flask with stirring. Red phosphorus (1.0 g) was added to the
     stirred mixture and the reaction mixture temperature then increased to
     40.degree. C. within a few minutes. The reaction mixture was then heated
     to 100.degree. C. and samples were withdrawn at intervals for HPLC
     analysis. The results were as follows:
<BR><BR>a. 2 hours (58% norephedrine, 6.8% amphetamine, 6% bis compound);
<BR><BR>b. 4 hours (50% norephedrine, 10.2% amphetamine, 14.7% bis compound);
<BR><BR>c. 6 hours (41% norephedrine, 15.6% amphetamine, 17.7% bis compound); and
<BR><BR>d. 22 hours (48.95% amphetamine, 48.5% bis compound).
<BR><BR>After 22 hours at 100.degree. C., the reaction mixture was cooled and
     filtered to remove the phosphorus. An oily layer separated (1.3 g,
     identified by GLC as bis compound). The aqueous layer was basified with
     50% sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with ether. The ether extract
     was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to obtain 4.1
     g of yellow oil, identified by HPLC as consisting of 83.23% amphetamine
     and 16.27% bis compound). The calculated yield of amphetamine was
     therefore 3.41 g (38.3%)
<BR><BR>2. Preparation of 2-Amino-1-chloro-1-phenylpropane Hydrochloride from
     Norephedrine Hydrochloride and Reduction to Amphetamine

<BR><BR>A 100 mL round bottom flask with a magnetic stirrer was charged with
     thionyl chloride (24.47 g, 15 mL) and norephedrine hydrochloride (5.38 g).
     The mixture was stirred and heated at reflux temperature for about 1 hour
     and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The excess thionyl chloride
     was removed by evaporation on a rotary evaporator. The residue in the
     flask was triturated with ether (50 mL) and the solid collected. The crude
     solid product was recrystallized from methanol-isopropyl ether and the
     purified solid collected (2.83 g, 48%). The purified
     2-amino-1-chloro-1-phenylpropane hydrochloride was then subjected to
     hydrogenolysis as follows. A solution of 2-amino-1-chloro-1-phenylpropane
     hydrochloride (2.38 g, 0.0137 mol) in a mixture of 50 mL ethanol/16 mL
     water was prepared and transferred to a Parr bottle. Under a nitrogen
     atmosphere, a portion of 10% palladium on carbon catalyst was added to the
     solution in the Parr bottle. The Parr bottle was then installed on a Parr
     shaker apparatus and an inert atmosphere produced and maintained in the
     bottle. The Parr bottle was then pressurized with hydrogen to about 50 psi
     and was shaken until the hydrogen uptake ceased. The contents of the Parr
     bottle was filtered to remove the catalyst and the filtrate was evaporated
     under reduced pressure to remove the ethanol. The remaining aqueous
     solution was basified with 50% sodium hydroxide solution. The oily top
     layer with was extracted with ether and the ether layer was separated from
     the aqueous layer. The ether extract was dried with drying agent and
     filtered to remove the drying agent. The filtrate was concentrated to
     obtain crude amphetamine as an oil (1.70 g, 72.3%).
<BR><BR>II. The Process of the Invention
<BR><BR>The process of the invention and experimental results using the process of
     the invention are discussed below. Norephedrine hydrochloride is
     commercially available and was used to illustrate in the reactions useful
     in this process. These conditions can also be applied to ephedrine
     hydrochloride or pseudoephedrine hydrochloride to produce
     d-methamphetamine. Furthermore, those skilled in the art should know to
     apply this process for the preparations of many amphetamine related
     compounds as covered in Scheme 2. Literature procedures for making
     amphetamine and methamphetamine report retention of configuration at the
     carbon bearing the amino group (see, e.g., Noggle, DeRuiter, and Clark, J.
     Chrom. Sci. 25, 38-42 (1987); Allen and Kiser, J. Forensic Sciences 32(4),
     953-962 (1987)). Therefore d,l-norephedrine and d,l-norpseudoephedrine are
     expected to give the same product, d,l-amphetamine, and
     1R,2S-(-)-norephedrine and 1S,2S-(+)-norpseudoephedrine are expected to
     give dextroamphetamine [d-amphetamine, S-(+)-amphetamine]. Also,
     d,l-ephedrine and d,l-pseudoephedrine are expected to give the same
     product, d,l-methamphetamine, and 1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine and
     1S,2S-(+)-pseudoephedrine are expected to give dextromethamphetamine
     [d-methamphetamine, S-(+)-methamphetamine]. Abbreviations used in the
     following tables are NE for norephedrine, O-AcNE for O-acetylnorephedrine,
     N-AcNE for N-acetylnorephedrine, O,N-diAcNE for O,N-diacetylnorephedrine,
     Amp for amphetamine, and N-AcAmp for N-acetylamphetamine. These compounds
     were synthesized and used as references for HPLC analyses.
<BR><BR>A. Preparation of 2-Amino-1-acetoxy1-phenylpropane Hydrochloride
     (O-Acetylnorephedrine) from Norephedrine Hydrochloride

<BR><BR>A three-necked 100 mL round bottom flask equipped with thermocontroller,
     stirrer, condenser, and gas bubbler was charged with 18.77 g (0.10 mol)
     d,l-norephedrine hydrochloride, acetic acid (18 mL), and acetic anhydride
     (12.24 g, 0.12 mol). The reaction mixture was warmed with a heating mantle
     with thermocontroller set for 80.degree. C. After the reaction mixture
     cleared, it was held at 80.degree. C. for 2 hours. Heptane (36 mL) was
     added to the 80.degree. C. reaction mixture slowly with rapid stirring,
     then the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The slurry
     was stirred overnight at ambient temperature and the solid was collected
     by filtration. The granular solid was dried under ambient conditions
     overnight to obtain 18.13 g of product (89.99% yield).
<BR><BR>B. Preparation of 2-Amino-1-acetoxy-1-phenylpropane Hydrochloride
     (O-Acetylnorephedrine) from Norephedrine Hydrochloride and Reduction to
     Amphetamine without Isolation of the Intermediate

<BR><BR>The following method is an example wherein the reduction of the
     intermediate O-acetylnorephedrine is performed without isolating the
     O-acetylnorephedrine.
<BR><BR>A 100 mL 3-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer,
     condenser, and thermocontroller, was charged with d,l-norephedrine
     hydrochloride (9.39 g, 0.050 mol), acetic anhydride (6.12 g, 0.060 mol),
     and acetic acid (18 mL). The reaction mixture is heated with heating
     mantle with a thermocontroller set at 80.degree. C. When the temperature
     reached about 60.degree. C., the reaction mixture became exothermic and
     the temperature rose to 84.degree. C. The reaction mixture was cooled to
     80.degree. C. and held at 80.degree. C. for 2 hours. HPLC analysis of
     reaction mixture at this point showed 90.69% O-acetylnorephedrine and
     6.88% O,N-diacetylnorephedrine. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight
     at ambient temperature and then diluted with 20 mL ethanol. The resulting
     solution was transferred to a Parr bottle, which was purged with nitrogen
     gas and about 1 g of 10% palladium-carbon catalyst (50% water) was added.
     The Parr bottle was installed on a Parr shaker apparatus and inerted with
     nitrogen. The Parr bottle was then pressurized with hydrogen to 45 psi and
     then shaken under hydrogen pressure at ambient temperature. In 10 minutes
     a 3 psi pressure drop was observed. The Parr bottle temperature controller
     was set to 55.degree. C. and the pressure increased from 42 psi to 47 psi.
     The pressure changes over the next 5 to 6 hours were recorded. The heat
     was then turned off and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to
     ambient temperature. The final pressure was recorded and the Parr bottle
     was depressurized and purged with nitrogen gas. The mixture was filtered
     to remove the catalyst and the filtrate was analyzed and found to consist
     of 2.45% norephedrine, 57.59% amphetamine, 20.71% O-acetylnorephedrine,
     10% N-acetylamphetamine, and 3.75% O,N-diacetylnorephedrine. The
     calculated yield was 3.89 g (57%)
<BR><BR>C. Further Examples of Acetylation of Norephedrine Hydrochloride
<BR><BR>As illustrated above, O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride can be prepared in
     good yield from norephedrine hydrochloride by heating with acetic
     anhydride (preferably 1.2 to 2.0 equivalents) in acetic acid (preferably 1
     to 2 mL/g of norephedrine hydrochloride) in a mildly exothermic reaction
     at 50-80.degree. C. for 2 hours, although exothermic reaction temperatures
     could exceed 80.degree. C. Generally, when less than a 20% excess of
     acetic anhydride is used, some unreacted norephedrine remains, for
     example, when a 10% excess of acetic anhydride was used, it reacted with
     only about 80% of the norephedrine hydrochloride. It was found that the
     amount of acetic acid used does not appear to be critical, as the reaction
     proceeded well with either 1 or 2 mL/g of norephedrine hydrochloride and
     could be agitated without difficulty at 1 mL/g. When no acetic acid was
     used, however, the product obtained consisted of a mixture 16.71%
     norephedrine, 67.08% O-acetylnorephedrine, and 14.43%
     O,N-diacetylnorephedrine. Results of other laboratory preparations are
     summarized in Table 1.

<BR><BR>(i). Side Products
<BR><BR>Table 1 lists the side products found in various acetylation experiments.
     Small amounts of unreacted norephedrine and O,N-diacetylnorephedrine, were
     found as side products in the isolated products. The signal for
     amphetamine in experiment L may be an artifact.
<BR><BR>(ii). Crystallization Solvent
<BR><BR>To increase the rate of crystallization of the O-acetylnorephedrine
     hydrochloride salt and aid in removing acetic acid and any excess acetic
     anhydride that may be present, the reaction mixture was treated with
     heptane (Experiment I), methyl tert-butyl ether (Experiments F and H),
     ethanol (Experiment G), isopropanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetonitrile,
     ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, or other solvent in which the product has
     little solubility. The solid product that formed was collected by
     filtration. Heptane is a preferred solvent, as the solid produced was
     dense and did not appear to be solvated as much as with other solvents
     tried.
<BR><BR>(iii). Rate of the Acetylation Reaction
<BR><BR>The rate of the acetylation reaction is demonstrated by the results of high
     performance liquid chromatography analyses (HPLC) of a reaction at various
     time intervals (Experiment A). These results are given in Table 2 and show
     that the reaction is almost complete within 20 minutes of the reaction
     mixture becoming clear.

<BR><BR>(iv). Chemical Reactivities of Norephedrine Free Base and Salts
<BR><BR>The commercially available precursor to dextroamphetamine is
     1R,2S-(-)-norephedrine. Attempts were made to O-acetylate the norephedrine
     free base, but produced mostly N-acetylamphetamine according to an
     analysis of the carbonyl region of the infrared spectra. In one
     experiment, norephedrine free base in acetic acid was treated with 0.5
     equivalents of sulfuric acid and then treated with 1.1 equivalents of
     acetic anhydride with heating to 63.degree. C. to obtain a clear solution.
     Catalytic reduction followed by basification gave an oil that was composed
     of 13.96% amphetamine and 68% norephedrine, an indication that the
     acetylation procedure on a sulfate salt was only partially successful. In
     another experiment, a 10 mol portion of norephedrine hydrochloride was
     acetylated with a 20% excess of acetic anhydride in 2 mL acetic acid/g of
     salt and progress of the reaction followed fours (Table 2). The reaction
     mixture was diluted with 130 mL water and subjected to catalytic
     hydrogenation for 22 hours to obtain 10.4 g of oil. The long reaction time
     is attributed to the presence of acetic acid in the reduction mixture.
     Yield of amphetamine from norephedrine hydrochloride based on the weight
     of product and HPLC analysis is 66% (Experiments A and B). For these
     experiments, it can be seen that the best results were obtained with the
     salts of phenylpropylamine or norephedrine, particularly the hydrochloride
     salt.
<BR><BR>D. Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of O-Acetylnorephedrine

<BR><BR>A 500 mL 3-necked round bottom flask equipped with stirrer, addition
     funnel, condenser, and thermocontroller was charged with
     O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride (47.0 g, 0.205 mol), 131 mL of water,
     and 1.0 g of 10% palladium on carbon (50% water) catalyst. A solution of
     ammonium formate (HCOONH.sub.4 ; 15.50 g, 0.246 mol) in 20 mL water was
     then prepared. The reaction mixture in the 3-necked round bottom flask was
     then heated in a water bath temperature controlled to 71.degree. C. When
     the reaction mixture temperature reached 68.degree. C., approximately 6 mL
     of the ammonium formate solution was added in 2 mL increments to the
     reaction mixture at 5 minute intervals. When evolution of gas began to
     subside, the remainder of ammonium formate solution was added dropwise and
     the reaction mixture stirred in the water bath for approximately 1 hour.
     The water bath temperature controller was then turned off and the reaction
     mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature while stirring
     overnight. The cooled reaction mixture was then filtered to remove the
     catalyst and the filtrate was treated with 26 mL (0.50 mol) of 50% sodium
     hydroxide solution. The basified reaction mixture was then transferred to
     a separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 0.5 hour. The bottom aqueous
     layer was separated from the top oily layer and the oily layer was
     recovered (40.83 g). The oil was analyzed and the analysis had the
     following results: GLC weight-% assay: 60.18% amphetamine; Karl Fischer
     titration: 23.15% water; HPLC analysis: 79.03% amphetamine, 14.6%
     N-acetylnorephedrine, 5.49% N-acetylamphetamine, and 0.76% norephedrine;
     calculated yield: 24.6 g amphetamine (88.8%).
<BR><BR>E. Catalytic Hydrogenation of O-Acetylnorephedrine Hydrochloride
     ##STR11##
<BR><BR>A Parr bottle was charged with O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride (11.43 g)
     and 75 mL of water. The Parr bottle was flushed with nitrogen and the
     catalyst added. The bottle was then shaken on a Parr apparatus with an
     initial pressure of 55 psi. After 2 hours, the pressure drop was 4 psi (on
     tank). The Parr bottle was shaken for another hour to ensure completion of
     hydrogenolysis and then depressurized and flushed with nitrogen. The
     contents of the Parr bottle was then filtered to remove the catalyst and
     the filtrate was basified with 15 mL of 50% sodium hydroxide solution and
     the mixture was allowed to stand overnight. The mixture was then
     transferred to a separatory funnel to separate the bottom aqueous layer
     from the top oily layer; the oily layer was recovered (7.00 g). The oil
     was analyzed and the analysis had the following results: GLC weight-%
     assay: 63.02% amphetamine; HPLC analysis: 87.22% amphetamine, 10.8%
     N-acetylnorephedrine, 0.37% N-acetylamphetamine; Karl Fischer analysis:
     23.699% water; calculated yield: 4.41 g amphetamine (65.33%).
<BR><BR>F. Further Examples of the Reduction of O-Acetylnorephedrine Hydrochloride
     to Amphetamine
<BR><BR>Reduction of O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride to amphetamine is
     accomplished by either catalytic hydrogenation or catalytic transfer
     hydrogenation. Catalytic hydrogenation can be achieved in about four hours
     at room temperature in water using 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (50%
     wet with water) at 50-55 psi hydrogen pressure on a Parr shaker. Using
     this method, most of the hydrogen uptake occurs within 2 hours. Catalytic
     transfer hydrogenation using ammonium formate and 10% palladium on carbon
     (50% wet with water) in water is complete in 20-30 minutes from initiation
     of the reaction if the ammonium formate solution is added in one portion.
<BR><BR>1. Catalytic Hydrogenation
<BR><BR>Results of laboratory hydrogenation Experiments are shown in Tables 3 and
     4. In Table 4, the weight-% amphetamine was determined by GLC and the %
     composition was determined by HPLC.

    **From Experiment A
</PRE>
<BR><BR>The solubility of O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride in water is 5.5 mL/g
     (Experiment X). Hydrogenation reactions at water concentrations equal to
     or more than 5.5 mL/g appear to be about 90-95% complete in 2 hours
     (Experiment T). The presence of acetic acid seems to retard the reduction
     (Experiment B). Ethanol reduces the solubility of the salt and thus may
     require a larger volume of solvent for hydrogenation to proceed readily
     (Experiment BB). If either acetic acid or ethanol is used, an extra step
     in the work-up to remove the organic solvent is necessary. This makes
     water an excellent solvent for the catalytic reduction as the volume is
     not excessive, it is not flammable, and it is inexpensive. Rigorous
     purging of the hydrogenation vessel with an inert gas before charging the
     palladium catalyst is not required with water, as it would be with a
     flammable solvent. The amphetamine obtained from Experiments T, V, and Y
     was separated from the aqueous solution after basification rather than
     extracting with a solvent. The crude amphetamine was shown by Karl Fischer
     water analysis to contain 23-24% water. This accounts for yields greater
     than 100% and lower weight-% amphetamine values.
<BR><BR>2. Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation
<BR><BR>For catalytic transfer hydrogenation, a mixture of O-acetylnorephedrine
     hydrochloride, water, and 10% palladium on carbon (50% wet with water) can
     be treated with 1.2 equivalents of ammonium formate and heated until an
     exothermic reaction accompanied by evolution of gas occurs. The reaction
     is completed when the evolution of gas subsides. Results of Experiments
     using catalytic transfer hydrogenation are shown in Table 5. These
     reactions were done at temperatures between 60.degree. C.-80.degree. C.
     except for the higher temperature attained in the exotherm.

<BR><BR>When a large excess of ammonium formate is used, a white solid sublimes
     into the condenser. Sublimation was not observed with only a 10-20% excess
     of ammonium formate. A 10-20% excess of ammonium formate appears to be
     sufficient for complete reaction. The exotherm and evolution of gas were
     also seen at about 52.degree. C. in Experiment DD that was conducted in
     methanol.
<BR><BR>3. Comparison of Hydrogenolysis Reactions
<BR><BR>In both types of the hydrogenolysis reactions, workup, with one exception,
     consists of filtering the reaction mixture to remove the palladium on
     carbon catalyst, basifying the filtrate to pH 14, separation of the
     aqueous layer from the amphetamine layer, and distillation of the
     amphetamine. That exception was Experiment DD where the filtered reaction
     mixture was concentrated and the residue taken up in water and basified.
     The two types of hydrogenolysis reactions are comparable in efficiency,
     with the catalytic transfer hydrogenation being the faster. However, there
     is a question of safety as there is an induction period with the catalytic
     transfer hydrogenation reaction accompanied by considerable evolution of
     gas when the reaction begins. The reaction can be partially controlled by
     initial addition of only about 25% of the ammonium formate as an aqueous
     solution and heating the mixture until the reaction begins. The remainder
     of the ammonium formate solution can then be added at a suitable rate.
<BR><BR>Ammonium formate appears to catalyze the rearrangement of
     O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride to N-acetylnorephedrine. Three samples
     of O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride (Experiment Z recrystallized) were
     stirred with water for six hours respectively at room temperature, at
     60.degree. C., and at 60.degree. C. with ammonium formate added. Samples
     were taken at intervals for HPLC analyses. At room temperature, the
     percentage of O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride decreased from 99.30 to
     99.12% over a period of 6 hours and the percentage of N-acetylnorephedrine
     increased from 0.10% to 0.21%. At 60.degree. C., the percentage of
     O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride decreased from 99.18 to 97.79 with the
     percentage of N-acetylnorephedrine increasing from 0.21% to 1.1% over a 6
     hour period. With the ammonium formate mixture at 60.degree. C., the
     percentage of O-acetylnorephedrine hydrochloride dropped to 91.23% within
     30 minutes and to 77.20% by 6 hours while the amount of
     N-acetylnorephedrine increased from 7.51% to 20.95%. The catalytic
     hydrogenation route therefore appears to be preferable to catalytic
     transfer hydrogenation in view of the induction period, gas evolution, and
     rearrangement potential.
<BR><BR>The amphetamine obtained from several of the hydrogenolysis reactions of
     both types was analyzed by HPLC and/or GLC and the results summarized in
     Table 7. The products of Experiments Experiment P and Experiment Q were
     obtained by extraction into ether and drying of the extract to remove any
     water. The product obtained in Experiments R, S, and U were shown by Karl
     Fischer analyses to contain water and is compensated for in the Weight-%
     amphetamine analyses. The percent yield of amphetamine is calculated from
     the actual weight of the product isolated and the percentage of
     amphetamine in the product as determined by GLC or HPLC weight-% analyses.
     The composition of the product is the area-% analysis.
