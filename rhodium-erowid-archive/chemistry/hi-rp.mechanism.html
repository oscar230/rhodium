<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The synthesis of <em>ortho</em>-substituted benzoic acid <strong>3</strong> from benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> in the presence of hydriodic
acid-red phosphorus (HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>) occurs via the formation of benzylphthalide <strong>2</strong> as reaction intermediate. lts
preparation is optimized by use of the supported reaction in &quot;dry media&quot; process (Silica/HI<sub>aq</sub>) under microwave
irradiation for 8 min. The role of the red phosphorus in the reduction reaction is elucidated: it intervenes
in a catalytic cycle by an oxido-reductive disproportionation with the liberated iodine, affording either
hypophosphorous acid in aqueous media, or P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> in anhydrous media with concomitant regeneration of HI.
Thus, the presence of Pred in the couple 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' allows recycling of the hydriodic acid and enhances its
reducing efficiency.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Since the couple hydriodic acid/red phosphorus (HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>) was introduced as a reducing reagent into organic
chemistry a long time ago, the synthetic aspects of its use (hydrogenation, deoxygenation of alcohols,
ketones, ketoacids and quinones, cleavage of phenol ethers, and reductive cleavage of lactones) have been
extensively studied<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, the mechanistic aspects have not been thoroughly investigated, and
consequently the role of the red phosphorus remains ambiguous despite its proved efficiency and its
usefulness.</p>

<p>Previous work in our laboratory has focused on the study of the reactivity of the amorphous red
phosphorus<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. We have demonstrated that its basic hydrolysis allows the generation of the phosphine PH<sub>3</sub>, the
hydrogen and the hypophosphite ion. Furthermore, since 1962, it was established that in acid-catalysed
disproportionation, white phosphorus is converted into phosphine and phosphoric acid at high temperature<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.
White phosphorus, phosphine, and hypophosphorous acid are well known for their reducing properties, and the
question of the role of red phosphorus in acidic media and particularly in the couple 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' arises.
Pursuing our investigation into the reactivity and the reducing character of red phosphorus, we wish to report
here the synthesis of the 2-(2-phenyl-ethyl)-benzoic acid <strong>3</strong>, precursor of neurotropic derivatives, by
reductive cleavage of benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> in the presence of hydriodic acid-red phosphorus (HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>), and
the role of red phosphorus upon the reducing properties of this reagent.</p>

<p>The synthesis of ortho-substituted benzoic acid <strong>3</strong> in the presence of hydriodic acid-red phosphorus
(HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>) requires long reaction times (15 h) under heating at 120�C (Scheme <strong>1</strong>)<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. In an attempt to improve
the reaction conditions, we have realized various experiments at 120�C for the reaction times ranging between
1 h to 15 h (Fig. <strong>1</strong>).</p>

<p>We observe the disappearance of benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> after 1 h and the quasi-quantitative formation of a new
compound which disappears as a function of time in favour of <strong>3</strong> (Table <strong>1</strong>).</p>

<p>We have isolated this reaction intermediate <strong>2</strong> and its spectroscopic data are in agreement with the
structure of the 3-benzylphthalide. The methods described for the preparation of <strong>2</strong> involve either an
electrolytic reduction<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> or a catalytic hydrogenation<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> over Pd/C or in the presence of Raney nickel with long
reaction times and low to moderate yields. We have carried out the reduction of <strong>1</strong> on silica in the absence of
solvent ('dry media' process<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>) and in the absence of red phosphorus. </p>

<p>A solution of HI<sub>aq</sub> and benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> is impregnated on silica and heated at 120�C for 1 h. The
extraction of solid support by toluene allows one to obtain benzylphthalide <strong>2</strong> in 95% yield. When a microwave
oven<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> is used instead of the oil bath, the reaction time is reduced to 8 min (Table <strong>1</strong>, exp. no. <strong>9</strong>). Thus,
this easy and selective hydrogenation of the C=C double bond by impregnated HI<sub>aq</sub> on silica constitutes a
highly useful synthesis procedure, since it allows one to avoid the use of low-valent transition metal ions
(Cr, Ti)<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>, or triethylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>. Furthermore, it must be noted that, in our
conditions, we have never observed any hydroiodination reaction<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Since it is well known that ultrasound is more effective in the case of heterogeneous solid-liquid
reactions<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a>, we then attempted the reduction of benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> in the presence of 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' under
sonication at 20 kHz. When the sonication was carried out at 30�C or 80�C, no reaction occurs. However, the
reaction did take place at 120�C under sonication, but without any improvement with respect to standard
procedure. This is probably due to the high reaction temperature which decreases the ultrasound effects.</p>

<p>Consequently, the synthesis of <strong>3</strong> was carried out in two steps: (<strong>i</strong>) the fast hydrogenation of benzylidene
moiety without ring-opening of the &gamma;-lactone, followed by (<strong>ii</strong>) the slow hydrolysis to the benzylic cation
followed by reduction. We have demonstrated that the achievement of the reaction, whether from benzalphthalide
<strong>1</strong> or benzylphthalide <strong>2</strong>, requires 15 h under classical heating at 120�C to afford <strong>3</strong> in 65% yield.</p>

<p>In an attempt to clarify the role of the red phosphorus in acidic media, a series of reactions were
undertaken in the presence and in the absence of red phosphorus for 1, 4, and 15 h at 120�C (Table <strong>1</strong>, exp.
nos. <strong>1-6</strong>). Whereas the reaction of <strong>1</strong> with 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' affords <strong>3</strong> in increasing yields as a function of time,
the same reaction without red phosphorus is stopped at the stage of formation of <strong>2</strong>. The <sup>31</sup>P-NMR analysis of
the reaction mixture in the presence of 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' does not exhibit the formation of organophosphorus
compounds but the presence of phosphorus acids (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). Consequently, we have assumed the
presence of a catalytic cycle in which the red intervenes in an oxido-reductive disproportionation with the
liberated iodine.</p>

<p>Actually, hydriodic acid dissociates by a reversible reaction at high temperature (120�C) to iodine and
hydrogen which is the reducing reagent. In the literature, the direct generation of PH<sub>3</sub> from white phosphorus
can be realized either in acidic media at 280�C<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> or by an electrolytic method<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>. In our conditions, the red
phosphorus cannot give the phosphine PH<sub>3</sub> directly [ <em>E�</em>(I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>-</sup>) = +0.53 V and <em>E�</em>(P<sub>red</sub>/PH<sub>3</sub>) = -0.111 V ]<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>.
However, from the moment that the iodine is liberated, it reacts with the red phosphorus and affords the
hypophosphorous acid and HI [ <em>E�</em>(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>) = -0.365V ]<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>, allowing the equilibrium to shift in favour of the
generation of hydrogen by removal of iodine and also by generation of hydriodic acid (Scheme <strong>2</strong>). The
regenerated HI functioning by a dissociative mechanism again affords hydrogen and iodine which can be consumed
by red and also by hypophosphorous acid to give phosphorous acid and HI [ <em>E�</em>(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>) = -0.499V ]<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>. Thus,
the catalytic cycle can continue until the formation of phosphoric acid [ <em>E�</em>(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>) = -0.276V ]<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>.
Furthermore, this latter can be reduced by P<sub>red</sub> to again give the hydriodic acid [ <em>E�</em>(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>) = -0.383
V ]<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> via the formation of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>, etc.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/hirp-sch2-3.gif" width="397" height="544" border="0">
</div>

<p>In anhydrous media, the oxidation of red phosphorus by iodine allows the equilibrium to shift in favour of
the generation of hydrogen by removal of iodine as P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub>. This latter decomposes in the presence of water to
phosphoric acid and phosphonium iodide which affords, under heating, the hydriodic acid and the phosphine
PH<sub>3</sub><a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>. Oxidation of PH<sub>3</sub> by the liberated iodine in the presence of water gives H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> , and the catalytic
cycle can thus be continued (Scheme <strong>3</strong>). Actually, the reduction of 2-pyrrolecarboxylic acid to the
corresponding 3,4-dehydroproline in the presence of phosphonium iodide in fuming HI or aqueous solution of
hypophosphorous acid saturated with gaseous HI has been realized<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>

<p>When an excess of hydriodic acid is added to the reaction mixture, we observe no improvement upon the
formation of <strong>3 </strong>(less than 5%) (Table <strong>1</strong>, exp. no. <strong>7</strong>).</p>

<p>In contrast, when the excess of HI is progressively added, <strong>3</strong> is obtained in 60% yield for 4h (Table <strong>1</strong>, exp.
no. <strong>8</strong>). The role of P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> as reaction intermediate is demonstrated by the experiment nos. <strong>10-13</strong> (Table <strong>1</strong>).
Whereas the reaction of <strong>1</strong> and P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> in anhydrous toluene at 120�C for 1 h affords neither <strong>2</strong> nor <strong>3</strong>, the same
reaction in the presence of water (five equivalents) gives quantitatively <strong>2</strong> and the various phosphorus acids.
The P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> can be generated in situ from red phosphorus and iodine<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> in anhydrous toluene, and when the
reaction occurs in the presence of P<sub>red</sub> and iodine in acetic acid and water (five equivalents) at 120�C for
4 h, <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> are obtained in 80% and 15% yield respectively.</p>

<p>In conclusion, HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub> can be replaced by red phosphorus, iodine and water. The red phosphorus intervenes
in the reducing properties of HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub> by its reducing character to consume the liberated iodine and
affording either hypophosphorous acid in aqueous media, or P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> in anhydrous media with concomitant
regeneration of HI. Thus, the driving force of the reaction is presumably the oxidation of the red phosphorus
by iodine and the presence of P<sub>red</sub> in the couple 'HI<sub>aq</sub>/P<sub>red</sub>' allows recycling of the hydriodic acid and
enhances its reducing efficiency.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>Benzalphthalide was prepared by condensation of benzylic acid and phthalic anhydride at 230�C according to
the procedure already described<a href="hi-rp.mechanism.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>. Red phosphorus (<em>Prolabo</em>), silica (60-<em>Merck</em>), hydriodic acid (aqueous 57%
solution) and iodine (<em>Aldrich</em>) were used as received.</p>

<h4>General procedure</h4>

<h4>3.1 Conventional heating</h4>

<p>Benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> (0.2 g; 0.9 mmol) and amorphous red phosphorus (0.12 g; 3.87 mmol) were placed in the
reactor fitted with a reflux condenser. A solution of aqueous 57% hydriodic acid (1 ml; 7.65 mmol) was added
dropwise to the mixture then heated in an oil bath equipped with a thermostat at 120�C for 1, 4 or 15 h.</p>

<p>The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, a solution of toluene/ethanol (80:20) was added and the
unreacted red phosphorus was filtered off. The <sup>31</sup>P-NMR analysis of the reaction mixture exhibited the
presence of hypophosphorous acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>), phosphorous acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>), and phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>).</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> The solution was basified by an aqueous 10% solution of potassium hydroxide and extracted by toluene.
The organic phase was washed with an aqueous 10% sodium hydrosulphite (NaHSO<sub>3</sub>) then with distilled water. The organic
phase was dried over magnesium sulphate then evaporated to dryness. The recrystallization in hexane afforded
the 3-benzylphthalide <strong>2</strong> as a beige solid: mp 60-61�C.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The aqueous phase was acidified by an aqueous 35% hydrochloric acid and again extracted with toluene.
The organic phase was washed with an aqueous 10% sodium hydrosulphite (NaHSO<sub>3</sub>) then with distilled water. The organic
phase was dried over magnesium sulphate then evaporated to dryness. The recrystallization in ethanol afforded
the 2-(2-phenyl-ethyl)-benzoic acid <strong>3</strong> as a white solid: mp 130�C.</p>

<h4>3.2. Microwave irradiation</h4>

<p>A mixture of aqueous 57% hydriodic acid (1 ml; 7.65 mmol) and benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> (0.2g; 0.9 mmol) in
dichloromethane was added to silica (1 g). The dichloromethane was then evaporated until a wet powder was
obtained. This powder was then placed in a Teflon reaction vessel and irradiated in a microwave oven (Brandt
ME 210 (850 W), power setting = 6) at 2450 MHz for 8 min. After cooling, the solid was extracted with a
solution of toluene/ethanol (80:20), and after filtration, the mixture was treated and purified as above.</p>

<h4>3.3. Ultrasound irradiation</h4>

<p>Apparatus: ultrasound generator, Bioblock Vibracell 600W (20 kHz) connected to a cup horn (diam. 60 mm,
power setting = 5) with a flat-bottomed flask dipped in contact with the horn. The same amounts of reagents as
conventional heating were used. The reaction temperature was adjusted at 30�C, 80�C, and 120�C by means of a
thermostat. The work-up was the same as that in the conventional method.</p>

<h4>3.4. Reduction in the presence of P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub></h4>

<p>Distilled water (0.04 ml; 2.2 mmol) was added to a mixture of benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> (0.1 g; 0.45 mmol) and P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub>
(0.25 g; 0.44 mmol) in toluene (2 ml). The mixture was heated at 120�C for 4 h, then treated as before.</p>

<h4>3.5. Reduction in the presence of Pred/I2/H2O</h4>

<p>To a mixture of benzalphthalide <strong>1</strong> (0.2 g; 0.9 mmol), red phosphorus (0.12g; 3.87 mmol), iodine (0.57g; 2.24
mmol) in glacial acetic acid (3 ml) was added 0.07 ml of distilled water (3.88 mmol). The mixture was then
heated at 120�C for 4h. The work-up was the same as that above.</p>
