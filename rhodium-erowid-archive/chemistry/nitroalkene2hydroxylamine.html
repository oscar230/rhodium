  <p>In connection with our ongoing program directed toward the synthesis of radiolabeled 
    amphetamine derivatives<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, we required a convenient 
    method for the preparation of hydroxylamines, A survey of the literature indicated 
    that the most convenient syntheses of N-substituted hydroxylamines involved 
    the reduction of conjugated nitroalkenes<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a>. 
    Other methods include the reduction of oximes<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 
    and nitro salts<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> or the oxidation of amines<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. 
    The latter methods are involved and are not readily amenable to the synthesis 
    of the desired target molecules.</p>

<p>Since catalytic hydrogenation of conjugated nitroalkenes is reported to be 
  a complex reaction<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, we investigated the reduction 
  of conjugated nitroalkenes utilizing lithium aluminum hydride<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
  Unfortunately, in our hands, mixtures were obtained under a variety of conditions. 
  We then investigated the reduction of conjugated nitroalkenes with boron hydrides. 
  It had been reported that the sodium borohyride reduction of a,�-unsaturated 
  nitroalkenes produces the corresponding nitroalkanes (<strong>Eq 1</strong>)<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, 
  In a later study, Feuer reported<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> that nitro 
  salts (nitronates) are readily reduced to hydroxylamines by borane complexes, 
  <strong>Eq 2</strong> (i.e, the nitro compounds are unreactive). These reactions 
  presumably occur through a common intermediate 1, which can then be hydrolyzed 
  directly to nitroalkane or reduced with a borane complex to yield hydroxylamine 
  after hydrolysis, It occurred to us that these reactions could be utilized to 
  prepare the desired hydroxylamine directly from the conjugated nitroalkenes.</p>

<p>We have found that sodium borohydride catalyzes the reaction of borane complexes 
  with a,�-unsaturated nitro compounds, The reaction is straightforward. A catalytic 
  amount of sodium borohydride is added to a normally unreactive mixture of the 
  a,�-unsaturated nitro compound and the borane complex at room temperature. The 
  pure hydroxylamines are readily isolated in high yields (<strong>Eq 3</strong>). 
  Our results are summarized in <strong>Table I</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Synthesis of N-Substituted Hydroxylamines </h3>

	<p><strong>General Procedure.</strong> 
	<br>
      The synthesis of <strong>N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanamine</strong> is representative 
      of the procedure employed.</p> 

    <p>A flame-dried, nitrogen-flushed, 250-mL flask, equipped with a septum inlet, 
      magnetic stirring bar, and reflux condenser was cooled to 0�C. A BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF 
      solution (10 mmol, 4.0 mL of a 2.5 M) was injected into the reaction flask 
      via a syringe, followed by the slow addition of a solution of �-nitrostyrene 
      in THF (10 mmol, 1.5 g in 20 mL of THF). After the addition, the ice bath 
      was removed and a catalytic amount (~30 mg) of NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added 
      to the stirred reaction mixture by means of a spatula. A moderately exothermic 
      reaction ensued. The reaction was allowed to proceed until the yellow color 
      of the starting material disappeared (1 h). Ice-water (100 mL) was added 
      to reaction mixture that was then acidified with 10% HCl (~20 mL). The mixture 
      was stirred, heated at 60-65�C for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature. 
      The acidic layer was washed with ether (3x50 mL) and then the hydroxylamine 
      liberated via the addition of sodium hydroxide (aqueous). Solid NaCl was 
      added and the product extracted into ether. The combined ethereal extracts 
      were dried over anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub> and the solvent removed under 
      reduced pressure to yield 1.1 g (80%) of N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanamine: mp 
      85-86�C (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> 83-84�C,<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>6b</sup></a> 
      84-85�C); melting point of the oxalate salt 171-173�C (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>6b</sup></a> 
      170-175�C dec).</p>

      (2 mmol, 0.8 mL of a 2,5 M solution) were mixed, and a catalytic amount 
      of NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added as described in the general procedure to yield 
      (30 min) 0.216 g (85%) of N-cyclohexylhydroxylamine: mp 137-138 �C (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>4b</sup></a> 
      138-139�C); melting point of the hydrochloride 137-142�C dec (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> 
      142�C).</p> 
	
	<h4>N-Hydroxyamphetamine </h4>
	
	<p>�-Methyl-�-nitrostyrene (4 mmol, 0.652 g) dissolved in 14 mL of THF and 
      BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (4 mmol, 1.6 mL of a 2.5 M solution) were mixed, 
      and a catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added to yield (2 h) 0.447 
      g (74%) of N-hydroxyamphetamine: mp 61-62�C (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>6b</sup></a> 
      60.5-62�C); melting point of the oxalate salt 172-173�C (lit.<a href="nitroalkene2hydroxylamine.html#refs"><sup>6b</sup></a> 
      167-169�C. </p>
	
	<h4>N-Hydroxy-p-bromoamphetamine</h4> 
	
	<p>p-Bromo-�-methyl-�-nitrostyrene (3 
    mmol, 0.726 g in 10 mL of THF) and BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (3 mmol, 1.2 mL of a 2.5 M solution) 
    were mixed, and a catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added to yield (1 h) 0.540 
    g (78%) of N-hydroxy-p-bromoamphetamine: mp 60-61�C; melting point of the 
    oxalate 169-174�C dec. </p>
	
	<h4>N-Hydroxy-p-nitroamphetamine </h4>
	
	<p>A mixture of p-nitro-�-nitro-�-methylstyrene (5 mmol, 1.04 g) in 25 mL 
      of THF and BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (5 mmol, 2.0 mL of a 2.5 M solution) 
      was treated with catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> to yield (1.5 h) 0.750 g (77%) 
      of N-hydroxy-p-nitroamphetamine: mp 71-72�C; melting point of the oxalate 
      185-186�C. </p>
	
	<h4>N-Hydroxy-p-(diethylamino)amphetamine </h4>
	
	<p>A mixture of p-(diethylamino)-�-methyl-�-nitrostyrene (1 mmol, 0.234 g) 
      in 6 mL of THF and BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (1 mmol, 0.4 mL of a 2.5 M 
      solution) was treated with a catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> to yield 
      (3 h) 0.19g (85%) of N-hydroxy-p-(diethylamino)amphetamine: melting point 
      of the oxalate 125-126�C. </p>
    
	<h4>N-Hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxyamphetamine </h4>
	
    <p> A mixture of 2,3-dimethoxy-�-nitrostyrene (8 mmol, 1,784 g) in 25 mL of 
      THF and BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (8 mmol, 3.2 mL of a 2.5 M solution) was 
      treated with a catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> to yield (1 h) 1.182 
      g (70%) of N-hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxyamphetamine: mp 66-67�C; oxalate mp 132-133�C. 
    </p>
	
	<h4>N-Hydroxyanthracene-9-ethanamine </h4>
	
	<p>A mixture of 9-(&omega;-nitrovinyl)anthracene (10 mmol, 2.5 g) in 20 mL of 
      THF and BH<sub>3</sub>&middot;THF (10 mmol, 4.0 mL of a 2.5 M solution) 
      was treated with a catalytic amount of NaBH<sub>4</sub> (1 h). When an ether extraction 
      of the acidic aqueous layer was attempted, a pale yellow precipitate appeared 
      that was filtered, washed with H2O and dried to yield 1.532 g (56%) of the 
      hydrochloride of N-hydroxyanthracene-9-ethanamine: mp 178-184�C dec. The 
      aqueous filtrate was neutralized with aqueous NaOH and a precipitate was 
      obtained which was filtered, washed with H<sub>2</sub>O, and dried to yield an additional 
      0.43 g (18%) of N-hydroxyanthracene-9-ethanamine: mp 126-128�C dec.</p>
