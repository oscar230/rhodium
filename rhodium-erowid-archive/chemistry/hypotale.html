<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Due to the difficulty in some area’s 
  to acquire rp, SWIM went in search of alternate methods for Go-Go.&nbsp; (Well, 
  and to try something new).&nbsp; A post on Rhodium’s site done by Pebble (<a href="hypophosphorus.html">Reduction of Ephedrine 
  to Methamphetamine Using Hypophosphorus Acid</a>) with a few references on the 
  hive where all that was found.&nbsp; After several very successful reaction 
  and amazed at the quality of end product it was determined that more info was 
  needed out there.&nbsp; Pebbles method had many concerns regarding safety that 
  were bothersome.&nbsp; (Smelling contents in between stages of the reaction.&nbsp; 
  Reaction being carried out in an open vessel, ect…). That brings us to this 
  point.</font></p>

  <v:path o:extrusionok="f" gradientshapeok="t" o:connecttype="rect"/> </v:shapetype>The 
  E and Hypo are placed into the reaction flask (250ml flat bottom or larger).&nbsp; 
  Heat is genteelly applied to the flask.&nbsp; What your are looking for is the 
  E mixing with the Hypo.&nbsp; Not all the E will mix, but get as much as possible.&nbsp; 
  Place <b><u>sealed</u></b>&nbsp; flask in the freezer for 20- 30 min.&nbsp; 
  <b>(Hypo loves to absorb moisture)</b> Set up the reflux condenser with ice 
  water circulating through it. If no reflux is available connect tubing to a 
  stopper of the appropriate size to fit the reaction flask. (Any which way, drink 
  a beer).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Remove the flask and place in a ice bath, 
  acetone and ice works well fine. On rxn above 10g one may concider using Dry 
  Ice and acetone for a ice bath.. (Keeping the contents cold will help buy you 
  some time while connecting up the reflux condenser or tubing and will help keep 
  the reaction under control). Attach tubing to the end of the reflux condenser, 
  or flask if not using a condenser, and run it to your vapor containment unit 
  (VCU, p/p unit, a bottle with the tube stuck inside and a wet paper towel to 
  seal off the opening.&nbsp; The beer bottle from that beer you just drank could 
  work). <b>The I is added to the flask and spread over hypo/E as best as possible 
  while the contents are still frozen</b>.&nbsp; Once the I hits the Hypo/E mix 
  and the flask and contents slowly warm, it will start to liquefy. (Sometimes 
  one side of the flask is still frozen while the other is bubbling away). Bubbling 
  will start to occur and will get more vigorous.&nbsp; Better yields and fewer 
  side products are obtainable by allowing the reaction to liquefy, but not bubble 
  out of control at first. (<b>DO NOT</b> <b>smell the fumes…They will raise hell 
  with your nose and lungs</b>).&nbsp; The flask may have white smoke inside.  
  Once liquefied, gently swirl the flask and mix the contents as best as possible.&nbsp; 
  The color should go from dark red/purple to a light reddish-yellow.&nbsp; If 
  the color didn’t change or the I2 is still liquid, gently swirling the reaction 
  flask and place onto a <b>WARM</b> heat source. (Try using the palm of your 
  hand first then a hot plate set on warm).&nbsp; If the contents of the flask 
  have not gone to a orange-ish/reddish color after applying heat, then add 1 
  - 2ml of Hypo and mix gently.&nbsp; If your Hypo has been <a href="hypotale.html#conc">concentrated</a>, 
  the reaction should have started without the addition of any heat.&nbsp; If 
  the hypo was not concentrated heat will have to be applied to boil off the excess 
  water.</font></p>
<img src="pictures/setup-1.jpg" width="224" height="302" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Apply 
low-heat to the reaction flask until it starts to bubbling at a good hard steady 
rate.&nbsp; <b>Note:  DO NOT heat contents above 180°<font size="2"> -<font size="3"> 
200</font></font><font size="3">° C or yields can suffer</font>.  </b>Once a steady 
bubbling begins, look for white crystals (HI) in the tubing or in the glass tubing 
connector in the stopper.  If a fog is forming in the vessel, try to keep it going 
for a few minuets.  The contents should continue to bubble by itself for some 
time even when removed from the heat.&nbsp; (30 sec up to 4 min, depending on 
the vessels wall thickness and the Hypo/I amount).  Look at the color of the reaction.  
If you notice a reddish color starting to appear, give the contents a few swirls 
and then place back on the heat.  If the reddish color forms again, 1-2 ml Hypo 
should be added down the condenser/tubing and placed back on the heat.  The color 
should lighten back up to a light gold/pale yellow color.&nbsp; Remove from heat.</font> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After the boiling has subsided, mix/swirl 
  the contents and then heat was again applied to the bottom of the flask.&nbsp; 
  <i>Notice the length in time decreases that it will boil by itself.&nbsp; Pay 
  attention to the size of the bubbles in the solution while the contents are 
  being heated.&nbsp; As the reaction goes on the size of the bubbles get larger</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <b>Note:&nbsp; Keep the contents liquefied.&nbsp; To much mixing and letting 
  the contents cool will cause it to solidify and is a pain to get it going again.</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><img src="pictures/hi-smoke.jpg" width="266" height="211" align="right">White 
  smoke should have been noticed faintly flowing into the flask.  Large amounts 
  of 'snow' should be pressent on the glass walls. Add a few mls of dH2O down 
  the tubing or reflux condencer to wash the 'snow' down. Return to the heat source. 
  After 20 - 30 min of the smoke flowing into the reaction vessel, disconnect 
  the tubing at the opposite end of the flask and add a few more ml (1 to 2 ml 
  MAX) of dH2O to assist in washing down the new 'snow'. Work the water down into 
  the flask.&nbsp; You should start seeing more white smoke flowing into the vessel.&nbsp;Apply 
  heat until the fog flow rate into the flask is clearly obvious and fairly constant.  
  ( Usually let this run for another 10-15 min…Overkill? Don’t know, but one wants 
  to make sure everything has been converted) <b>Note:  Check the temp of the 
  reaction.  Remember to not go above 180°<font size="2"> C<font size="3"> or 
  yields can suffer. </font></font></b>When the size of the bubbles is dramaticly 
  larger than they originally where, the reaction is done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If unsure the reaction went, apply heat 
  once again and notice if there is a change in bubble size and length of time 
  it bubbles when removed.  The color of the solution should now be a pale yellow 
  to almost a clear color.  If the bubbling dies off fairly quickly, its probably 
  done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Un-stopper the flask.  Now all the harsh 
  nasty vapors should be undetectable.&nbsp; If experience has been done with 
  the rp/I method you should be able to smell “That Smell”, if not experienced, 
  there should be a sweat rotten-egg smell, but nothing that irritates your nose.  
  If “The Smell” is  undetectable, your not done.  Place contents back onto the 
  heat source and bring to a slow boil for 10 - 15 minutes (almost like refluxing), 
  and then check again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Phase One completed.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a name="_Toc1036115"><font size="5">A 
  light at the end of the tunnel</font></a></font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Continue washing&nbsp; down the walls 
  of the flask, condenser/tubing with dH2O.&nbsp; Once satisfied, prepare 200 
  to 400 ml of your NP (Toluene, Naphtha, Xylene ect.) and place post-reaction 
  vessel in a ice bath.&nbsp; (Whooooaaaa there little horsy!!!&nbsp; <v:shape id="_x0000_i1025" type="#_x0000_t75">

  </v:shape> You didn’t filter it…No need to since you are not using rp.&nbsp; 
  Put in <b>CLEAN </b>precursors, you get clean post reaction solution.  A perk 
  of this method over the rp’s, you get the goods without the crud).&nbsp; While 
  contents are chilling, now is a great time for another beer and to clean up 
  the equipment from phase one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> With the NP and near Go-Go cooled, add 
  your sodium hydroxide (aqueous solution or direct) in small amounts to the flask.&nbsp; 
  <b>NOTE:  A solution is preferred over directly adding lye to contents due to 
  less gaak noticed in the pull process and less exothermic reaction.  </b>What 
  one should be looking for is ’snow’ or the solution turning white to form and 
  not clear up after several minutesLet the contents settle down again and mix/swirl 
  flask.  If the white went away, your not there, so add a bit more base.  This 
  process will keep one from adding more lye than needed and causing ‘Lye Lock’ 
  from occurring.&nbsp; Keep adding your lye in small portions and swirling until 
  the solution is ph 12.5+.&nbsp; If desired, pour in some salt to help push all 
  the Go-Go up into the NP, but use NON-IONIZED!.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><img src="pictures/sep.jpg" width="76" height="209" align="left">Decant 
  the top layer into your sep funnel.&nbsp; Don’t worry if some of the bottom 
  layer gets in, you want to get all of your NP though.&nbsp; Shake, swirl what 
  ever for several minutes. Let settle then decant the bottom layer off and SAVE.  
  Swirl the funnel to wash the side wall down.&nbsp; While the contents settle, 
  drink a beer while you heat up 50 ml of dH2O in the microwave (for about 45 
  sec, or until it boils vigoursly).&nbsp; Drain off the bottom layer again if 
  any.&nbsp; Pour in the hot dH2O into the sep.&nbsp; Swirl the sep around for 
  a few seconds before placing the top on <b>LOOSELY</b>.&nbsp; (Vapors are produced 
  when something is heated).&nbsp; Wash the NP layer well to rid it of any Gaak, 
  contaminants and excess sodium ions. While contents are settling, finish the 
  remainder of the open beer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Decant the bottom layer and add 50 - 
  100 ml of chilled dH2O. (About 1/2 the amount of NP).&nbsp; Swirl/mix/shake 
  the contents.&nbsp; Let settle and then decant.&nbsp; Do this a few more times 
  with hot then cold dH2O.&nbsp;After the final wash, let the sep settle for awhile.&nbsp; 
  Drain off the bottom layer of water/Gaak if any.&nbsp; Swirl funnel to wash 
  down the sidewalls and let settle.&nbsp; Drain again if needed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Add 30 – 40 ml of dH2O to the sep.&nbsp; 
  Now add 4 – 6 drops of HCI.&nbsp; (Its actually about 6 drops/gram of expected 
  Go-Go, but until you have the process down add the HCl in smaller portions to 
  avoid possible problems until you are familiar with the process of A/B).&nbsp; 
  Mix thoroughly by shaking or swirling vigoursly.&nbsp; Let settle and check 
  the pH of the bottom layer.&nbsp; If using pool/spa test strips, note the <i>Total 
  Alkalinity</i>.&nbsp; As this number gets closer to the <i>OK</i> range, it 
  will take less and less HCI to lower the pH.&nbsp; (Some may say that is all 
  that needs to be done is drop the pH down the first time and follow up with 
  <a href="hypotale.html#Another">Acetone Crashing</a>.&nbsp; It doesn’t 
  make much difference, just preference).&nbsp; Add more HCI, mix, and check again.&nbsp; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If slowly adjusting the pH bit by bit, 
  once the pH is 7.0 to 7.3, place this liquid in the PYREX pan and the pan on 
  the hot plate turned on low, to be dried.&nbsp; If Acetone Crashing was done, 
  pour off excess acetone (and save) then rinse all the Go-Go again with chilled 
  Acetone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No matter what process was done in the 
  above step, there is still one more step to be carried out for quality, purity 
  and prideful reasons, known as Recrystallization<i>.&nbsp; (<b>Hell, if no attention 
  was paid to the <font color="red"><a href="hypotale.html#disclamier">disclaimer/warning</a></font>

  </font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(<i>from Worlocks website: rxn1)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Re-crystallization of chili using methanol,&nbsp; 
  denatured alcohol, or&nbsp; 91% isopropyl alc. will grow some very pretty, large 
  crystals and will make your product more pure and much more potent. This is 
  one procedure that is simplicity itself and always produces a major improvement&nbsp; 
  with surprisingly little loss of product. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br>

  C<b><i>rystals, using denatured alc. and&nbsp; vision ware (Worlock)</i></b>&nbsp; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After the chili was pulled out of the 
  toluene (non-polar solution) using&nbsp; HCl and water,&nbsp; It was run through 
  a filter and placed in a vision ware bowl for evaporation. The water was evaporated&nbsp; 
  leaving the crude raw Crystals. <br>
  These were crushed and washed with ice cold dry acetone. <br>
  The washed Crystals were then dissolved in hot denatured alc. the alcohol was 
  boiled away until the first sign of skin forming or the first sign of crystallization 
  noted. Remove from the heat add enough alcohol to remove the skinning so no 
  more crystallization can be seen then add 20 ml of acetone, if it turns cloudy 
  add alcohol drop wise until it is clear again&nbsp; cover and place in freezer 
  6 hours or more( overnight is great) you will return to find crystals floating 
  in the liquor. <br>
  Rapidly filter out the cold crystals , then wash them with a little cold alcohol 
  to remove any gaak on the surface and in the outer crystal layer, set out to 
  dry.. <br>
  All three steps were performed without ever removing the chili from the vision 
  ware bowl. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br>
  <b><u><font size="4">Recrystallization details</font></u></b> <br>
  The Chili is dissolved in a minimum&nbsp; amount of dry alcohol,&nbsp; this 
  is&nbsp; heated,&nbsp; <b><u><font size="4" color="red">USING a Safety fan (Always)</font></u></b> 
  <br>
  as needed&nbsp; to get it to dissolve , bring it to a soft boil . Continue boiling 
  until you begin to&nbsp; see the chili form crystals on the surface of the alcohol.&nbsp; 
  Known as the <b><i><u>Lynrd sign</u></i>.</b>, <br>
  <i>(The Lynrd sign??&nbsp; Skynrd??&nbsp; The chili forms a surface skin &lt;yuk-yuk&gt;&nbsp; 
  it was a joke get it ??&nbsp; Lynrd Skynrd!!!)</i> <br>
  &nbsp;This is a <b><i><u>super saturated solution</u></i></b> . Add a little 
  alcohol to dissolve the skin again, and add 20 ml of acetone <br>
  Then&nbsp; cover and set in freezer, as the temperature drops,&nbsp; crystals 
  will form . <br>
  Leave in freezer for 6 to 12 hours or even longer. Generally the longer in the 
  freezer&nbsp; the bigger and better will be the crystals. <br>
  The chili re-crystallizes as the temperature drops, the alcohol won't freeze. 
  <br>
  As time goes on the crystals&nbsp; &quot;digest&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i><u>Digestion</u></i></b>&nbsp; 
  means the crystals are slowly re-modeled,&nbsp; the outer layers with impurities 
  are stripped away a reform without the impurities. In addition the smaller crystals 
  dissolve and&nbsp; become incorporated into the larger crystals because of volume(cubic) 
  versus surface area(square) considerations <br>
  After which the resulting crystals were quickly cold&nbsp;&nbsp; filtered , 
  washed with a little cold alcohol&nbsp; and dried. <br>
  The crystals should be rinsed lightly with alcohol&nbsp; to wash off any of 
  the mother liquor that is stuck to the crystals, and to remove the outer layer 
  of crystal which is slightly impure for even better results: <br>
  The super saturated solution(dissolved in hot solvent) forms crystals faster 
  than the hot but more dilute solution , but the more dilute allows better digestion 
  and more pure crystals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
  …since the results were so favorable with the hydro-chloro-fluoro carbon group. 
  Somehow this involves the single-double bond but since none of the researchers 
  are true chemists...No amount of planning will ever replace dumb luck. WaredItGo 
  set out in search of everything that contained the word ethane/ethylene/chloro/fluoro.....etc...etc...blah 
  blah! Well there is a product that was brought back and tested that was aquired 
  at the autoparts store(several...as a matterafact)This product is used in cleaning 
  brakeparts.....it contains tetrachloroethylene and Co2. WoooooooooooooHoooooooooo...WATTS 
  that SMELL? Damn....feels like We're buzzin around the Dry-Cleaners. SQUEAKY 
  CLEAN! Well....thare ya have it! Thare is still room for investigation and testing, 
  but it is pretty straightfoward and SupER EasY! No A/B! No Water! No Elaborate 
  set-up! Humblebee didn't want me to post this cause it may mean an end to the 
  p-fed as we know it. Stay-tuned for the procedure in Part Two of &quot;Warediditallgoright?&quot;<br>
  Peace<br>
  Have Fun-Bee Safe</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">1)using tetra...you need the pill mass 
  to be completely in contact with the solution. If any does not dissolve in the 
  treatment...it will go through and foil you in the end. MAKE SURE you are crushing 
  your pills thoroughly to a fine powder....and soak....<br>
  2)pour off the tetra using ONE!!!! filter to get yer pill/p-fed mass. If you 
  use more than one filter....you will trap the poly's in the pill mass that you 
  are keeping.<br>
  SQUEEZE off the excess tetra liquid while it's in the filter...you will be left 
  with a ball.<br>
  3)Now you have to break this mass up and allow to dry to rid the pill mass of 
  the DryCleaning smell.<br>
  4)Then you dissolve in Alcohol of choice...This stage the pill mass/alc MUST 
  be filtered very well allowing no cloudiness to pass through....If it's cloudy...you 
  may be getting some plastics in the mix. The foiling polys are gone but the 
  plastics/wax and shit is in yer pill mass. DONOT keep pulling this past the 
  PINWHEEL crystal stage cause you are pulling GAAK.....SWIW finds that a three 
  time Alky Extract of the pill mass gives a 95% yeild! If this technique works 
  on generic ACTAFOOL and ALLFEDUP( &lt;names changed to protect the innocent) 
  It will work on anything out thare. SWIW just pulled 120's ER using this method 
  with great results...all that remains is the jacuzzi test! within the next 48........<br>
  ANY bees that are A/Bing yer pills are wasting chems and time and energy. But 
  if you must..............!<br>
  IBEEWARE stands behind this method 100% and garantees you won't be sorry! He's

<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grind the pills in a coffee grinder 
    until they are a fine powder. (Unless using 12 hr. These are placed inside 
    a metal sifter which is then place into a bowl full of acetone. After several 
    minutes the casings will split open. Shake the sifter and the insides fall 
    down into the bowl and the shell are left behind to be disposed of).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Take powder and place in a beaker 
    large enough to hold 3 times vol of powder.&nbsp; Next pour 2X powder vol 
    of Tolulene onto the powder and stir thoroughly. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do a 15 min boil.&nbsp; Decant and 
    repeat one more time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Dry Completely</b> (Hint: try not 
    to power or stir up contents very much. When dry, run the poweder through 
    the sifter again. This will remove more gaak that the Tolulene help extract).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do the same as above except with Acetone 
    (Remember that Acetone boils BELOW 150° F, so&nbsp; think a little!) Repeat 
    at least one more time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Drain off Acetone and <b>dry completely</b>!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once dry, pour 3X vol of alcohol of 
    choice onto the pill mass and place in freezer for 20 – 30 min.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Decant alc off through 3 coffee filters 
    + a cotton ball stuffed into the bottom o the funnel into a drying pan and

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">It works 
  similarly whether the pfed </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">(or Go-Go)<i> 
  is dissolved in water or alcohol. Not quite the same, but similar. Water,in 
  SWIG's experience, needs to be evaporated closer to dryness before flooding 
  than alcohol does. Acetone crashing is not a substitute for evaporation as much 
  as a last step. <br>
  <br>
  With alcohol,evaporate to the point that the surface skins over but before the 
  surface &quot;alligators&quot; or greatly wrinkles up. Flood the alcohol with 
  acetone all at once, at least enough to cover the contents in the bowl about 
  3 times it depth. (You can add acetone if you were evaporating too fast, the 
  bowl is too hot, and too much acetone boils off.) The acetone will sizzle and 
  boil like mad at first, then settle to a steady boil as the bowl cools. During 
  this time, swirling the hot acetone helps free any pfed </i>(or Go-Go)<i> stuck 
  to the bottom or sides. (If you evaporated too long, you will need to crush 
  any clumps of pfed in the hot actetone with a glass rod, a gloved finger, etc.) 
  <br>
  <br>
  When evaporating an water-pfed </i>(or Go-Go)<i> solution, SWIG lets it evaporate 
  even more, until the skin is heavily alligatored and almost all of the water 
  is gone. There will still be some fluid under the skin if the bowl is tilted, 
  but not a lot. Heat should be reduced after the solutions skins over, but well 
  before dryness. SWIG flashes before total dryness, but not much before. He tries 
  to avoid tilting the bowl so much that the pfed </i>(or Go-Go)<i> cakes on the 
  sides of the bowl before flooding with acetone. <br>
  <br>
  If there is too much water remaining when the solution is flooded with acetone, 
  some pfed (</i>or Go-Go) <i>will remain dissolved in the water and the pfed 
  </i>(or Go-Go)<i> that crashes out will be wet. These crystals will dissolve 
  into a paste. Too much water will make filtering meaningless--as it cools, you 
  will the have the same mess on each side of the filter. Both sides will have 
  too much water still. You will have to do it over. Add water to dissolve, evaporate 
  again, flash again. <br>
  <br>
  Flashing is like tightening up a plumbing connection. There is a quarter of 
  a turn between too loose and too tight. You have to develop a feel for when 
  the solution is dry enough to flash, just like you have to have a feel for how 
  tight is &quot;tight enough.&quot; How dry your acetone is, how cold it is, 
  how hot your evaporating dish is, how dry you pfed </i>(or Go-Go)<i> solution 
  is-- are all variables. Control as many as you can for consistent results. <br>
  <br>
  Flashed with the right amount of acetone at the right dryness of the solution, 
  you will get nice white sparkly crystals of pfed </i>(or Go-Go)<i> and brownish, 
  trashy acetone. Rinse the crystals with cold dry acetone to get any remaining 
  acid or other trash out.</i></font></font></p>

  Be damn careful heating the solution. Make sure you have that wet towel handy 
  and have a proper fire extinguisher. If you do not believe me, be sure you have 
  insurance. Do not breathe the fumes when it burns, friend. Notice I said when, 
  not if. When you have fire belching from the push pull tank and fire blowing 
  out the end of the hose, remember someone did tell you to have that towel handy.

<h3><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><a name="_Toc1036123"><i>--Excerpt from 
  The Hive</i></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Congrats. Does seem remarkably easy, 
  does it not?<br>
  <br>
  Things SWIG said to me about this synth:<br>
  <br>
  1) Concentrate that hypo some. It works. Really does. Big difference. Diff between 
  50% and 80% returns.<br>
  <br>
  2) UTFSE and read the posts on hypo. Look for the little pointers.<br>
  <br>
  3) Be damn careful heating the solution. Make sure you have that wet towel handy 
  and have a proper fire extinguisher. If you do not believe me, be sure you have 
  insurance. Do not breathe the fumes when it burns, friend. Notice I said when, 
  not if. When you have fire belching from the push pull tank and fire blowing 
  out the end of the hose, remember someone did tell you to have that towel handy. 
  It isn't a matter of if, it is more like when. <br>
  <br>
  4) This synth needs very little, if any heat. SWIG has had 70% returns with 
  minimal heating. <br>
  <br>
  5) Dry iodine is a plus. Wet iodine is a minus.<br>
  <br>
  6) Use an excess of hypo. Go 1.2 to 1 Hypo to E, maybe a little more. You will 
  not need to add. <br>
  <br>
  7) Add the iodine in intervals. <i>(author’s note:  if done in intervals, the 
  reaction is opened up to the world and you are then exposed to is possible dangers.  
  Do it all at once)</i>Be patient. Wait for that finished smell. If that smell 
  does not come and if the solution stays golden and not yellow, think about adding 
  a little more hypo. You still have iodine present. <br>
  <br>
  8) Yes, it is perfect for the nano cook. <br>
  <br>
  9) You can blow it, get no return, or get lousy, half reacted dope. But you 
  have to be sloppy to do it. <br>
  <br>
  10) Yes, use naptha and kerplunk. It does improve the gear. Amazing? yes. One 
  pull and you're done? Easy.<br>
  <br>
  11) Isn't it nice to see stuff this clean and pretty at the start? No burn, 
  very little rush. Pure go and get it done stuff. Smooth as it can be. No teeth 
  ground down. Up for days.<br>
  <br>
  12) Understand no one believes this synth works. Accept it. It really is a trade 
  secret. <br>
  <br>
  13) SWIG says he is keeping notes for a start to finish nano write up when he 
  feels like he has this really down. He does maybe one a week. Wanna help the 
  write-up?<br>
