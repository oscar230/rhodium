<h2>MDP2P from Isosafrole via Epoxide Intermediate</h2>
<h4>by Osmium</h4>

</div>

<div class="stdtxt">

<p>Isosafrole in acetonitrile + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol + sodium carbonate (pH 8-10.5), at 10-45�C for 20h gives 94% isosafrole epoxide<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>.
This can be rearranged to MDP2P in about 90% overall yield. Possibly this could also work with straight safrole.</p>

<p>I don't have more info than this, but if I were to perform this reaction, I would try the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="oli">Prepare a solution of isosafrole in 5-10 times the volume CH<sub>3</sub>CN.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Add a slight molar excess of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to MeOH (same volume as above), add Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> until pH is 8-10.5.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Place the MeOH solution into a water bath and slowly add the CH<sub>3</sub>CN solution of isosafrole.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Stir for a day.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Remove the solvents under vacuum.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Extract the residue with an organic solvent, wash with water, dry if necessary, and evaporate.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Dissolve the residue in 10 volumes ethyl acetate, add a few percent LiI or LiBr.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Reflux for a day.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Wash the solvent with water to extract the Li salts (recycle), dry solvent, evaporate.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Residue should be MDP2P, further purification probably a waste of time.</span></li>

<h4>Theory</h4>

<div class="pic right">
<p><b>Radziszewski reaction:</b></p>
<img src="pictures/acetonitrile.peroxide.gif">
</div>

<p>In alkaline solution, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduces the intermediate peroxy acid to the amide with the liberation of oxygen, but at pH 8 no oxygen is evolved and
the solution of peroxycarboximidic acid can be used to oxidize an olefin to its epoxide<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. Too much hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the acetonitrile to acetamide.</p>

<p>A low-cost method for epoxidation of cyclohexene is by dropwise addition of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NaOH to a stirred mixture of cyclohexene, methanol, and
acetonitrile at 60�C, the yield of cyclohexene oxide is 85%<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h4>Dimethyldioxirane Epoxidation of anethole and asarone<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a></h4>

<p>Dimethyldioxirane solution in acetone was made freshly by an improved conventional method<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. After the solution was dried with molecular sieves (4 �, activated powder),
it was titrated iodometically with KI and starch. The titrated dimethyldioxirane solution (~0.08 M solution in acetone, 1.2 equiv.) was added to <em>trans</em>-anethole or <em>trans</em>-asarone
in dry acetone (1 ml for 1 mmol) at 0�C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford
the epoxides. <em>trans</em>-anethole oxide was a colorless oil. The yellow oil of <em>trans</em>-asarone oxide after vacuum application was dissolved in dry hexane and recrystallized at �20�C for
a few days to produce a white solid product (mp. 37�40�C). The yields of these oxides were >95%. The oxides were kept at �80�C in dry nitrogen. In this condition <em>trans</em>-anethole
oxide was stable for 1 year and <em>trans</em>-asarone oxide was stable for 1 month.</p>

<h4>Purity of trans-anethole oxide and trans-asarone oxide</h4>

<p><i>trans</i>-anethole oxide and <em>trans</em>-asarone oxide were found to have very pure NMR spectra with little or no impurity peaks. The yields of oxides from this method were >95%, which are
much better than those of Mohan and Whalen<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> and Greca et al.<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> whose methods used <em>m</em>-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to oxidize anethole or asarone and gave yields of 38 and 52%, respectively.</p>

<h4>Stability of trans-anethole oxide and trans-asarone oxide</h4>

<p>Both of the oxides were stable in acetone or DMSO for 1 h at 0 or 37�C. In aqueous environments, however, the amount of these epoxides declined, presumably because of their hydration
to diols. The half-life of <em>trans</em>-anethole oxide was 7.6 min in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37�C. The presence of 154 mM KCl lowered the half-life to 4.2 min.
<em>trans</em>-Asarone oxide showed shorter half-lives; 4.0 min without or 2.4 min with 154 mM KCl.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h4>trans-Anethole Oxide<a href="safrolepoxide.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a></h4>

<p>To a well-stirred biphasic mixture of 2.0 g of <em>trans</em>-anethole in 60 mL of methylene chloride and 60 mL of 10% sodium carbonate in water in an icewater
bath was added a solution of 5.6 g of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (85%, 0.028 mol) in 60 mL of methylene chloride over a period of 2.5 h by means of a syringe pump assembly. The methylene
chloride layer was separated, washed with 10% sodium carbonate solution (3x25 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (25 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of the
solvent on a rotary evaporator yielded 1.94 g of oil that was distilled in a short path distillation apparatus (45�C oil bath, 0.1 mmHg) to yield 0.84 g (38%) of <em>trans</em>-Anethole Oxide.</p>
