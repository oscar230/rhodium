<p style="text-align: right;"><b>- Jonathan Swift</b></p>
</div>


<p>The variety of drugs currently involved in the drug abuse problem is very extensive. As these materials become better defined and their use better 
controlled, they will be replaced with substitute compounds, which will provide society with new, unknown, and unmanageable substances. Currently, the 
authorities assume that the drug abuse situation has reached its fullest degree of complexity. Therefore, logic would demand that the solution to this 
problem would lie in an accurate definition of the materials involved, the construction of an adequately worded prohibition, and the provision of sufficient 
force to guarantee these prohibitions. Unfortunately, the rapid growth and spread of socially unacceptable uses of drugs indicate that this assumption may 
not be accurate.</p>

<p>This paper will attempt to explore a second possible approach to the problem, one based upon an outline of the rather frightening horizons which may well be
encountered by our society. Within this framework, an attempt is made to anticipate the many directions to which the drug-oriented subculture might turn, to
foresee as many of these future chemical and pharmacologic pathways as possible, and through such predictions suggest a means of preparing ourselves to 
recognize and come to grips with future problems.</p>

<p>One must recognize the obvious negative aspect of such an approach. Clearly, there will be made available an itemization of potentially interesting avenues 
of financially profitable drug exploration. However, very few who are deeply invested in the preparation of illicit drugs will learn much that they do not 
already know or that could easily ire learned from the scientific literature. One who makes a correct prediction in an area of social malaise in which the
attendant misfortunes are direct consequences of human inventiveness, will run the grave risk of having created a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>Individual compounds and materials such as alcohol, cocaine, or tobacco are unique, and any attempt to predict their changing roles as drugs of abuse must 
be predicated on altered law, social custom, and economics rather than on their chemistry and pharmacology. It is possible, however, that technological 
extrapolation is valid when considering certain pharmacologic families of drugs, such as the opiates, the amphetamines, the barbiturates, and the 
hallucinogens.</p>

<p>The raw material for such technologic predictions is available in the scientific literature. In every issue of the journals in the fields of pharmacology, 
medicinal chemistry, the botanical sciences, and biochemistry, articles appear that advertise the isolation, synthesis, or evaluation of materials which 
have some pharmacologic action. Any article describing a new family of compounds ("<i>Potential Centrally Active Stimulants Evaluated in Experimental Animals</i>,"
for example) will encourage an unknown number of synthetic repetitions by underground researchers and manufacturers (with immediate pharmacologic evaluation 
in man). These studies follow none of the recognized guidelines for clinical investigation and are not responsible to any regulatory agency. If the results 
are undesirable or unacceptable, the matter is forgotten. If the results are considered virtuous or marketable, a new product appears briefly, under some 
popularly recognizable name and achieves, de facto, a broadly based "clinical" evaluation. When the product survives this initial marketing experiment, a 
new drug problem has made its appearance on the drug-abuse scene. However, if the product proves unacceptable (dysphoric, debilitating, lethal), the inquiry 
is dropped. Such explorations continue outside of the awareness of the social body politic.</p>

<p>Even more disturbing, and less easily anticipated, are the novel pharmaceutic agents that may spring forth from the imagination and wit of the illicit 
manufacturer himself. He does not advertise the substances of his inventions, nor does he warn others of his failures. The scientific community discovers 
these sallies sometimes years after their success or failure. In any events, there are few opportunities to cope with the problems when they are real; many 
of them without doubt pass from the scene completely unrecognized.</p>

<p>These potentially expandable families are discussed here within the framework of present day pharmacologic knowledge.</p>

<div class="stdtxt">
<h2>Opiates</h2>

<p>The term "opiates" takes on a number of different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In the strictest sense, it refers to those 
materials isolated from the opium poppy <em>Papaver somniferum</em>. The total extract is known as opium, which can be used as such, as the dry mixture of the salts 
(<em>Pantopon</em>), or as a tincture (<em>Laudanum</em>). The principal medically recognized component materials are morphine and its methyl ether, codeine. A number of
additional alkaloids are present, probably the most valuable of which is thebaine, a chemical precursor of other active drugs. In a somewhat looser chemical 
sense, the term "opiates" has come to refer to those drugs derived from chemicals originating within the opium poppy. The best examples are heroin, which 
is a diacetyl derivative of morphine, the numerous clinically recognized members of the morphinone and codeinone group, and the less well studied but
exceptionally potent adducts of thebaine.</p>

<p>In the popular pharmacologic sense, the term "opiates" must be extended to embrace any drug, regardless of chemical origins, that can be substituted for 
morphine or heroin in abuse potential. Thus, the family is extended to embrace a host of drugs patterned after some part of the paradigm molecule, morphine, 
but which are totally independent of any botanical origins.</p>

<p>The only way an investigator can be certain that an individual has indeed been exposed to heroin or morphine is through analysis of the subject's urine. 
A recent study<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> has shown that under continuous application of heroin at pharmacologically active levels, no detectable blood levels could be found at 
any stage of the experiment. The search failed not only for heroin per se, but for the expected metabolites, monoacetylmorphine, and morphine itself. Urine 
levels are easily detected and constitute the basis of a large number of screening procedures designed to detect heroin usage<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a>, but as the 
principle heroin metabolite is excreted predominantly as a water-soluble conjugate, a preliminary hydrolytic step is mandatory before usual extraction 
procedures can provide quantities sufficient for the determination of drug use. This emphasis is important because when a large-scale move from heroin to a 
heroin-surrogate occurs in our society, it will be only through a change of metabolite pattern that this substitution will be detected. Only such analytical 
evidence will reveal the nature and extent of the "opiate" drug abuse problem.</p>

<p>The term "when" rather than "if" heroin substitutes appear is used intentionally, for this transformation seems economically inevitable<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. The 
poppy plant from which heroin is obtained grows primarily in the Near or Far East. The plant-produced opium is processed to morphine, which is then converted 
synthetically into the diacetyl derivative. It is this latter material that is imported into the United States. The current approach to the control of 
heroin usage is through interference with the importation of this product. As this restriction becomes increasingly effective, and without a corresponding 
decrease in demand, the drive to create alternative materials that are not opium dependent will grow.</p>

<p>Many of the very effective substitutes for morphine (and to some extent valid as heroin substitutes) are in fact chemically derived from opium alkaloids as 
a starting material and therefore do not meet these requirements. A large family of synthetic derivatives of thebaine, however, is an exception; although 
they are dependent upon the P. somniferum for the original starting materials, they are intensely potent in humans. As a consequence of the 10,000x increase 
of potencies obtainable from such chemical transformations, the manufacture of these drugs as morphine substitutes would be economically feasible in spite 
of successful restrictions on the importation of the raw chemical materials. One of the principle alkaloids of opium [thebaine, <b>1</b>, present to approximately 
1% in raw opium, and itself a convulsant rather than a narcotic] can be converted through simple chemical modification into chemicals with a new six-ring 
system that shows extremely high morphinomimetic activity. These compounds, after demethylation to the oripavine analog, can be obtained with wide 
substitutional variation on either the nitrogen [R<sup>1</sup>, in <b>2</b>] or on the new ring generated [vide, R<sup>2</sup> in <b>2</b>].</p>

<p>A large variety of compounds have been prepared with the nitrogen substituent kept as an N-methyl as is found in morphine, but with exercise of chemical 
flexibility at the R<sup>2</sup> substituent<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. Janssen and van der Eycken<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> have reviewed the pharmacology of these materials, which have been found to exceed morphine in 
potency by four full orders of magnitude.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future01.gif"></div>

<p>Ethorphine [M-99, <b>2</b>] with R<sup>1</sup> = CH<sub>3</sub> and R<sup>2</sup> = -C(OH)(CH<sub>3</sub>) (propyl) and the O-acetyl derivative Acetorphine (M-183) have been used as 
immobilizing agents in the capture of wild animals, and are acknowledged as being capable of leading to a high degree of physical dependence in humans<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Currently, much pharmacologic research is being devoted to the development of antagonists to the action of morphine and heroin, and to the many substances 
that have showed similar activity. The interests in this area are manyfold. The principal clinical utility of such research is to develop a therapeutic 
antidote to an overdosage of one of these narcotics. Secondarily, there have been studies that have shown value as a titration tool for the documentation 
of recent usage of one of the narcotic agents (through the precipitation of withdrawal effects following chemical challenge). More recently, the use of 
antagonists has been evaluated as an insurance against improper parenteral use of morphine-like substances by their incorporation into medicinal 
preparations as built-in antidotes. This virtue depends upon assumption that these "antagonists" themselves are without activity. Recent reports on many 
of the classes to be discussed in the morphine group suggest that there is certainly some abuse potential in these "antagonists" as well as within the 
classes to be antagonized. In general, it has been with the introduction of some homolog of methyl, on the nitrogen, that has led to antagonistic activity. 
In the ethenooripavine group discussed here, the introduction of an N-cyclopropylmethyl group (and an isopropanol group at R<sup>2</sup>) has produced a morphine 
antagonist with many times the potency of the paradigm, nalorphine (N-allylmorphine)<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. Yet, this drug, (Cyprenorphine, M-285) has been shown to be 
hallucinogenic in the naive subject at less than a milligram dose<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>. The first morphine antagonist based on the benzomorphan system (see below) was the 
N-cyclopropyl homolog, Cyclazocine. Although this material is effective against opium intoxication, it also shows some narcotic action in naive subjects. 
The dosage for effective antagonism may have to be established gradually due to the "unpleasant initial side effects-which include-hallucinations"<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>. 
These exceptions are noted merely to emphasize the fact that many of the synthetic peripheral areas associated with the morphine line of chemistry have 
the potential for producing "socially undesirable side-effects" which are, in fact, the very virtues that are abusable in the drug-oriented subculture being 
considered here.</p>

<p>The largest area from which future drugs related to heroin might emerge is that which is completely independent of any opium sources. Many completely 
synthetic substitutes for morphine have been prepared and evaluated, and all of them are potentially available from domestic origins. Most of these are 
simplifications of the parent morphine carbon skeleton, in which the analgetic (and consistently, the euphorigenic) properties have been maintained. The 
principal classes are shown, with both the pictorial resemblance to the original morphine structure and the more conventional presentation.</p>

<p>The tetracyclic analogs of morphine, the morphinans, were first explored by Grewe<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> who found that the parent compound N-methylmorphinan 
[<b>3</b>, R<sup>1</sup> = H, R<sup>2</sup> = CH<sub>3</sub>]<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> was about one-fifth the potency of morphine. The hydroxy analog was synthesized<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> 
and a more general synthetic method for this family appeared shortly<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>. The analgesia, but also the dependence liability potential, was found to 
accompany the levo-isomers of these compounds, the orientation that imitates morphine. Much emphasis has been placed upon the dextro-isomers in, that they 
maintain the antitussive related clinical virtues without any of the central activity associated with the parent compound, morphine. Thus, dextromethorphan 
is a commercially promoted antitussive sold under a host of names such as Vicks-44, Robitussin-DM, Dextrotussin, etc. However there is an extensive abuse 
potential and indeed a real abuse associated with the misuse of these agents. The broad availability of dextromethorphan has promoted the misuse of this 
chemical, and its name has entered the popular ethic of abusive potential. The racemic synthetic mixture, of course, carries both dextro-potential and the 
<em>levo</em>-factual morphine action. Many compounds with disubstitution on the aromatic ring<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a> are active, but it is with the variation on nitrogen that 
the fullest range of morphinomimetic potency has been realized.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future02.gif"></div>

<p>Many dozens of morphinan analogs have been synthesized and compared directly with morphine in a number of species as a centrally active analgesic<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a>. 
Among the most active derivatives were the phenethylamine analogs and a number of related aromatic systems. Several compounds that were highly active in 
rodent screening [such as R<sup>2</sup> = p-aminophenethyl and furanylethyl, R<sup>1</sup> = OH, in <strong>3</strong>] maintained a potency of 20 to 40x that of morphine in primate evaluation. 
If these potencies should extrapolate to humans (for which there is much precedent) and if the euphorigenic properties continue to accompany the analgesic 
properties (a generality with only rare exception), then submilligram amounts should serve as satisfactory heroin substitutes. It must be remembered that 
this family, and all following materials discussed in the framework of heroin substitutes, are chemicals that are readily synthesizable from commercially 
available, and uncontrolled, starting materials. Many substitutions have been explored on the aromatic ring of the phenethylamine substitution (see 1171) 
and virtually all are equal to, or exceed, morphine in effectiveness. The potential for illicit mischief here is enormous.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future03.gif"></div>

<p>Brief mention will be made of a simpler, tricyclic, family of morphine substitutes, the benzomorphans (<strong>4</strong>). These chemicals were initially explored by May 
and Murphy<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a> and appear to represent the clinically desirable features of analgesia without the usual accompanying dependence liability or undesirable 
side effects<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a>. And as it is just these latter two properties that would be needed for satisfactory heroin replacement, the possibilities of abuse is 
considerably less. As With morphinans, it is again through variations of the N-substituent that the widest expression of potency and effectiveness has been 
achieved. One of these derivatives [<strong>4</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = OH, R<sup>2</sup> = dimethylallyl, R<sup>3</sup> = R<sup>4</sup> = CH<sub>3</sub>, pentazocine, Talwin] has achieved wide clinical utility as an analgesic, 
and in fact its apparent freedom from abuse liability<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>20</sup></a> allowed it to be marketed without any of the controls associated with narcotics. However, there 
is a growing body of literature to indicate that there is an abuse potential associated with the drug<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a>. Although the dependence-producing potential has 
been vigorously attacked<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a> there are reports of clear hallucinogenesis associated with its use<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a>. A similar analgesic, Cyclazocine, has an 
N-cyclopropylmethyl group, and has reported sideeffects of confusion and euphoria<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Further simplification of the ring systems of morphine leads to three bicyclic systems that carry an immense potential for future exploitation as potential 
heroin substitutes. One of these is represented by <strong>5</strong> with R<sup>2</sup> some carboxylate ester: this group can be called the meperidine family. The second has the 
ester function reversed, with R<sup>2</sup> being an esterified carbinol; this group can be called the prodine family, or simply the reversed esters. The third is a 
"nonester" analog, ketone function at R<sup>2</sup>; this can be called the ketobemidone family.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future04.gif"></div>

<p>Meperidine [<strong>5</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = H, R<sup>2</sup> = CH<sub>3</sub>, R<sup>3</sup> = CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, R<sup>4</sup> = H] is a broadly used clinical drug with clear morphine-like properties, which serves to define this 
family. It was first prepared<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>25</sup></a> in a search for atropine substitutes. Its potency is somewhat less than that of morphine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>26</sup></a>, but it maintains the 
dependency liability acid several other. of the clinically undesirable properties of morphine. As noted in both morphinan and the benzomorphan families 
above, it is through modification of the substituent on the nitrogen that a broad expansion of potency has been noted in the meperidine group. An excellent 
structure-activity relationship study of these compounds has been prepared<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, with some potencies many thousands that of morphine having been reported. 
Meperidine itself has been shown to be cross-tolerant with heroin both physiologically and psychologically<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>27</sup></a> and there is no reason not to expect its 
more potent but uncontrolled analogs to be similar. A quotation from a recent textbook is timely<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>28</sup></a>:</p>


<blockquote>
     <p><i>"Only a few of the more than 4000 chemically modified meperidine structures have received clinical acceptance; some of these, especially 
     meperidine itself, are useful drugs, but unfortunately none show the desired separation of strong analgesic potency from unwanted side effects."</i></p>
</blockquote>


<p>It must be borne in mind that from the point of view of heroin substitution and illicit drug usage, it is exactly this constellation of "unwanted 
side effects" that is in fact desirable. Thus, there are just short of 4000 chemicals already synthetically described and clinically documented in the 
scientific literature which might well serve as future drugs of abuse.</p>

<p>The closely related family of the prodine-like compounds or the "reversed esters" are represented by the structure <strong>5</strong> with R<sup>2</sup> = OCOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> rather than 
R<sup>2</sup> = COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. Interestingly, this simple transformation on meperidine itself increases the potency of the molecule some 20-fold<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> and maintains a 
cross-tolerance to heroin, although there seems to be some reservation as to its acceptability as a heroin substitute in illicit usage<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. In common with 
the meperidine group, variations on the nitrogen atom have produced a wealth of active analogs with activities of literally thousands of times that of the 
parent molecule<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>29</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In the reversed ester family, the inclusion of a methyl group in the three-position of the piperidine ring gives rise to compounds of potency (and of 
dependence liability) equivalent to that of morphine. These materials are called <em>alpha</em>-prodine (with the R<sup>4</sup> methyl group <em>cis</em> to the propionyloxy group at 
R<sup>3</sup>) and <em>beta</em>-prodine (with a <em>trans</em> relationship). The latter is the more potent, and has had some clinical use where its rapid onset and short duration of 
action is of value<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>30</sup></a>. Again, variations on the nitrogen of this family has led to compounds with many orders of magnitude more potency than morphine, 
and thus with a corresponding abuse potential.</p>

<p>The third bicyclic morphine imitation is represented by a ketonic carbonyl in position R<sup>3</sup> of <strong>5</strong>. The principle drug in this classification is 
ketobemidone [<strong>5</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = OH, R<sup>2</sup> = CH<sub>3</sub>, R<sup>3</sup> = COCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, and R<sup>4</sup> = H]. A number of analogs of ketobemidone have been studied in which the nitrogen substituent 
has been varied, and several of these are of increased potency<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>, but there has been no systematic study of this area as can be found with the 
methadone and the reversedester families.</p>

<p>The simplest morphine imitations that can be seriously considered as potential heroin substitutes are the monocyclic analogs, in which even the 
piperidine ring is opened. This is most conveniently referred to as the "methadone" family. This chemical group was apparently first uncovered by Bockmuhl 
in Germany during World War II<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>31</sup></a> in efforts to find pharmacologic substitutes for morphine. The most direct syntheses of methadone (and the procedures 
that are most likely to be employed by illicit chemists) involve diphenylacetonitrile<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>32,33</sup></a> and lead to a mixture of the desired product [methadone and 
isomethadone, isomers with the methyl group located in one or the other of the two, indicated positions in <strong>6</strong>]. Both isomers are active as morphine-like 
pharmaceutical agents, although the alpha-methyl compound has been accepted as being of a higher therapeutic safety value. Illicit methadone production as 
a heroin substitute is apt to be found as a mixture, as the separation is troublesome, and the two isomers are not grossly different pharmacologically. A 
variation of the isomethadone (<strong>7</strong>) structure, with reversed ester structure at R3 [<strong>6</strong>, R<sup>3</sup> = OCOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, and R<sup>4</sup> = CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) is the analgesic propoxyphene 
(Darvon). It is not under narcotics control, and has not yet shown appreciable abuse potential. Although little exploratory work has been done modifying 
the structure of methadone, three areas of chemical and clinical interest are noteworthy. One, the reduction of the ketonic carbonyl group to a carbinol 
group and the corresponding acetylation of it leads to the acetylmethadol group of compounds, which seem to be of comparable activity, but with slower onset 
of action, and of longer duration<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>34</sup></a>. This compound is now being explored quite widely in substitution for methadone in the area of methadone maintenance 
and methadone withdrawal in heroin recovery clinics<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>35</sup></a>. No chemical extrapolation of this promising lead has been reported.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future05.gif"></div>

<p>A second area of methadone structure modification has been reported<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>36</sup></a> in which the quaternary carbon [in <strong>6</strong>, carrying R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>4</sup>] has been replaced by 
nitrogen. Two clinically accepted drugs have resulted, phenampromide (<strong>8</strong>) and diampromide, which have potencies comparable with meperidine, but which have 
similar capability for the generation of dependence.</p>

<p>A third area of morphine-like activity has been found with substitution upon the nitrogen atom of methadone. A series of 4,4-gemdisubstituted piperidinyl 
analogs have been found<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> to be some 1500 times as potent as methadone, and to be quite a bit longer acting. There are no studies of these chemicals in 
humans, but there is certainly represented here a rich area of potential chemical exploration. An outgrowth of this line of exploration is the development 
and clinical evaluation of morphine-like analgesics such as Fentanyl (<strong>9</strong>) (active in humans as a narcotic at about 25 &micro;g intravenously) and its 
isopropylamine analog, which is about twice as active. The exquisite reasoning that has produced this logical development of drugs is apparent from the 
comparison of their structures below:</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future06.gif"></div>

<p>There is no reason to expect that all materials that might appear as potential heroin substitutes must be based on the structure of morphine. Many of 
the very active compounds such as meperidine and methadone have only the most remote resemblance to the parent alkaloid. Many compounds have sprung forth 
with little if any relationship to known pharmacologic logic, and have been found to be analgesic (as compared with morphine) and to have, most strangely, 
the dependence-producing capability of morphine. For example, dimethylthiambutene (<strong>10</strong>)<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>34</sup></a> is clinically well compared with meperidine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>38</sup></a>. Yet this 
material achieved illicit usage in Japan and provided clear demonstrations of addiction<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future07.gif"></div>

<p>A further extension of this non-resemblance to morphine is seen in the structures of a number of benzimidazoles that have proven to be similar to 
morphine in potency as central analgesics. A highly potent derivative (<strong>11</strong>) has about a thousand times the potency of morphine, but the respiratory 
depression and the proclivity to develop de ndence were much the same as is seen for morphine and heroin<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>39</sup></a>. Therefore, although this line of chemistry 
is not clearly productive in the clinical area, it is nonetheless a fertile field for the search for heroin substitutes that can be domestically synthesized 
and are potent at levels that would encourage illicit investigation. Two analogs of this family have been recognized and documented in the scheduled drugs 
list as materials with high abuse potential and without redeeming medical utility; these are the compounds with a para-chloro group (Clonitazene) and a 
para-ethoxygroup (Etonitazene) as substituents of the phenyl group in <strong>11</strong>. (See the last section for a complete listing of all scheduled drugs as related 
to these chemical classifications.) This family seems to be quite versatile chemically<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>40</sup></a> but the most potent compounds still retain the dependence 
liability of morphine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>

<p>There seem to be many thousands of potential morphine and heroin substitutes, of which some few score are listed in the registry of scheduled drugs, 
presented at the end of this paper. Clearly, to list all possible future abusable drugs would be a hopelessly laborious undertaking, and to list 
generalized families would compromise the many necessary drugs that are presently being used clinically.</p>

</div>

<div class="stdtxt">
<h2>Stimulants</h2>

<p>A second, and probably as large an area of drug abuse reality and drug abuse potential, is the category that can be called the drugs of stimulation. 
This is a most delicate classification, as, although there are a large number of recognized stimulants (pharmacologically, sympathomimetic agents), all of 
the pharmaceutical houses have found a number of alternate and less suggestive classifications for their products. These are drugs that can "clear the nasal 
passages, suppress the appetite, or alleviate depression" but that are not in themselves "stimulants." In truth, all of the chemicals to be considered here 
can be used and have been used to better cope with social pressures and can thus be grouped together under the relatively unbiased term "analeptics."</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future08.gif"></div>

<p>The best defined and most extensively studied examples of this form of central stimulants are chemicals commonly referred to as amphetamines. The use of 
the plural term "amphetamines" is widespread, but it is ambiguous. The term "amphetamine" is a single specific compound, 1-phenyl-2-aminopropane (<strong>12</strong>) and 
the most restricted use of the term "amphetamines" applies to this chemical, either of its optical isomers, and generally the N-methyl homolog 
methamphetamine (<strong>13</strong>) and its isomers. A more general use has come into both legal and medical literature that considers that larger family that shares the 
common chemical carbon skeleton of the amphetamine molecule and that can in the pharmacologic sense serve as a substitute. A third usage, found in phrases 
such as "hallucinogenic amphetamines," refers to compounds exhibiting the basic carbon skeleton of the amphetamine molecule, but that are so separate in 
their pharmacologic expression that they can in no way be considered stimulants. They are discussed in the Hallucinogen section below.</p>

<p>Amphetamine, as the racemate and as its optical isomers, and the monomethyl homolog methamphetamine, are, without question, the most widely prescribed, 
used, and abused stimulants within this family. The awareness of this abuse is tacitly recognized by the transfer of all forms of these two chemicals from 
Schedule III to Schedule II in 1971<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>41</sup></a>. The extent of this abuse potential is apparent from the letter sent at that time<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>42</sup></a> to the registered 
pharmacists in the country, that listed by name (in an admittedly incomplete compilation) some 102 commercial forms of prescribable drugs containing only 
amphetamine or methamphetamine, and 291 additional drug forms that contain one or the other of these in combination with additional active ingredients. At 
least 393 separate brand names were at that time being produced by at least 204 independent manufacturers. There is no question that abuse of these two 
fundamental compounds will persist well into the future. They are easily synthesized, as attested to by their costs as chemicals (d-amphetamine, $25.35/100 
gm, and d-methamphetamine as desoxyephedrine hydrochloride, $13.65/100 gm)<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>43</sup></a>. This documents a foundation cost of perhaps 2 cents per dosage unit and 
would seem to assure the continued availability of the drugs, at least through illicit sources. The widely recognized precursor to both drugs is 
phenylacetone, which although being noted at all supply sources as a chemical potentially employed in the synthesis of controlled substances, is itself 
quite inexpensive (less than $10.00/lb) and is not by law a controlled chemical.</p>

<p>The broader use of the term "amphetamines," as defined above, embraces a large number of prescription stimulants, which have been justified by their 
manufacturers as being valuable for a broad range of deficiencies. The two general categories of action include use as antidepressants that brighten the 
mood and improve performance, and use as anorexogenics in case of obesity. It has been said that the effects of the appetite suppressants are actually 
  <em>"Those of central stimulation which may distract the patient from eating and encouraging dietary cooperation"</em><a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>44</sup></a>. Therefore, these two latter 
pharmacologic families actually become one. Additional clinical applications of these materials, such as the treatment of narcolepsy, the counteraction 
of other medications producing drowsiness, even the paradoxical employment in preadolescent behavior problems, apparently all depend principally upon their 
actions as a central stimulant. It is just this activity that provides their abuse reality and potential.</p>

<p>The future of drug abuse in the amphetamine-like stimulant group, and the drugs to be abused in the future, can be projected with some confidence from 
the development of the present problem. The earlier discussions of the narcotic analgesics indicate that there has been a major synthetic and clinical 
effort made to develop drugs that would maintain virtue (analgesia) while minimizing undesirable side effects (euphoria, physiologic dependence liability). 
An added impetus to this diversity has been the economic requirements associated with patents and proprietory rights of the developing research laboratories.
The same arguments apply to the stimulants. The search continues for products that fill clinical needs (anorexia, antidepression), minimize the potential 
for abuse (excitability, psychologic dependence liability), and are proprietary. It seems axiomatic that the hoped-for properties are always accompanied by 
the hoped-against properties. The degree to which a compound can provide relief from depression through stimulation is the degree to which the compound can 
be abused either through overuse or through chronic use.</p>

<p>The original amphetamine stimulants, amphetamine and methamphetamine, have been displaced by a number of chemically related drugs that have the 
phenylisopropylamine skeleton and that appear to varying extents to duplicate the action of amphetamine. Rather than establishing a class regulation (as 
has been done in Great Britain with the Drugs Act, 1964<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>45</sup></a>), the procedure followed has been to treat each drug individually and to move it from 
uncontrolled, to prescriptional availability, to appropriate scheduling in the Controlled Drugs structure as abuse reality became apparent. Thus 
amphetamine, used clinically since 1935<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>46</sup></a>, and methamphetamine received extraordinarily broad abuse both in the United States and abroad after World 
War II; they are now Schedule II drugs. Of the many substitutes for amphetamine that were prepared and evaluated in the post-war era, both methylphenidate 
[Ritalin, <strong>14</strong>] and phenmetrazine [Preludin, <strong>15</strong>] have been documented with sufficient misuse to warrant scheduling (to Schedule II, November 1971). As was 
mentioned in the substituted piperidine portion in the narcotics section, the concept of the reversed ester (the replacement of a [-COOR] group with the 
isometric [-OCOR] group with a retention of pharmacologic style of activity) also applies to the Ritalin molecule.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future09.gif"></div>

<p>The reversed ester of <strong>14</strong> is levophacetoperane, which is similar in action to Attalin (stimulant and antidepressant) and only slightly less potent in 
humans<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>47</sup></a>. This latter variant is relatively unexplored and of course legally unrecognized.</p>

<p>There are many additional amphetamine analogs that are commercially available upon prescription as antidepressants or anorexogenics, and that might well 
have the capability of being abused in the same manner as have been the others, but for which there have been as yet no indications of abuse. These include, 
among others, benzphetamine, phenteramine, phendimetrazine, diethylpropion, and a host of others still in the investigational stages. In the future, it is 
axiomatic that some of these will be misused, and so might become our future drugs of abuse.</p>

<p>A point of metabolic interest may be mentioned here, as it may serve as a clue to another class of potentially abusable stimulants. A frequently asked 
question is: How can one determine the extent of abuse of a specific drug? In cases of rampant and conspicuous abuse, there are many indications such as 
the sources of the drug, the overwriting of prescriptions, the thefts from druggists' suppliers, and the broadcast availability of illegally purchasable 
supplies on the street. But this would imply an already established abuse. To anticipate an abuse problem, it is necessary to anticipate these signs. And 
one of the potentially powerful tools for such previews is the unusual fact that, in humans, both amphetamine and the homolog methamphetamine are excreted 
in the urine to a large measure unmetabolized. This has been used as a device for screening the population for indications of the extent of amphetamine 
abuse. However, there are two completely unrelated classes of stimulants that are only superficially related to amphetamine chemically, but that are unusual 
in that they are cleaved through their normal metabolism into either amphetamine or methamphetamine. These are easily synthesized families and they appear 
to serve as substitutes for amphetamine in the call for stimulatory properties, and yet their abuse, as noted by the development of recognizable urinary 
metabolites, would be assigned to amphetamine.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future10.gif"></div>

<p>The first of these is illustrated by fenethylline [Captagon, <strong>16</strong>], which was first prepared some 10 years ago, and is now easily available in Europe as 
a nonprescription analeptic agent. It is apparently cleaved metabolically in humans into theophylline (a weak stimulant closely related to caffeine) and 
amphetamine, and it has been shown that the action of the parent drug may be correlated to the production of amphetamine <em>in vivo</em><a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>48</sup></a>. If this form of 
metabolic cleavage proves to be general, then any of a large number of stimulants can masquerade as covalently complexed materials that are physiologically 
available only through metabolic conversion.</p>

<p>A second type of abuse drug is suggested by the structure of the material Aponeuron [AN-1, <strong>17</strong>], which is prepared by the coalescence of amphetamine, 
benezaldehyde, and cyanide, and which apparently releases the contained amphetamine following introduction into the body<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>49,50</sup></a>. These chemical extensions 
are probably documentable in their abuse only through the appearance of amphetamine in analyzed urine samples. It will be of scientific as well as social 
interest to see if similar chemical manipulations (the conversion of a recognized and scheduled drug into a legally innocuous analog which will regenerate 
the original drug in vivo) might be extended to include the many structurally similar stimulants and hallucinogens.</p>

<p>Close relatives to these centrally active, sympathomimetic, amphetamine-like compounds are a growing number of simple bases employed as decongestants 
and agents of relief in asthma conditions. These are chemicals pharmacologically related to ephedrine (<strong>18</strong>) and largely imitate it in their capability in 
dilating the bronchi, but all have shown some degree of potential for central stimulation.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future11.gif"></div>

<p>Ephedrine itself is a drug of antiquity, being the active ingredient of plant extracts of <em>Catha Edulis</em><a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>51</sup></a>. In recent years a number of synthetic 
analogs have been introduced into clinical practice with the hopes that the index between decongestion and stimulation would be improved to minimize abuse 
potential. A number of these are currently employed as vasoconstrictors and pressor agents [Neosynephrine (phenylephrine); metaraminol; Propadrine 
(phenylpropanolamine); mephentermine (Wyamine)]. Documentation for the abuse potential within this family is provided by a report of mephentermine-induced 
psychoses<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>52</sup></a> that were clinically identical to examples seen in cases of amphetamine misuse. Hydrogenation of the aromatic ring to produce the totally 
aliphatic analogs, both alicyclic and open chain, of amphetamine and methamphetamine has been a device used to exclude central action while maintaining 
only the desired bronchial and vascular effects of ephedrine. However, there, have been reports of misuse and abuse, leading to druginduced psychotic 
states involving these materials [<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>53</sup></a>]. Dozens of pharmacologically related sympathomimetics are currently being investigated clinically, and there is 
little question that many of them will have the potential for stimulatory abuse.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future12.gif"></div>

<p>Another class of mild central stimulants that are reportedly without tolerance-building capabilities or antidepressant properties are compounds based 
upon the structure of Pipradrol (diphenyl-2-piperadylcarbinol, <strong>19</strong>).</p>

<p>There seems to be a valid generalization that if the piperidine ring is <i>alpha</i>-attached to the benzylic carbon (with or without the benzylic 
hydroxyl group) the compound has sympathomimetic properties. It is, under these circumstances, a substituted ephedrine or amphetamine. Some of the 
clinically explored analogs are highly potent as stimulants. An analog studied by the Schering group (<em>Sch-5472</em>, <strong>20</strong>) is effective in counteracting fatigue 
in humans at submilligram levels<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>54</sup></a>. If the piperidine ring (often as a piperazine ring) is attached through the nitrogen atom, the resulting compounds 
appear to be effective agents in relieving motion sickness (vide cyclizine, Meclizine), although example of this positional isomer are known to be 
stimulants (see <em>Su-19789B</em>, 2-[p-methoxy-<i>alpha</i>-(1-piperidyl)-benzyl]-cyclohexanol<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>55</sup></a>). Reports of abuse of such antihistamine motion-sickness drugs 
have been reported<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>56,57</sup></a> in intentional attempts to produce drug-induced sensory changes. If the attachment is at the gamma-position of the piperidine 
ring, one can find antagonist actions to these stimulants. It is only with this first, the alpha-substituted piperidine group, that structural manipulation 
seems likely to lead to new and more potent drugs.</p>

<p>A recently developed and commercially successful class of psychotropic drugs are the tricyclic antidepressants related to imipramine. This varied group 
of drugs seem to be stimulants in cases of pathologic depression (as in the depressed phase of manic depressives) but appear to have little effect in 
normals. However, their potential for abuse is well established, since they have clearly defined stimulatory action in cases of chronic usage<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>58</sup></a> and have 
been encountered increasingly frequently in post-mortem examinations of accidental deaths due to possible drug overdosages<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>59</sup></a>. This class of drugs is 
currently available only by prescription. They are reasonably sophisticated in their syntheses, and should provide little incentive to the illicit chemist.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future13.gif"></div>

<p>This is not true in the case of another well-known stimulant, cocaine (<strong>21</strong>). There appears to be a recent increase in popularity and usage of the drug, 
although much of that which is claimed to be cocaine is extensively diluted with procaine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>60</sup></a> and methedrine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>61</sup></a>. Classically the drug has been obtained 
from the Coca tree, which is native to South America. However, the growing popularity of the drug and the extremely high price demanded in illicit trade 
have attracted the attention of the underground synthetic chemists, and there is indeed evidence that the drug is currently being synthesized<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>62</sup></a>. It is 
true that cocaine of legitimate commerce is already semisynthetic. The crude coca alkaloids are saponified to the compound ecgonine, which can be easily 
reconstituted to pure cocaine by benzoylation and esterification with methyl alcohol.</p>

<p>The total synthesis of ecgonine (and thus of cocaine) is more tedious. However, the procedures have been in the chemical literature for decades<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>63</sup></a> and 
employ easily available starting materials.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future14.gif"></div>

<p>It seems reasonable to anticipate that as more synthetic attention is directed toward this family of stimulants, more easily prepared analogs will be 
seriously investigated as cocaine substitutes. In the case of cocaine itself, it is known that variations of the carbomethoxy group leads to no dimunition 
of either anaesthetic or stimulant properties, although most substitution changes on the benzoic acid moiety lessen activity. A similar but chemically more 
easily accessable molecule is represented by benzoyl-pseudotropine (<strong>22</strong>), also a component of <em>Erythroxylon coca</em><a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>64</sup></a> and also known to be centrally 
active. Care must be shown in classifying these compounds. The pseudotropeines are esters with configuration shown for <strong>22</strong>. These only are the stimulants 
and anaesthetics. The reversed stereoconfiguration of the eater group (the OCOR on the side of the piperidine ring opposite the N-CHa rather than on the 
same side) leads to the normal tropine series as found in the natural alkaloid atropine and in several clinically valuable synthetic drugs such as 
benztropin. This latter family is largely parasympatholytic rather than sympathomimetic, and its future abuse potential is discussed in the section on 
hallucinogens.</p>

<p>Another, yet simpler, series of potential cocaine substitutes might be found in the open-chain piperidine analogs such as <strong>23</strong>. A number of these 
extremely easily synthesized esters have been employed in imitation of cocaine as contact anaesthetic agents, or in imitation of atropine as mydriatic 
agents, but there is little information at hand concerning their abuse potential using the parenteral routes employed with cocaine.</p>

<div class="stdtxt">
<h2>Depressants</h2>

<p>A third family of abuse drugs, with both a current history of extensive illegal availability and a future potential as a major problem, are the 
depressants. The term depressant is inexact, for the pharmacologic expression of action is strongly dependent upon the dosage of the drug employed and the 
setting in which it is used. The materials to be discussed under this heading are, in small dosages, primarily sedative. This means that in the absence of 
a stimulative or reinforcing environment, there is a diminution of sensory sensitivity with the corollary reduction of activity. In the presence of active 
sensory input, the response to modest dosages is one of intoxication, of physical limitation in responses, and of an intellectual uncertainty in social 
interaction. At higher dosage levels, the sensory depression becomes overwhelming, and a hypnosis or sleep state predominates. This presentation is 
concerned with the potential for the appearance of new drugs in this area of abuse.</p>

<p>The barbiturates represent one of the oldest and best established pharmacologic examples of the sedative-hypnotics or depressants. In the strictest 
sense, the barbiturates are any of some 35 prescribable 5,5-disubstituted derivatives of bartituric acid in accordance with the generalized formula <strong>24</strong>. 
In their variation of structure, the R groups can vary from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>6</sub> alkyl groups, with or without unsaturation, with or without bromo groups, and one can 
be the phenyl group. None of these drugs are highly potent; it is rare to find a prescription calling for less than 50 mg, and with some of the 
longer acting drugs ten times this level is commonly used.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of clinical utility, there need be only a fraction of this number available, but from the drug-abuse potential, there may soon be ten 
times this number. There is clinical need of drug-induced sedation, but it is difficult to see (outside of the proprietary and patent positions of ethical 
houses) why perhaps three barbiturates might not serve all medical needs. One of long duration, perhaps with some anticonvulsant virtues as well, such as 
phenobarbital (<strong>25</strong>) is needed. An intermediate-term agent that is well tolerated should be available; and, lastly, a short-acting agent for preparation for 
anesthesia or as a surgical adjunct. Yet the permutations of the various possible R-groups in <strong>24</strong> yield literally thousands of possible structures, all of 
which certainly have some hypnotic action and, thus abuse potential. Admittedly, the BNDD scheduling has blanketed this structural class; however, one 
wonders if making a material illegal has ever seriously deterred its preparation, assuming there is sufficient financial reward associated with its 
distribution.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future15.gif"></div>

<p>The inventive illegal chemist has several structural modifications available to him. The substitution of one of the N-H groups of <strong>24</strong> with an N-CH<sub>3</sub> increases the potency of the drug some two to three times. An example is Metharbital (<strong>26</strong>), which is used more frequently as an anticonvulsant than as a sedative. If there are two N-methyl substitutions the resulting compounds are convulsants. The classification of either class of compounds as "Barbituric Acid Derivatives" would be extremely difficult to document legally, and it is a real possibility that such homologs would lie outside of the current narcotics laws.</p>

<p>In the last, few years a large number of chemicals have appeared for clinical use which are pharmacologically interchangeable with the barbiturates, 
but which chemically lack one of the nitrogen atoms of the parent heterocyclic ring.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future16.gif"></div>

<p>Properly, these materials are piperidones or piperidiones, and in no conceivable way can they be in the drug class of barbiturates, legally.</p>

<p>Two of the better known examples of such compounds, both in the pharmacologic sense as well as in their appearance on the street, are glutethimide 
(Doriden, sold illegally as "Cibas" due to the inscription on the tablet) (<strong>27</strong>) and methyprylon (<strong>28</strong>). Both of these chemicals have been now incorporated 
into the scheduled lists of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, in immediate company with the barbituric acid derivatives.</p>

<p>There are at least two future problems that can be foreseen in this area. The first is that these materials, having been classified as substances other 
than barbituric acid derivatives (and properly so), establish the precedent that any homologs and analogs of these classes may be considered as being 
outside the blanket description of "barbiturates." There are literally dozens of rather easily synthesized analogs of both <strong>27</strong> and <strong>28</strong> that are 
established pharmacologically as depressants, and that are not controllable as a family (barbiturates) or as specific drugs (only gluthetimide and 
methyprylon are named). A second problem lies fallow in the literature, and it will take only a single devoted and industrious chemist to reveal it to the 
drug subculture. It has been evident for many years that there is a close interrelationship between anticonvulsant and convulsant activity, and between 
sedative and stimulant activity. Within all of these families, it is a consistent observation that if one extends the alkyl chains, or if one adds 
increasing N-alkyl substitution, one tends to generate activity out of inactivity, or to shift from a quieting of the CNS to the stimulation of it. Yet 
another structural rearrangement is known that similarly could be a starting point for a family of abuse drugs. If the <i>alpha,alpha</i> dialkyl groups of 
glutethimide are translocated to the <em>beta</em>-<em>beta</em>-corresponding positions, one can find an entirely new family of drugs, those related to the commercial 
compound Bemegrid (<strong>29</strong>). This latter material is a CNS stimulant, and it is reasonable to expect that many of the possible analogs of this simple compound 
will be pharmacologically equivalent, differing only in the dosage required for effective activity.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future17.gif"></div>

<p>Recently a new class of sedative hypnotics have appeared and enjoyed a rapidly spreading popularity. A representative of this class is the drug 
methaqualone (<b>30</b>), which is sold under a number of trade names (such as Quaalude and Sopor). The potential for abuse and physiologic dependence is 
well documented in Japan, where the drug was introduced many years ago, and where in the latter part of the sixties surveys implicated this sedative in 
the majority of hospitalized drug abuse cases. The drug was introduced about 15 years ago in this country, and apparently the same patterns are evolving. 
Over the last year there has been a broad popularization of this material in the press<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>65-67</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future18.gif"></div>

<p>Although this family of readily synthesized chemicals was originally prepared with antimalarial activity in mind, the first pharmacologic activity observed 
was that of analgesia<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>68</sup></a>. The evaluation of a number of these materials as hypnotics<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>69</sup></a> led to the selection of methaqualone as a preferred clinical 
choice. The widely recognized abuse of this drug led to the proposal to list it as a Schedule II drug<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>70</sup></a>. However, a large number of derivatives both 
with substitution variation in the mono-substituted phenyl ring [<strong>31</strong>, R<sup>1</sup>] and in the fused benzo-ring [<strong>31</strong>, R<sup>2</sup>] have been found to possess varying 
degrees of sedative and hypnotic activity [<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>71</sup></a>]. Currently, several are being clinically explored. [Mecloqualone (<strong>31</strong>), R<sup>1</sup> = Cl, R<sup>2</sup> = H<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>72</sup></a>; Ethinazone, 
R<sup>1</sup> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, R<sup>2</sup> = H<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>73</sup></a>; SL-164, R<sup>1</sup> = 2-CH<sub>3</sub>-4-Cl, R<sup>2</sup> = 5-Cl<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>74</sup></a>]. The simple synthetic procedures that give rise to members of this family, the 
interaction between acetylanthranilic acid and a substituted aniline, promise an almost unlimited variety of future abusable drugs.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future19.gif"></div>

<p>Another new and increasingly abused class of depressants are the benzodiazepines. Two of the most widely used prescriptional alternatives to the 
barbiturates or to meprobamate in anxiety and tension states are chlordiazepoxide [Librium, <b>32</b>] and diazepam [Valium, <strong>33</strong>].</p>

<p>There is no question but that these drugs, along with several related analogs such as flurazepam (Dalmane) and oxazepam (Serax), are abusable, and that 
there are frequently observable cases of performance decrement resulting from their chronic (and legal) usage. There is documented evidence of extremely 
distressful withdrawal symptoms following extended usage<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>75,76</sup></a>. The question regarding these drugs, and for that matter all prescribable psychotropic 
drugs of such nature, is whether their abuse potential and liability is sufficient to warrant imposing the requirements of registration and bookkeeping 
associated with scheduling under the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Such proposals have been made in the instances of Librium and Valium, but 
the issue is not yet resolved. There is, at present, no indication of illegitimate preparation and sale of such drugs; their availability is substantially 
entirely through proper medical channels, and there is little of the social reinforcement that usually accompanies the chronic drug abuse associated with 
the other depressants.</p>

<p>A difficult-to-classify family of drugs are those related to phencyclidine (<strong>34</strong>) as a parent substance. These materials are dissociative anaesthetics in 
their clinical application, but are widely abused due to the consistant visual synthesis experienced as a side reaction of their use. These compounds 
are probably best classified with the extremely fast-acting barbiturate anaesthetics in the pharmacologic sense.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future20.gif"></div>

<p>In recent years there has been an immense increase in the use of phencyclidine and its close relatives. In part this is due to the easy synthesis of such 
compounds from inexpensive, commercially available precursors. The presence of a small level of phencyclidine in conjunction with another drug can serve 
as an extender of activity. These misidentified mixtures are often encountered in the area of the hallucinogens. Frequently, the drug-user has been unaware 
of the addition of such materials.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future21.gif"></div>

<p>Although phencyclidine itself has been placed within Schedule III of the BNDD's listings of controlled substances, the original chemical literature 
describes the synthesis of a large number of closely related compounds<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>77</sup></a> and the associated patent literature gives quantitative data as to their 
potencies in humans<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>78</sup></a>. In the last two years a number of these analogs have appeared on the illicit market, viz. the N-ethyl homolog [<strong>35</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>] 
and the thiophene analog [<strong>35</strong>, Ar = thiophenyl, R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = pentamethylene]. These latter two compounds are similar to phencyclidine in activity, both 
quantitatively and qualitatively, and are not included in any current drug listing. Of course these could be the harbingers of an open-ended number of 
varients, many of which could be predicted to maintain this form of biologic activity.</p>

<h2>Hallucinogens</h2>

<p>The hallucinogens as a family of drugs must stand apart from those previously discussed in this paper. There is generally accepted clinical utility for 
the opiate-like narcotics, for the stimulants, and for the sedative-hypnotics, but there is little agreed-upon medical justification for the hallucinogens. 
There are only anecdotal<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>79</sup></a> organic pathologies that are clinically responsive to them. These materials have been extensively explored as a research tool 
in efforts to unravel some of the biologic parameters associated with abnormal mental states. Thero is no longer any argument against the observation that 
similarities exist between the artificial intoxication induced by these compounds and spontaneous schizophrenia. Several of the hallucinogens have been 
explored as agents in psychotherapy, exploiting the disinhibition of affective restraint and the recovery of suppressed thought-processes that so often 
accompany the intoxication. A number of these materials have been broadly explored as introspective agents of change in the exploration of states of 
consciousness, of creativity enhancement, and in efforts to achieve an improved degree of self-understanding. All of these ends have been achieved by some 
of the agents, but none of these fall within the category of "established medical utility." Some of these materials are used for their relaxation or 
entertainment value, and although such uses are medically tolerated, there are alternate, socially acceptable agents that achieve the same state.</p>

<p>Another problem associated with this family of drugs is one of nomenclature. The term "hallucinogens" has been used here in the title, as it is probably 
the name most frequently associated with these compounds in the popular press and in the statutes. This is a misnomer, however, as many of these materials 
are not known to give rise to any such phenomenon. In the large majority of the extensive scientific and literary writings concerned with subjective 
descriptions of the effects produced by many of these drugs, the term "hallucination" is not used. An artificial word "psychotomimetic," literally 
psychosis-generating, is frequently employed. The above-mentioned capability of mimicking some of the clinical aspects of disturbed mental states generated 
this term; however it is far too encompassing, and is generally restricted to medical research studies. The term "psychedelic" is often used and is closely 
associated with the intellectual and socially oriented properties mentioned above. It is rarely, if ever, found in the scientific literature, as there is 
an accompanying connotation of approval and sanction. The term psychodysleptic is found in European publications, but it, too, is artificial.</p>

<p>Further differences between this family of drugs and the previously mentioned families is the notoriety that seems to be a direct consequence of some of 
the above points. There is a highly vocal minority who advocate drug use as a harmless contribution to their life style and who feel they have been 
unjustifiably maligned by those who do not share their opinions. On the other hand, there is an equally unreasonable reaction by a minority who condemn 
this area of pharmacology without qualification. As a result of this continuing conflict, there is an unjustified newsworthiness in the area of the 
hallucinogenic drugs, and a consequent tendency to exaggerate the problems of abuse.</p>

<p>In this paper these materials will be organized into groups reflecting their potential for abuse in the future, those which are, in fact, unknown and 
probably will remain so, those contributing to the present problem but which have little promise for creating new dimensions of difficulties, and those 
representing the more likely candidates for future contributions to the drug problem.</p>

<p>Many scientifically documented hallucinogens are actually unknown in illicit usage, since they are unavailable, due either to botanical rarity or to 
synthetic complexity. As a consequence there is a high level of misrepresentation that is largely undetected, as there are very few avenues that can be 
used to correctly document the identity of an alleged hallucinogenic drug. Many of these are complex organic molecules, usually alkaloids, which are 
widely discussed among the drug cognoscenti but which are, in fact, so rare as to constitute a negligible problem. Examples are the alkaloids psilocybin 
and psilocin from the Mexican mushroom Teonanacatl (<em>Psilocybe mexicana</em>), as well as the dissimilar alkaloids from the Amanita muscaria, muscimol and 
ibotenic acid. These materials are unknown in the illicit drug trade.</p>

<p>Another family of chemicals that has received wide publicity and consequently wide popularity are the synthetic chemicals related to the alleged active 
ingredients of marijuana, the tetrahydrocannabinols (THC). Because of the recent wide distribution and usage of marijuana, the announcement of the 
successful syntheses of the THCs prompted a wide interest in these chemicals. They are indeed synthesizable but only as laboratory curiosities, or in 
the larger amounts contracted for by the government at enormous expense. They have never been available as bona fide chemicals in the illegal drug market. 
Nonetheless they have been incorporated, in all possible isomer forms, into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances listing. These materials will slowly 
make their way into clinical studies, but their appearance as a future drug abuse problem is unlikely due to the economics inherent in their production. 
Some of the recently available "synthetic THC" actually has been enriched isolates from marijuana itself. Such material is of botanic origin, not synthetic, 
and merely represents a different form of marijuana.</p>

<p>A number of relatively rare plant alkaloids periodically are reputed to be available on the street, but in general, the synthetic unavailability of these 
should limit them to the position of future trivial novelties. lbogaine, although now also listed as a Schedule I drug, is a rare isolate from the African 
plant <em>Tabernanthe iboga</em>. Similarly, yohimbine, mitragynine, mesembrine, and many other obscure alkaloids are often believed to be available on the illicit 
drug market, yet their rarity and uncertainty of action allow them to be ignored as future problems.</p>

<p>A second classification of the hallucinogenics is that which included drugs that contribute to the present problem, but which seem to lack the structural 
devices that would allow modification and manipulation into new and unknown directions. Axiomatically, such materials are primarily of botanic origin, 
and at best are only subject to minor physical or chemical manipulation to produce end-products.</p>

<p>Foremost among these is marijuana. Whatever the current extent of the drug problem associated with the use of marijuana, it is unlikely that any new 
extensions will emerge as a complication. The synthetic availability of the components has been discussed above under THC. The processing of extracts 
represent repackaging, not a new drug problem. Synthetic novelties that might be considered outgrowths of the known chemistry of marijuana would seem to 
be uneconomical.</p>

<p>In many ways the same conclusion may be drawn concerning lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD. LSD is one of the most complex drugs known, both structurally 
and pharmacologically. This material is not found in nature, but must be manufactured from any of the naturally available ergot alkaloids such as 
ergotamine or ergonovine. Although it has been continuously manufactured and marketed for the last 15 years in this country, it is interesting that there 
have been little if any variations attempted with its chemical structure. In the scientific literature it is known that methylation or acetylation of the 
indolic nitrogen atom leads to drugs of the same high potency<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>80,81</sup></a>, yet such chemicals, which would be outside the letter of the law as it presently 
stands, have never appeared in the illicit market. In attempting to evaluate the future problems to be encountered in areas related to LSD usage, it must 
be remembered that any structural variation, any chemical device to modify the parent structure of LSD, will have as its goal the attempt to side-step the 
law, not to appeal to any new pharmacologic need. All such products would depend upon the same natural sources for the lysergic acid portion of the molecule, 
and if this hurdle is overcome, it is reasonable to expect that the ubiquitously known and accepted product LSD itself might as well be prepared.</p>

<p>A limited flurry of interest in an entirely separate source of the ergot alkaloids, to be used as hallucinogenics themselves rather than to serve as 
precursor to LSD, has recently been directed toward the seeds of several Convolvulaceae. These morning glory seeds show an activity similar to that found 
in LSD and are clearly related to the native intoxicant of Mexico, Ololuiqui<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>82</sup></a>. However, these alkaloids cannot be converted into LSD in a practical 
manner, and should pose no future problem.</p>

<p>Those hallucinogenic drugs that are the most likely candidates for modification resulting in future drugs with abuse potential are those that are totally 
synthetic, or, if from plant sources, have a sufficiently simple structure that analogs may be totally synthesized. The production of these materials would 
not depend upon plant sources. Three groups meet these requirements, the indoles related to the tryptamines and carbolines, the phenethylamines, and the 
choline analogs related to atropine. Interestingly, each of these families has a distinct qualitative aura associated with it, one which might well be 
expected to be maintained throughout chemical modification, and which-night well dictate the direction of research enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Although the indoles are based orignially on plant sources, such as snuffs of the Caribbean area or intoxicants of South America, they are relatively 
easily available through synthesis. As such they may serve as representative paradigms of hallucinogenic exploration. The two parent structures may be 
considered N,N-dimethyltryptamine [DMT (<strong>36</strong>), R = H and Harmaline [<strong>37</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = H, R<sup>2</sup> = OCH<sub>3</sub>]. These chemicals are alkaloids isolated from medicinal plants, 
but both have been extensively modified chemically.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/future22.gif"></div>

<p>It is known that as the alkyl groups on the nitrogen of <strong>36</strong> are extended in length, the activity is decreased (N,N-diethyl<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>83</sup></a>) and finally lost 
(N,N-dibutyl<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>84</sup></a>). All these chemicals have been explored parenterally, since the simplest members are known not to be active orally. However, some of 
the more sterically blocked analogs have the reputation of being active orally (for example, the N,N-dipropyl, the N,N-diisopropyl, and the N-<em>tert</em>-butyl), 
and the <em>alpha</em>-methyl<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>92</sup></a> analogs of 5-methoxytryptamines are unexplored, but represent areas of future research studies and consequently, possible future 
drug abuse.</p>

<p>A closely related family of chemicals are the carbolines related to <strong>37</strong>. These materials are principally of plant origins and are synthetically available, 
but unlike the bulk of the tryptamines, they are orally active. Harmaline is the principle alkaloid of the <em>Banisteriopsis</em> genus, but a number of closely 
related chemicals are congeners and are also hallucinogenic. The cyclization of derivatives of 5-methoxytryptamine leads to the 6-methoxyl dihydroharman 
group [<strong>37</strong>, R<sup>1</sup> = OCH<sub>3</sub>, R<sup>2</sup> = H], which are not found in nature, but which are more potent than the natural 7-methoxyl counterparts<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>85</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Most of the dehydro and dihydro analogs of these two large families are now commercially available (<em>Regis Chemical Company</em>), but as yet little clinical 
data have been reported. None of these chemicals is as active as 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, for example, but they are orally active, and they 
represent chemical classes that are relatively unexplored.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future23.gif"></div>

<p>The second class of hallucinogenic substances that might well serve as a starting pont for future study and thus for future abuse is the phenethylamine 
class. The parent compound is mescaline (<strong>38</strong>). It has been observed that if the alkyl chain is extended to a length of three carbons as shown in <strong>39</strong>, then 
reorientation of the methoxyl substitutions<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>86</sup></a> and appropriate changes in the substitution patterns<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>87</sup></a> can markedly amplify the potency of resulting 
hallucinogen.</p>

<p>Such variation has resulted in extensive changes in both quality and potency of the resulting drug. Substitution in the apparently sensitive para-position 
of a methyl group [as in 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine; <strong>39</strong>, R = 2,5-(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-4-CH<sub>3</sub>] has led to the street-abused compound STP (DOM), and a 
bromine atom in this position [<strong>39</strong>, R = 4-Br-2,5-(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>88</sup></a> yields the most potent member yet studied in the phenethylamine series. However, all of 
these variables, position and substituent, are still largely unexplored, and there is no reason not to expect extremely potent or extremely specific 
pharmacologic agents to evolve from studies in these areas in the future.</p>

<p>A third class of compounds is related to atropine (<strong>40</strong>). This group is largely synthetic and is represented by a large number of analogs of high potency. 
All three of these classes of hallucinogenics are distinct not only in their chemical nature but in their pharmacologic action as well. The indoles (DMT, 
Harmaline, LSD) are characterized by the generation of distortions and illusions that appear to arise from within the subject. These are changes of an 
intuitive and interpretive nature. The phenethylamine compounds (mescaline and analogs) lead to sensory changes, perceptual syntheses, or hallucinations 
involving the external world. The atropine analogs under discussion here are quite different in that they generally lead to visual and auditory phenomena 
that are artificial in their sources, and the illusions and hallucinations experienced are frequently beclouded by amnesia. These are disruptive and 
confusing agents, and have been investigated mainly with this reversible disability as a goal.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/future24.gif"></div>

<p>The essential feature of the structure of atropine that separates it from the cocaine-like stimulants is the absolute configuration of the 4-carbon of the 
piperidine ring. In <strong>40</strong>, the oxygen that is attached to this carbon is directed downward, trans to the basic nitrogen; in cocaine (<strong>21</strong>) this oxygen is 
directed upward, <em>cis</em> to the nitrogen. Most of the synthetic drugs covered in this subsection have the piperidine ring opened, and this structural subtlety 
is lost. These compounds may be represented by the general formula <strong>41</strong>. A number of these compounds have received sufficiently widespread use that they 
have been included in the controlled drug schedules as hallucinogens. These are JB-318 and JB-336 [<strong>41</strong>, with R<sup>1</sup> = OH, R<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>3</sup> = phenyl, and R<sup>4</sup> = 
N-ethyl-3-piperidyl and N-methyl-3-piperidyl, respectively]. Hundreds of additional compounds have been reported in the chemical literature that are 
of similar activity in man. The structural generalizations<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>91</sup></a> that lead to this activity require a hydroxyl or a halide at R<sup>1</sup>; R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> may be varied, 
but usually are either phenyl or cycloalkyl; and R<sup>4</sup> is almost any grouping, requiring only that a basic nitrogen be two carbons removed from the ester 
function. Benzilic acid, as well as a number of cycloalkylphenylglycolic acids, are commercially available, as are several ethanolamines such as 
N-methylpiperidinol and quinuclidinol. With easy access to the two halves of these biologically active esters, it seems likely that an increasing number 
of them will appear in the future as abused drugs.</p>

<h2>Prescription and Over-The-Counter Drugs</h2>

<p>In the search for possible future drug abuse problems, it is customary to assume that these shall be developments and extensions of present-day problems. 
There is much evidence that quite a different style of evolution might be encountered. A large number of the drugs that constitute today's problems have 
extensive histories of accepted medical utility.</p>

<p>In the area of prescriptional availability many of the narcotic analgesics, appetite suppressants, sedative hypnotics, and antidepressants currently 
abused once were, or still are, readily obtained from completely legal sources. It is axiomatic that any drug that has pharmacologic action can be abused 
if used to excess. Of course, the large majority of prescriptional drugs are not being abused, but all have such potential, and more and more of them will 
receive this reputation. Opening the PDR (<i>Physicians' Desk Reference to Pharmaceutical Specialties and Biologicals is an annual volume published 
by Medical Economics, Inc. which lists the composition utility, dosage information, and precautions associated with thousands of prescription drugs.</i>)  
at random and looking to the "Contraindications, Precautions, and Adverse Reactions" section of a drug's description, one encounters frequent mention of 
side effects such as dizziness, confusion, loss of orientation, drowsiness, or signs of overstimulation. These untoward symptoms are, of course, rarely 
encountered and are undesirable in the proper clinical utilization of any drug in question but still they should serve as clues to the misuse potential 
of a drug through excessive use. Nonetheless, to a large measure, these materials are prescribed for their primary alleged property, and it must be 
that many of these chemicals are designed to change the mental attitude of the patient. Thus, a host of psychoactive materials are made available to the 
practicing physician, and he is their initial distributor.</p>

<p>A second source of legal drugs that has the proven potential of introducing abuse substances into the general population is the overthe-counter market. 
There are literally tens of thousands of drugs and drug combinations available without prescription. Most of these are innocuous, having little 
pharmacologic activity of any sort, either virtuous or potentially abusable. Many of these, however, contain highly active components in very small 
amounts. There is a continuous exploration of this fertile area by the drug-oriented experimentalist who will try everything from A to Z in the OTC 
market place. The extraordinary tools available to this minority are the willingness to employ intentional overdose levels and the casual use of 
parenteral routes with drugs intended exclusively for oral consumption. Past examples abound of this transition from "harmless" to "abuse" status. 
A single illustration may be presented in the case of the substance dextromethorphan, an effective antitussive mentioned earlier in the section on 
opiates. This drug was widely available in tablet form under the trade name of Romilar some 15 years ago. Although the nominal dosage needed for effective 
cough suppression is 10 to 20 mg, it was found that 10 to 20 times this dosage produced a severe state of intoxication that resembled several of the 
atropine-like parasympathomimetics. There was an abrupt upswing of sales and abuse, and the chemical was withdrawn from the OTC market. Recently however, 
it has reappeared under a host of new names but only in a mixture with such quantities of excipient syrups that intentional overdosages would require 
Herculean devotion. Nonetheless, there was a recent broadcast mailing to "Householder" of free trial samples of "Vicks44" diluted with some appealing 
flavoring, and it is possible that this cycle may yet be repeated.</p>

<p>A future complication, which is difficult to predict, is associated with the problem of polypharmacy. This phenomenon is related to the combined effects 
of two or more drugs upon the body when administered at the same time. As more prescription drugs become available, and as frequent usage of a given drug 
tends to lull the user into forgetting its classification as a drug, there is the increased probability of observing potentiation or synergism resulting 
from multiple drug use. Some of these interactions are well recognized in the medical literature (such as the mutual potentiation of the toxic effects of 
alcohol and any of the barbiturates), but such potential problems are rarely appreciated by the drug user. As new and less well known drugs emerge into 
popular usage, the possibilities of such unpredictable interactions will increase dramatically.</p>

<p>There has always been, and probably will continue to be, an ethnopharmacologically oriented fringe who will eat or smoke any botanical product that is at 
hand. From such inquiry, there will be a continuous trickle of word-of-mouth detail concerning some "legal high" to be found in some mushroom or leaf. 
These events will be the newsworthy feature of the moment, and will probably elicit stern warning from the administrative authorities, but will almost 
certainly not contribute a whit to our future drug abuse problems.</p>

<h2>Classification of Controlled Substances</h2>

<p>A number of the drugs that have been discussed in this paper are listed in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Schedules of Controlled Substances. 
This listing is authorized by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Public Law 91513. This act is organized so that all 
applicable drugs are classified in schedules that reflect their medical utility and abuse potential. Thus Schedule I drugs are those that are felt to be 
without clinical utility and with high abuse potential, and Schedule V those drugs requiring the least control and scrutiny. There is a continuing problem 
inherent in any effort to legislate the classifications of drugs. The specific members that are felt to be culpable can be named, and by this very 
specificity, those that may be closely related pharmacologically but that are in fact different compounds are not covered. Conversely, classifications may 
be made by broad generalities, but sweeping classes, either chemical or pharmacologic, will invariably embrace analogs that are not intended to be 
included, and have historically died on the argument of making exact the term "similar." The former procedure, which has been adopted in P.L. 91-513, 
suffers from having to be continuously revised and extended to name currently recognized problems. The latter is classically deficient in that there is a 
blanket condemnation of unending classes of materials, and one is always arguing the cause of exceptions.</p>

<p>The substances currently recognized in the Schedules of Controlled Substances are listed below, organized in accordance with the presentations of this 
paper rather than by schedule. Note is made of the listed schedule and the bureau controlled substances code number assigned to it [e.g., <em>clonitazene; 
(I), (9612)</em>], Some of the apparent conflicts and contradictions will be explained as far as possible in appropriate footnotes, indicated by lower case 
roman numerals. The named drugs are from the most recent publication available<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a> and probably represent the correct status of scheduled drugs to the 
end of 1972 (<strong>i</strong>). 
A number of apparent superficial contradictions have been resolved through direct correspondence with the BNDD (Formerly, now DEA), and appropriate comment 
will be made. Where there are no entries in the schedules for a given text classification, this will be noted. Recent addition or reclassifications are 
also noted. Those drugs that are listed only because they are isomers of, derivatives of, or precursors to, named drugs are itemized in the appropriate 
footnotes.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p>(<strong>i</strong>) The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 required that the schedules of controlled substances established within the Act be updated and republished on a semiannual basis. This present compilation is dated May 8, 1972<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a> but apparently is unchanged at the end of 1972.</p>
<p>(<strong>ii</strong>) The isoquinoline alkaloids found as natural components of opium have been specifically excluded from these schedules.</p>
<p>(<strong>iii</strong>) These six code numbers refer to various forms and styles of opium extracts (powders, tincture, etc.) as well as to the parent drug itself. When  the amount of opium present is less than 0.5% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as III (9809). When the amount is less than 0.1% it is  scheduled a V and has no assigned code number.</p>
<p>(<strong>iv</strong>) Those drugs that are chemically derived from morphine are grouped below under "morphine conversion products." When the amount of morphine present is less than 0.05% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as III (9810).</p>
<p>(<strong>v</strong>) Those drugs that are chemically derived from codeine are grouped below under "codeine conversion products." When the amount of codeine present is less than 1.8% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as III (9804). If the pharmaceutical contains in addition to the 1.8% codeine at least as much isoquinoline alkaloid from opium, the schedule is III but the code number is 9803. If the amount of codeine present is less than 0.2% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as V and teas no assigned code number.</p>
<p>(<strong>vi</strong>) Thebaine is actually a convulsant rather than a narcotic. It is nonetheless listed as a scheduled drug primarily for the fact that it is indeed an alkaloid isolated from opium, and it is also a principle chemical precursor to the several oripavine derivatives to be listed below.</p>
<p>(<strong>vii</strong>) The classification of morphine conversion products (or codeine conversion products listed below) is based on structural appearance rather than procedures of preparation or pharmacologic action. Thus compounds with a free phenolic hydroxy group, or esters or ethers thereof, are related to morphine, and compounds that are methylated at that position are considered as being related to codeine.</p>
<p>(<strong>viii</strong>) Hydromorphine (Dilaudid) is classified as an opium derivative in Schedule II although there is no indication that it occurs in nature. It is chemically derived from morphine.</p>
<p>(<strong>ix</strong>) This entry is an ambiguous entry in the BNDD schedules. The terms "hydromorphinol" and "oxymorphone" are synonymous, and thus it is strange that they should be entered under different schedules. Yet more distressful is that each schedule specifically excludes any compound "that is listed in another schedule." It is possible that, by technicality, this drug is not a scheduled drug at all.</p>
<p>(<strong>x</strong>) The term morphine methylsulfonate is inherently ambiguous, in that it can refer either to a salt of morphine with methylsulfuric acid, or a quarternary homolog of morphine formed by interaction of morphine with methyl sulfate. Dr. Anderson<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>90</sup></a> has stated that the latter interpretation is the intended one.</p>
<p>(<strong>xi</strong>) This drug has been included in the opiate component of the scheduled drug lists, although it is a clear-cut chemical derivative of morphine. When the amount of ethylmorphine is less than 0.3% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as III (9808). In amounts of 0.1% it is considered as schedule V and has not been assigned a code number. It is of historical note that this drug was controlled in the first drafts of these laws in these lower concentrations only, and was technically unrecognized at higher concentrations in the intact opium exuate). It has recently become a legal component of the plant, and is listed in pure form as an opium component.</p>
<p>(<strong>xii</strong>) Apomorphine is listed as if it is a component of the raw material opium, brut in fact it is a chemical conversion product of morphine. It is  emetic in action, and apparently has no analgesic or abuse potentials. Its inclusion in this schedule seems pharmacologically capricious. (See lysergic  acid, below, in the depressant category.)</p>
<p>(<strong>xiii</strong>) When the amount of dihydrocodeine is less than 1.8% of the pharmaceutical in question, it is scheduled as III (9807). In amounts of 0.1% it is considered as a schedule V drug and has not been assigned a code number.</p>
<p>(<strong>xiv</strong>) Dihydrocodeinone is synonymous with hydrocodone. At 0.3% in a given pharmaceutical preparation, it is scheduled as III (9806). If there is at least a fourfold presence of isoquinoline alkaloids from the parent opium source present, it is again scheduled III but with a code number of 9805. it is not a natural component of opium as implied by its schedule II listing.</p>
<p>(<strong>xv</strong>) Racemorphan is the racemate compound of this family, containing equal weights of the (-) isomer levorphanol (schedule II) and the (+) isomer dextrophan (schedule I). There is no immediate explanation why racemorphan, containing 50% by weight of a schedule I drug should be classified schedule II. Vide the methorphan family below.</p>
<p>(<strong>xvi</strong>) Racemethorphan is the methyl ether of racemorphan discussed in (<strong>xv</strong>) above. Here again the (-) isomer is maintained in schedule II (<strong>vi</strong>) but the (+) isomer has been released from control (specifically authorized in P.L. 91-513, p. 12 (g.2).</p>
<p>(<strong>xvii</strong>) When the amount of diphenoxylate is less than 0.0025% of the pharmaceutical in question (one must assume that the "100 g of pharmaceutical content" was intended, although it is missing from the letter of the law) and if there is some 1% of atropine also present (percentage of diphenoxylate) then this chemical is classified as a schedule V drug and has no code number.</p>
<p>(<strong>xviii</strong>) A synonym for pethidine is meperidine. Not only is it scheduled in group (II) but three of the possible chemical intermediates are as well. 4-Cyano-1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine (the cyanoprecursor to the final ester, (II) (9232)), the 4-normethylcarbethoxy compound, ethyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxylate (II) (9233), and the free acid of pethidine (1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid, (II) (9234)) are also  controlled substances.</p>
<p>(<strong>xix</strong>) Both <em>alpha</em>-meprodine and <em>beta</em>-meprodine are unlisted in most American texts on narcotic substances. It is listed in the International Control Treaties as <em>alpha</em> (and <em>beta</em>)-3-ethyl-1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine. It is thus the homolog of prodine with an ethyl group in place of the piperidine methyl group.</p>
<p>(<strong>xx</strong>) A synthetic intermediate that can lead to methadone has also been named and scheduled as a (II) substance. This is 4-cyano-2-dimethylamine-4,4-diphenylbutane, (II) (9254).</p>
<p>(<strong>xxi</strong>) This material is a mixture of the two possible hydroxy analogs of methadol. One is called <em>alpha</em>-methadol (I) (9605) and the other <em>beta</em>-methadol (I) (9609). Not only are the separate components of this mixture specifically scheduled, but the acetyl derivatives of each are as well. See (<strong>xxii</strong>).</p>
<p>(<strong>xxii</strong>) Acetylmethadol is the name given to the mixture of acetyl esters of the substance methadol. Both the <em>alpha</em>-acetyl compound <em>alpha</em>-acetylmethadol, (I) (9603) and the <em>beta</em> counterpart <em>beta</em>-acetylmethadol, (I) (9607) are known as discrete compounds, and they are both specified in the BNDD schedules.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxiii</strong>) The racemic racemorimide is known in each of the two possible optical isomers. Both dextromoramide (I) (9613) and levomoramide (I) (9629) are also scheduled as drugs without medical utility. An intermediate to this family is 4-cyano-2-dimethylamine-4,4-diphenylbutane. This compound is scheduled (II) (9254).</p>
<p>(<strong>xxiv</strong>) Benzitramide is not listed in either American or European reference text. It apparently has the chemical structure: 1-(3-cyano-3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-(2-oxo-3-propionyl-1-benzimidazolinyl)-piperidine<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>90</sup></a> and can be found in the multilingual list of Narcotic Drugs under International Control, United Nations Publication Sales No. E/F/S/R. 69 XI. 1.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxv</strong>) In the American literature, this compound is more frequently referred to as pirinitramide. Chemically it is 1-(3-cyano-3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-(1-piperidino)-piperindine-4-carboxylic acid amide.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxvi</strong>) Amphetamine was a schedule III drug in the initial Public Law 91-513. It was reassigned to schedule II in July, 1971.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxvii</strong>) Methamphetamine was a schedule III drug in the initial Public Law 91-513. It was reassigned to schedule II in July, 1971. It was initially listed specifically as a schedule II drug if in an injectable form, but this distinction is now ignored with the rescheduling of the chemical itself.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxviii</strong>) Both phenmetrazine (Preludin) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) were rescheduled from III to II in November, 1971.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxix</strong>) Ecgonine is listed as a stimulant, although its main role in drug abuse is that of a synthetic precursor of cocaine. See the comments concerning lysergic acid in the section on sedatives.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxx</strong>) Coca leaves are exempted from this listing if they have been decocainized. Further, the extracts of coca leaves are also exempt if they do not contain cocaine or ecgonine.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxi</strong>) Although phenobarbital is property a schedule IV drug, 232 of the 305 specifically named exempt prescription drugs<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a> contain phenobarbital in amounts of up to a half grain. The remaining exempt barbiturate preparations include amobarbital (<strong>11</strong>), butabarbital (<strong>29</strong>), pentobarbital (<strong>14</strong>) and two examples of secobarbital. These represent the most frequently abused barbiturates. Also noted are preparations that contain diallylbarbital, mephobarbital, barbital, and cyclopentylallylbarbituric acid. There are 13 phenobarbital drug combinations specifically named that are completely devoid of either scheduling or a prescription control<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxii</strong>) This is an unrecognized name for the drug mephobarbital<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>90</sup></a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxiii</strong>) This is the only infinite, open-ended chemical classification in the schedules of the controlled drugs. It embraces all of the drugs mentioned in footnote <strong>xxxi</strong>, approximately 30 additional derivatives occasionally found in medical practice, and literally hundreds of literature compounds that have been shown to be pharmacologically related. Obviously an infinity of largely unknown compounds are also automatically included. It is unlikely that the highly potent thiobarbituric acid derivatives are included, however.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxiv</strong>) The listing of lysergic acid and lysergic acid amide as depressants is pharmacologically improper. The sole reason for their inclusion is that they can serve as precursors in the synthesis of lysergic acid diethylamide. As precursors, they may legally be placed in the same schedule as (or higher schedule than) the drug that can be prepared from them. However, lysergic acid diethylamide is in schedule I and these two chemicals are in schedule III.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxv</strong>) In the Federal Register<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a> are listed six prescriptional drug combinations that contain meprobamate in amounts up to 400 mg which are exempt from the scheduling restrictions.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxvi</strong>) Sulfondiethylmethane is an otherwise unrecognized trivial name of the diethylhomolog of sulfonmethane<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>90</sup></a>. The correct chemical name is 3,3-<em>bis</em>(ethylsulfonyl)pentane. There does not appear to be any trivial name.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxvii</strong>) In the introductory paragraph to the Schedule I section concerning Hallucinogens, the wording of the original bill (Public Law 91-513) has been amplified in the most recent reprint<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a> . In this section (and only in this section) the term "isomer" has been extended to include optical, positional, and geometric isomers. It seems reasonable that the term "optical" was suggested to cover those drugs that are racemic but could be resolved or those drugs that are naturally found in only one optical form, but that could be converted to tire corresponding enantiomorph; that the term "positional" refers to the substitution patterns found in the variously substituted amphetamines and benzilates; and the term "geometric" refers to the possible diastereoisomers to be found in the tetrahydrocannabinols. </p> 
<p>(<strong>xxxviii</strong>) In most earlier legislation, the isomer "d" or "+" is specified. Its absence here, together with the comments in footnote <strong>xxxvii</strong>, indicate that the unnatural "l" form and the frequently found decomposition product, the inactive d-isolysergic acid, are also included in this entry.</p>
<p>(<strong>xxxix</strong>) This is the common name for the plant Cannabis sativa. Most earlier legislation exempted the plant materials if they were devoid of pharmacologic activity, as is done in the present law for coca leaves, see footnote <strong>xxx</strong>. The plant has nondrug commercial value (hemp, hemp oil).</p>
<p>(<strong>xl</strong>) In the Federal Register<a href="shulgin.futuredrugs.html#refs"><sup>89</sup></a>, all possible isomers (optical and geometric) for each of the synthetically available double bond positions (10 isomers in all) are specifically named.</p>
<p>(<strong>xli</strong>) There is one additional positional isomer of this compound possible; it is presumably included in this entry.</p>
<p>(<strong>xlii</strong>) There are five additional positional isomers of this compound possible (total of six isomers); they are presumably included in this entry.</p>
<p>(<strong>xliii</strong>) There are 15 additional positional isomers of this compound possible (total of 16 isomers); they are presumably included in this entry.</p>
<p>(<strong>xliv</strong>) This is the common name for the plant Lophophora williamsii. Mescaline (I) (7381) is the presumed active component.</p>
<p>(<strong>xlv</strong>) There are two positional isomers of this compound possible (total of three isomers); they are presumably included in this entry.</p>
