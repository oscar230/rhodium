        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>To isolate alkaloids from plants, the dried and powdered plant material 
          is extracted with pet ether (or hexane, colemans etc.) first. This removes 
          fats, oils, terpenes, waxes etc. This extract is discarded.</p>
        <p>The material is now subjected to an alcohol extraction, eg with methanol 
          or ethanol. The extract is evaporated to leave the crude alkaloids mixture.</p>
        <p>This extract is partitioned between an diluted aq. tartaric acid solution 
          and ethyl acetate. Other acids like citric acid can be used, and other 
          solvents may substitute here. The ethyl acetate layer contains neutral 
          and weakly basic alkaloids. Evaporate the solvent to isolate them.</p>
        <p>The aq. layer is neutralised with NH3 or Na2CO3 and again extracted 
          with ethyl acetate. The organic layer now contains basic alkaloids, 
          while the aq. layer contains quarternary ammonium ions.</p>
        <p>Many alkaloids can be isolated directly from the alkoholic extract 
          by chromatographic methods. This is a separation which works well for 
          tropane alkaloids (atropine, cocaine, scopolamine).</p>
        <p>The alcohol extract is fractionated by column chromatography on SiO2, 
          solvent chloroform followed by chloroform with rising methanol content. 
          This separates lipids and terpenes from the crude alkaloid fraction. 
          The alkaloid fraction is again chromatographed (SiO2; CHCl3 : MeOH = 
          10:1) to isolate the pure alkaloids.</p>
