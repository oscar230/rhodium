<h3>Abstract</h3>
                             
A method of isomerization of alkenyl-alkoxybenzenes which comprises contacting an alkenyl-alkoxybenzene of the formula: 

<p>Wherein m is an integer of 1 to 5, R is lower alkyl or, when m is two or more and at least two of R are adjacent, the adjacent two R may represent lower 
alkylene including methylene and R' is an alkenyl group having a double bond at the position not conjugated with the benzene ring with a catalyst to give 
the corresponding alkenyl-alkoxybenzene wherein the double bond in the alkenyl group represented by R' is migrated to the position conjugated with the 
benzene ring, the said catalyst being the one prepared by heating an alkali metal, an alkali metal hydroxide and alumina at a temperature higher than the 
melting point of the alkali metal. 

<p>The present invention relates to isomerization of alkenyl-alkoxybenzenes. More particularly, it relates to a process for migration of a double bond in 
the alkenyl group of alkenyl-alkoxybenzenes from a position not conjugated with the benzene ring to a position conjugated with the benzene ring by the use 
of a novel catalyst. 

<p>The alkenyl-alkoxybenzenes as hereinabove mentioned are represented by the formula: 

<p>Wherein m is an integer of 1 to 5, R is lower alkyl or, when m is two or more and at least two of R are adjacent, the adjacent two R may represent lower 
alkylene including methylene and R' is an alkenyl group having a double bond at the position not conjugated with the benzene ring. 

<p>For isomerization of the alkenyl-alkoxybenzenes of the said type, various acidic and basic catalyst compositions have been proposed. However, those 
known catalyst compositions are disadvantageous in requiring a relatively high temperature, an expensive solvent, a troublesome purification and so on. 

<p>It has now been found that the alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) is readily isomerized to the correspnding alkenyl-alkoxybenzene wherein the double bond in the 
alkenyl group is migrated to a position conjugated with the benzene ring in a nearly quantitative yield and with a high purity, when contacted with a 
specific, novel catalyst. 

<p>The said catalyst useful in the isomerization of the alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) can be prepared by heating an alkali metal, an alkali metal hydroxide and 
alumina at a temperature higher than the melting point of the alkali metal. 

<p>As the alkali metal, there may be used one or more of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and other metals in Group I of the periodic table. These 
metals may be used in the form of an alloy consisting of two or more kinds of alkali metals. A typical example of such an alloy is sodium potassium alloy. 
Examples of the alkali metal hydroxide are hydroxides of lithium, sodium potassium, rubidium and other metals in Group I of the periodic table. One or more 
kinds thereof can be used. The alkali metal hydroxide is not necessarily required to correspond to the said alkali metal. Thus, the combination of the 
alkali metal and the alkali metal hydroxide to be employed may be, for instance, lithium and lithium hydroxide, sodium and sodium hydroxide, potassium and 
potassium hydroxide or rubidium and rubidium hydroxide as well as lithium and sodium hydroxide, sodium and potassium hydroxide or lithium and potassium 
hydroxide. 

<p>The alumina may be, for instance, .alpha.-alumina, .kappa.-alumina, theta-alumina, delta.-alumina, .gamma.-alumina, .eta.-alumina, chi-alumina or 
.rho.-alumina. There may be also used such an alumina-containing material as kaolin or alumina silicate for the source of alumina. usually, however, 
the use of alumina itself is much favorable. 

<p>The amount of the alkali metal hydroxide with respect to the alumina is not limitative but is
normally preferred to be 1/100 to 100 % by weight. The alkali metal may be employed in an
equimolar or less amount, preferably in an equimolar to 1/100 molar amount, with respect to the
alkali metal hydroxide. 

<p>For preparation of the catalyst, the said materials, i.e. the alkali metal, the alkali metal hydroxide
and the alumina, are heated at a temperature higher than the melting point of the alkali metal (preferably
from 200 to 500 deg. C), ordinarily in an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon while stirring.
The reaction time is associated with the temperature of heating and may be usually from 1 to 30
hours. At a high temperature, the reaction time becomes necessarily short. 

<p>Practically, the alumina is first heated to a desired temperature and, while maintaining such
temperature, the alkali metal hydroxide and the alkali metal are added thereto. Although the order of
incorporation of these materials is optional, the order of the alumina, the alkali metal hydroxide and
the alkali metal is the most preferred. In this case, the alkali metal hydroxide may be used in the
form of an aqueous solution, provided that the water in such solution is sufficiently removed, usually
under reduced pressure, prior to the addition of the alkali metal. 

<p>In the above procedure, the preparation of the catalyst may be started with the use of the alkali metal
and an alumina having water removable therefrom, i.e. without using the alkali metal hydroxide. The
term "removable water" hereinabove used is intended to mean not only movable water itself but also
structural water and hydroxyl groups which can be eliminated in the form of water, inclusively.
Thus, the alumina herein utilizable may be any alumina other than .alpha.-alumina which is
considered to include no removable water. The water content in such utilizable alumina may be
usually from 1.3 to 15 % by weight, favorably from 2.3 to 10 % by weight. The alkali metal is
employed in an amount larger than that which can consume completely the water in the starting
alumina, preferably 1.01 to 2 times the amount which can use up such water. 

<p>Actually, the reaction may be carried out by heating the alumina and a whole amount of the alkali
metal together or by heating first the alumina with a portion of the alkali metal so as to consume
substantially the water in the alumina and, after the addition of the remaining portion of the alkali
metal, continuing the heating. In the latter case, the alkali metal which is initially used may be the
same as or different from the one employed later. The reaction temperature and the reaction time
may be entirely the same as those mentioned in connection with the procedure using the alkali metal
hydroxide. 

<p>The said alternative procedure may be understood to be substantially the same as the previous
procedure and falling within the scope of this invention, because the reaction is assumed to proceed
as follows: a portion of the alkali metal is first reacted with the water removed from the alumina to
produce the corresponding alkali metal hydroxide and then the remaining portion of the alkali metal,
the produced alkali metal hydroxide and the resultant alumina are reacted with each other. 

<p>Different from a conventional dispersion catalyst wherein an alkali metal is dispersed on a carrier
material having a large surface area such as alumina, silica gel, activated carbon or sodium carbonate
(J.Am.Chem.Soc., 82, 387 (1960)), the thus obtained catalyst does not contain the alkali metal. This is
clearly evidenced by the following facts. 

<p>1. The catalyst of the invention is colored white to gray and does not show any pattern attributed to
the alkali metal as a simple substance in the X ray diffraction pattern (cf. FIG. (c) of the attached
drawings), whereas the dispersion catalyst is colored violet to black and shows a pattern attributed to
the alkali metal as a simple substance in the X ray diffusion pattern (cf. FIGS. (a) and (b) of the
attached drawings). In this connection, it is notable that the active dispersion catalyst shows a color
inherent to the alkali metal as a simple substance such as violet black in case of potassium or black in
case of sodium and, when it turns gray, the catalytic activity is lost (J.Chem.Soc., 1967, 2179). 

<p>2. When treated with liquid ammonia, the catalyst of the invention does not afford any color,
whereas the dipsersion catalyst exhibits sensitively a dark violet color due to the alkali metal as a
simple substance present therein. 

<p>Further, the catalyst of the invention may be differentiated from the dispersion catalyst in the
essential use of the alumina for its preparation. That is, the use of any conventional carrier material
other than and instead of the alumina in the preparation of the catalyst according to the present
invention does not provide any composition having an appreciable catalytic activity, while the
conventional dispersion catalyst prepared by the use of a conventional carrier material other than
alumina such as activated carbon, silica gel or sodium carbonate shows the substantially same
activity as the one prepared by the use of alumina. 

<p>It is particularly notable that the conventional dispersion catalyst is easily ignited on exposure to
air or reacted readily with water to generate hydrogen whereby the catalytic activity is lost, while the
catalyst of this invention is highly stable to air and water and maintains a strong catalytic activity
with a long catalytic life. Thus, the catalyst of this invention can be handled without any special care
in the atmosphere. 

<p>When the reaction of the alkali metal, the alkali metal hydroxide and the alumina according to this
invention is carried out insufficiently and incompletely, the resulting composition may include
unreacted alkali metal and exhibit some characteristics due to the same. The catalytic activity of such
composition is inferior to that of the catalyst obtained by the complete proceeding of the reaction but
still much higher than that of the conventional dispersion catalyst. 

<p>According to the present invention, the alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) is contacted with the said catalyst
to give the corresponding alkenyl-alkoxybenzene wherein the double bond in the alkenyl group is
migrated to a position conjugated with the benzene ring in a nearly quantitative yield and with a high purity. 

<p>Specific examples of the starting alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) are as follows: o-allylanisole,
p-allylanisole, chavicol ethyl ether, methyleugenol, ethyleugenol, isoamyleugenol, benzyleugenol,
2,4-dimethoxy-1-allylbenzene, safrole, myristicin, croweacin, elemicin, apiol, gillapiol,
4-(penten-2-yl)anisole, etc. 

<p>Although any specific limitation does not exist on the amount of the catalyst to be employed, its use
in 1/1000 to 1 part by weight to one part by weight of the starting alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) is usual.
Particularly preferred is 1/100 to 1/5 part by weight of the catalyst to one part by weight of the
starting alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I). 

<p>The isomerization may be effected batchwise or continuously. The starting alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) may be charged in a reaction vessel together with 
the catalyst from the initiation of the reaction or may be continuously or intermittently added to the reaction vessel depending on the proceeding of the 
reaction. 

<p>The isomerization is usually carried out with the starting alkenyl-alkoxybenzene (I) not being preheated. Heating the reaction mixture is not required 
and, even if made, no unfavorable influence on the isomerization is seen. 

<p>If desired, an appropriate inert solvent such as a hydrocarbon (e.g. pentane, hexane, isopentane, dodecane) or ether (e.g. diethylether, tetrahydrofuran,
dioxane) may be employed. For assuring the complete proceeding of the isomerization, the isomerization may be favorably effected in an inert gas. 

<p>The progress of the isomerization is usually examined by gas chromatographic analysis or any other instrumental analysis. Since the reaction proceeds 
quantitatively, the product is of high purity without applying any purification procedure thereto. If desired, however, it may be purified by a per se 
conventional procedure such as distillation or chromatography. 

<p>Specific examples of the thus obtained alkenyl-alkoxybenzene are as follows: o-anethole, p-anethole, p-anol ethyl ether, methylisoeugenol, 
ethylisoeugenol, isoamylisoeugenol, benzylisoeugenol, 2,4-dimethoxy-1-propenylbenzene, isosafrole, isomyristicin, isocroweacin, isoelemicin, isoapiol, 
gillisoapiol, 4-(penten-1-yl)anisole, etc. 

<h3>Description</h3>

Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the invention are illustratively shown in the following examples. 

<h4>Example A</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, activated alumina (50 g) was charged and stirred at 380 to 400 deg. C
for 2 hours under nitrogen. Sodium hydroxide (8.7 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same
temperature, and the resultant mixture was stirred for 20 minutes. Then, metallic sodium (2.0 g) was
portionwise added thereto, whereby the mixture became black but turned gradually white. After
being stirred for 2 hours, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. The
product was not ignited upon exposure to air, and generation of hydrogen was not seen on admixture
with water. 

<h4>Example B</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, activated alumina (50 g) was charged and stirred at 400 deg. C for 2
hours under nitrogen. Sodium hydroxide (8.7 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same
temperature, and the resultant mixture was stirred for 20 minutes. Then, metallic sodium (2.0 g) was
portionwise added thereto, and stirring was continued for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was
allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. The product was colored gray or black due to the presence
of unreacted metallic sodium. 

<h4>Example C</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, activated alumina (50 g) was charged and stirred at 400 to 420 deg. C
for 1.5 hours under nitrogen. Potassium hydroxide (12.2 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same
temperature, and the resultant mixture was stirred for 40 minutes. Then, metallic potassium (1.5 g)
was portionwise added thereto over 10 minutes, and stirring was continued for 2 hours at the same
temperature. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. 

<h4>Example D</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, activated alumina (50 g) was charged and stirred at 400 to 420 deg. C
for 2.5 hours under nitrogen. Sodium hydroxide (8.7 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same
temperature, and the resultant mixture was stirred for 70 minutes. Then, metallic potassium (1.5 g)
was portionwise added thereto over 10 minutes, whereby the mixture became violet but turned
gradually white. After being stirred for 2 hours, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to give a
catalyst product. 

<h4>Example E</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, alumina mainly consisting of .gamma. type (water content, 6.0 %) (50
g) was charged and heated up to 200 deg. C under nitrogen while stirring. Metallic sodium (3.8 g)
was portionwise added thereto at the same temperature over 20 minutes, and the resultant mixture
was stirred for 1 hour. Then, the temperature was gradually raised up to 400 deg. C, and metallic
sodium (1.9 g) was portionwise added thereto over 10 minutes. Stirring was continued at the same
temperature for 3.5 hours to give a catalyst product. The product was colored white, and the absence
of metallic sodium was confirmed by the X ray diffraction. 

<h4>Example F</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, alumina mainly consisting of chi and .gamma. types (water content,
1.6 %) (50 g) was charged and heated up to 400 deg. C under nitrogen while stirring. Metallic
potassium (1.8 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same temperature over 7 minutes, and the
resultant mixture was stirred for 2 hours and allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. The product
was colored greyish white, and the absence of metallic potassium was confirmed by the X ray
diffraction. 

<h4>Example G</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, .gamma.-type alumina containing 10 % boehmite (50 g) was charged
and heated up to 400 deg. C under nitrogen while stirring. Metallic sodium (1.9 g) was portionwise
added thereto at the same temperature over 5 minutes, and the resultant mixture was stirred for 2
hours and allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. 

<h4>Example H</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, alumina mainly consisting of chi and .gamma. types (water content,
2.0 %) (50 g) was charged and heated up to 400 deg. C under nitrogen while stirring. Metallic sodium
(2.5 g) was portionwise added thereto at the same temperature over 5 minutes, and the resultant
mixture was stirred for 2 hours and allowed to cool to give a catalyst product. The product was
colored black partly due to the presence of unreacted metallic sodium. 

<h4>Example I</h4>

In a 100 ml four-necked flask, alumina mainly consisting of .rho. type (water content, 8 %) (50 g)
was charged and heated up to 300 deg. C under nitrogen while stirring. Metallic sodium (5.2 g) was
portionwise added thereto at the same temperature over 15 minutes, and the resultant mixture was
stirred for 1 hour. Then, the temperature was gradually raised up to 400 deg. C, and metallic sodium
(1.8 g) was added thereto over 5 minutes. Stirring was continued at the same temperature for 2 hours,
and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to give a catalyst product.
