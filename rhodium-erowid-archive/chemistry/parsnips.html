<br>When concentrations are given in parts per million, this figure refers to the dried plant material. It may not be very relevant to the amount which can be obtained
from the essential oil. Also, this is a very partial (incomplete) list. Many plants known to have useful oils are not listed.
<br>
<br>Coming: enthusiastic endorsements of particular plants, notable for the value of their oils --- to us.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>The Pied Pipers</b>
<br>
<br>At a costume party, or in a show, did you ever see anybody in a "domino",
quartered black and white? Through the Middle Ages, that was a secret signal of
heretical attitude, wearing a garmet in which the colors were not symmetrical.
The word "pied" refers to this style of clothing, with mismatched sleeves and
legs. It was connected with the uncontrollable tarantella dance, and the overall
ignification refers back to the community fear of ergotism, as a plague. Dancers
clad in these motley outfits would cavort through a town to draw off the
chances of the residents inexplicably tripping out. Moldy rye bread was not a
good way to get off; it had too many side effects, often fatal, from the mixed
ergotamines. The Pied Piper legend reflected the fear that the children would be
drawn into psychedelic realms never to return, by music which was
supernaturally enthralling.
<br>
<br>After some centuries, this has happened. There is of course no connection
between pepper plants and musicians who tweedle on clay flutes, to lure
youngsters from home and hearth. It is a mere homonym. By coincidence, it so
happens that plants of the genus Piper are chock full of a wide variety of
phenylpropanoids. Useful essential oils are the rule, and not the exception, among pepper species.
<br>
<br>There are no common names in English for most of the Piper genus, since they
are tropical plants. There are dozens of them, vanishing from warm forests
around the world. There are Spanish and Portuguese names, commonly used to
denote these Piper plants in Mesoamerica and South America, because that's
what people speak where they occur. We know about Piper negrum, black
pepper, though most of us haven't seen the plant. We know about Piper betel,
because in Pacifica they chew the leaves. Piper methysticum likewise. I don't
know of any import restrictions on plant products from any of the species of
genus Piper.
<br>
<br>(I'd shy away from ordering any foreign essential oil known to contain more than
30% safrole unless I knew more about what I was doing. That's an important
distinction: the plant parts, dried, cut and sifted, or powdered, in most cases even a solid concentrated extractive, may be ordered from overseas sources without undue concern, for it is unlikely anyone is funded to scrutinize transaction patterns in the immense herb market.)
<br>
<br>
<br>Piper aduncum
<br><img src="pictures/piper-aduncum.jpg" align="left" hspace="30" vspace="30">
<br>
<br>Piper aduncum. That's from aduncus: bent, crooked, curved, hooked. Not
because it's a shady character, but because its leaves flop down. It may as well
be a shady character, considering all its aliases. It has no fewer than 27(!)
synonyms in the published literature, that's binomial Latin nomenclature. The
main one is P. angustifolium, these are the same plant. What you asked, its
English common name, is Matico pepper (as P. angustifolium), or Spiked pepper
(as P. aduncum). In Spanish it's Cordoncillo or Higuillo de Hoja Menuda;
Portugese, Aperta-ruao. The Chinese have a name for it, Xia ye hu jiao.
<br>
<br>Piper auritum
<br><img src="pictures/piper-auritum2.jpg" align="left" hspace="30" vspace="30">
<br>
<br>Piper auritum too, Mo xi ge hu jiao or, Mo xi ge hu jiao ye. This one has the
erstwhile scientific pseudonyms Piper sanctum and Artanthe sanctum, of course
referring to the Mexican pepperleaf, Sacred pepper, or Veracruz pepper. The
Spanish names are Acuyo, Anisillo, Cordocillo, Hoja de Ajan, Hoja de Santa Maria,
Santilla de comer, Hoja santa, Yerba santa, and others regionally. It's sacred and
a comestible at the same time.
<br>
<br>Piper aduncum and Piper auritum. These are not cute little pepper bushes for
long. By their second season they shoot up into fuckin TREES, leave them alone
and they will reach 6 meters into the air. It's a jungle out there, dripping with
(well, half of 1%) essential oil. Fast growing, well you might call it that.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Then it grows up...
<br><img src="pictures/piper-auritum3.jpg" align="left" hspace="30" vspace="30">
<br>
<br>Piper auritum takes over by blocking sunlight to the ground, with its huge el
monstro safrolio leaves, the size of elephant ears but round. In Mexico, these
rootbeerio fragrant leaves are used to wrap baked fish, tamale style, yum. A
sacred plant that's edible.
<br>
<br>Both these plants are naturalized throughout Pacifica, if you were wondering
about the Chinese names. I spared you the Fijian names, but in some islands
they are called false kava, particularly P. aduncum. They are effective pioneer
species in disturbed habitats, preventing erosion of sloping land, for example.
They spread into cleared or abandoned land, and keep it from degenerating into
nonproductive grassland. Their seeds are viable in bat shit, and fruit bats love
these plants.
<br>
<br>One or the other may be considered noxious weeds in places like Florida,
Australia, Singapore, and Hawaii, and if you live on an island in the Pacific well
fuck you. What I'm saying is that they're easy to grow, and if you get some,
you'll never have to look for another place to get safrole. Or dillapiole, as the
case may be. Try both, for varied flavors.
<br>
<br>Piper auritum oil is 80% safrole. Piper hispidinervem oil has 86% safrole, but P.
auritum is more available, outside of Brazil. The Mexicans consider P. auritum as
a food, not an herb. Piper aduncum oil is 80% dillapiole! Don't go looking for
these oils as a commodity, though in Brazil and Peru they may be sold as such.
The plant materials are available as a product you may import as herbs. They are
mentioned because P. auritum and P. aduncum grow in North America, and both
are available on the market as live plants, and both are invasive escapees in
South Florida. This info is for those who wish to grow their own plants, and
extract their own essential oils from them. If that ain't you, just never mind.
<br>


<br> Wild Ginger!
<br>   Parsley!
<br>   Parsnips!
<br>
<br><b>Asarum species (formerly Asiasarum) -- wild ginger</b>
<br>
<br>I found a natural source of croweacin, that's not Eristomon croweii. It is an
Asian species of wild ginger, Asarum sieboldii. Asarum sieboldii oil has 14.5%
croweacin. That beats the pants off the oil obtained from Asarum
heterotropoides, which can only offer 3.4% elemicin and 12% safrole. You can
get either of these plants as a dried Chinese herb, Xi Xin. Undoubtedly they are
very good at treating the appropriate dried Chinese complaint. Problem is,
ordering from a dried Chinese herb merchant, you may not know which one of
these you're getting. Well? Can you handle that? The chemistry's pretty much
the same, for most allylbenzenes. North American wild gingers, Asarum
canadense and the dozen or so other species, are not so rich in
phenylpropanoids as the Asian species. They are still worth going after, if you
know your woods lore, and can collect them free.
<br>
<br>Tip: Chinese dried herbs are dirt cheap, even after the shipping and duties.
Check out their prices on Acorus calamus and you'll see what I mean.
<br>
<br><b>Acorus species -- sweet flag</b>
<br>
<br>A. calamus root oil is over 50% asarone. Asarone is a bit harder to handle
chemically, than most of the allylbenzene phenylpropanoids, because it's very
acid sensitive, but it's worth the trouble. A. calamus root is very rich in oil, ~ 5%
by weight. In contrast, A. gramineus root only has 1/10 the oil content, though
the oil is over 70% asarone. The economic tradeoff says if you're buying oil, get
the gramineus if you can find it; buying herb, get the calamus. As I said,
asarone chemistry isn't for newbies. I'd like to know about the oxone oxidation on
asarone, though.
<br>
<br><b>Illicium species -- star anise</b>
<br>
<br>Something else that makes me curious. Isosafrole is said to be a "principal
constituent" of star anise oil. How much does that mean? The FDA, working with
their fuck buddies the DEA, likes to clamp down on oils with more than 30%
safrole content. Could it be that they fuktup and didn't include isosaf in this?
Performic! (gesundheit)
<br>
<br>Star anise oil is from the fruiting bodies, carpels, of Illicium verum, aka I.
anisatum. Two closely related species are I. floridanum and I. parviflorum, which
grow in North America. I. floridanum has 13 seeds per cluster, but I. parviflorum
is even more closely related to I. verum, for it has 8 seeds like I. verum. Both
these plants produce essential oils in their leaves, composed of 90% safrole.
What I want to know is, do the seed carpels produce isosafrole like I. verum, or
just plain old safrole like the leaves? The essential oil content of the seed pods is
greater than 10% by weight, hoo boy.
<br>
<br>My buddy SWIM's experience leads me to expect that the North American
species of Illicium produce their essential oil seasonally, like Sassafras albidum
does. I say this because SWIM has been very disappointed in the oil yield, from
both the leaves and seed carpels, gathered in spring.
<br>
<br><b>Pastinaca sativa -- the parsnip</b>
<br>
<br>The most impressive figure from the list above is 662,000 parts per million of
myristicin, from the roots of parsnips. The essential oil present in this food is
66.2% myristicin. By comparison, the oil derived from the seeds of nutmegs have
much less myristicin than this, for this oil is only about 8% myristicin. If anybody
might want to contrive anything like MMDA
(3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenylisopropylamine, active @ 100-250 mg) for any
reason, myristicin would be the starting point.
<br>
<br>I have received a report from one party known to us here, that the oil yield from
grocery store parsnips was negligible. They are not grown nor sold in my region,
so I can't tell you.
<br>
<br><b>Umbillifer foods: condiments, herbs, and spices</b>
<br>
<br>All the umbillifer spices have useful phenylpropanoids in their essential oils,
period. That's carrots and celery and dill and fennel and parsley and coriander
and cardomom and tarragon and so on and so forth. The problem in many cases,
is that their phenylpropanoids often contain monomethoxylated (p-methoxy)
benzene rings. The main chore is getting rid of the anethole and/or methyl
chavicol in fractional vacuum distillation, because PMA isn't stylish any more.
These oils are an innocent purchase even in bulk.
<br>
<br><b>Petroselinum crispum -- parsley</b>
The star among these is parsley. Parsley seed oil from Eastern Europe and
Germany will contain over 50% useful phenylpropanoids, no anethole. A typical
Bulgarian seed oil contains 2% elemicin, 34% myristicin, and 16% apiole. The
apiole will solidify out of the whole oil below 15 degrees, so it must be even
easier to separate once the terpenes have been boiled off below 200 degrees.
The leaf oil will also give myristicin and a bit of apiole, but the root oil and
especially the seed oil is much better, at a vastly lower cost.
<br>
<br><b>Anethum graveolens -- dill weed</b>
<br>
<br>Dill (Anethum graveolens) is opposite of parsley, with respect to where the good
phenylpropanoids may be found. American style dill herb oil, is in fact a rich
repository of precursor phenylpropanoids, specifically dillapiole. In this case, more
so than dill seed oil (which is actually made from the fruits, but it is
conventionally called "seed" oil). I am not aware of the details of how "American
style dill weed oil", as it is internationally known, is processed, but I expect it
may be from all the aerial parts of the plant.
<br>
And there's more...
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Mostlies:
<br>Oils which have a majority of goodies</b>
<br>
<br>Let's run down those essential oils we know are more than half phenylpropanoids
which can be used for entheogen/enactogen raw materials, not counting PMA.
What we're trying to do here is lure the sudafed ppl away from their red P and
iodine, by showing what can be done with about twice the work. And about 5, 6
or 11 times the outlay for equipment, too. Plus a bit more studying. (My sales
pitch could use a bit of polishing, I think.)
<br>
<br>Safrole:
<br>
<br>Sassafras albidum, the sassafras tree. The root bark of this tree contains the
original sassafras oil. The tree is a pioneer species, in the regrowth of disturbed
former forest land throughout Eastern North America. No, not Canada, and rarely
in New England, but in the more comfy parts of the East, including East Texas.
You can't buy the oil any more in bulk, for all practical purposes, unless you're a
corporation. The narks are suspicious. You can buy the roots, the root bark, or
the powdered root bark, paradoxically without attention. You can buy the tree
saplings, or the seeds. Or, more sensibly, you can go outside and gather the
roots yourself for free, to make your own oil from the bark.
<br>
<br>Cinnamomun camphorae, the camphor tree. The initial essential oil of the wood
is 50% camphor, but once the camphor has been congealed out, the brown
camphor oil which remains is 95% safrole. A noxious weed species in North
Florida, this tree has taken over vast forests. Government agencies there are
attempting to reduce its numbers, are cutting it down and grinding it up, giving
away its wood chips for free to use for mulch. No one has ever thought of boiling
out its essential oil. Available for free there:
http://aquat1.ifas.ufl.edu/camphor.html but don't call them. Go find a landowner
and pay him a hundred bucks for his tree, be discreet. It also counts as discreet
if you're sneaky. One tree will provide a lifetime supply of safrole, for you and
your 30,000 closest friends.
<br>
<br>Ocotea cymbarum, the Brazilian sassafras. The wood of this tree contains an
essential oil which is 92% safrole. Availabile as seeds, if you can find them.
<br>
<br>Piper hispidinervum, Brazil's cultivated answer to its vanishing stocks of
wildcrafted Ocotea cymbarum. 86% safrole content in its leaves. Availability, as
seeds, is difficult.
<br>
<br>Hoja santa, Piper auritum of the jungle picture above, all sources agree at 80%
safrole. Available as live plants and seeds.
<br>
<br>Illicium, star anise, the American plants Illicium floridanum and I. parviflorum
have a much higher safrole content than the Chinese herb Star anise, Illicium
verum. The report of 90% safrole in the oil is all I've seen. Plants and seeds are
readily available.
<br>
<br>Not safrole:
<br>
<br>Essential oil of parsnips, Pastinaca sativa, mostly myristicin. Availability universal,
where parsnips grow. I'm not there, so I have no idea about the steam
distillation.
<br>
<br>Parsley, Petroselinum crispum, essential oil of Eastern European seed is 37%
myristicin, 16% apiole, and 2% elemicin. This makes it an oil with a majority of
phenylpropanoids. The seed oil is better than the root oil which is better than the
herb oil which is better than the leaf oil, for our purposes. Available.
<br>
<br>Matico, Piper aduncum (=P. angustifolium, P. elongatum). Reports from different
strains range up to 88.2% dillapiole. Available as dried Matico herb, and as seed,
but live plants are hard to locate.
<br>
<br>Calamus, Acorus calamus oil from India is generally 50-70% asarone. American oil
is lower, and there are chemotypes which make the asarone content variable. A.
gramineus oil has a consistently higher asarone content. Plants, seeds, herb and
oil are universally available.
<br>
<br>Ashanti pepper, Benin pepper, false cubeb. This pepper species is Piper guineese
(= Piper clusii). The oil from the spice does not have significant amounts of
phenylpropanoids, but the oil from the leaves is composed mostly of dillapiole,
myristicin and elemicin. Sorry, but I just can't find anyplace to get this plant, its
leaves, nor its seeds, without going to West Africa.
<br>
<br>Well, that's the roundup for now. These are all essential oils with over 50% precursor ingeredients. I'm sure there are others, so if you stumble across any,
post it here for us. (Note that I'm not including eugenol, anethole, nor methyl chavicol, for I don't consider these particular phenylpropanoids useful for us.)</b>
