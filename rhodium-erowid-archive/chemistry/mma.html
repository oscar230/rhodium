<b><font color="blue">Synthesis of the 3-hydroxy-4-methyl derivative of amphetamine.</b>
</font color="blue">  from V.Valenta and M.Protiva, <i>Coll Czech Chem Commun 42, 1977 </i>

</p>

<p>

<b>Abstract:</b>

</p>

<p>

<i>p-Toluic acid was converted in seven steps to (3-methoxy-4-methylphenyl)acetonitrile (VIII) which underwent Claisen's reaction with ethyl acetate and subsequent acid
hydrolysis to the phenylacetone derivative XI. Leuckart's reaction and alkaline hydrolysis of the product gave rise to 3-methoxy-4-methylamphetamine (XIII) which was
demethylated with hydrobromic acid to the title compound I.</i>

</p>

<p>

<b>Introduction:</b>

</p>

<p>

Carlsson and coworkers (ref 1,2) prepared the 3-hydroxy-4-methyl derivative of amphetamine I which in histochemical and biochemical experiments on rats and mice, depresses
with extraordinary intensity the levels of norepinephrine in central and peripheral neurones {brain and heart)

</p>

<p>

<font color="green"><b>Chimimanie's voice:</b> So it's a vile compound BUT if you don't do the last step (demethylation) you have got 3-methoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine which is
an acceptable analogue of MDA</font>

</p>

<p>

(...)

</p>

<p>

ref 1,2 desribe its preparation in two parallel ways which proceed from 3-methoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde and from 3-benzyloxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde (obtained from the
corresponding acids by Rosenmund's reaction) which react wIth nitroethane to yield the corresponding substituted nitrostyrenes. Reduction with lithium aluminium hydride
yielded 1-(3-methoxy-4-methyl)-2-propylamine and 1-(3-benzyloxy-4-methyl)-2-propylamine; to obtain I, the first of these was demethylated with hydrobromic acid, the other was
debenzylated by catalytic hydrogenation. We developed an alternative synthesis which, although somewhat longer as to the number of steps, is advantageous because it employs
simple reactions and gives a high yield.

litre ethanol and the mixture was hydrogenated at normal pressure and with gentle heating. Theoretical consumption of hydrogen was reached in 5 h; it was filtered and the
solution was evaporated. A total of 93.8 g (94%) crystalline product was obtained; mp 166.5-167.5�C. Ref.16 reports for a product obtained by reduction of II with stannous

<h4>4-methyl-3-nitrobenzaldehyde</h4>

<p>36.0 g (0.3 mol) 4-methylbenzaldehyde is nitrated with KNO3 in concentrated H2SO4 [20]. Recrystallization from ether gave brightly yellow coloured needles; yield 45.0 g (91%), mp: 47�C (from ether) (literature [20] 43-44�C from ether, 48-49�C from petroleum ether).</p>

<h4>3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde</h4>

<p>60.0 g (0.36 mol) 4-methyl-3-nitrobenzaldehyde was reduced applying SnCl2.2H2O (according [13]), subjected to a diazotation reaction involving NaNO2 and HCl, and boiled down to the phenol. When there was no more nitrogen gas evolution, the mixture was treated with activated coal. It was filtered while hot and allowed to cool down for 16 h, after which the precipitated phenol was sucked away. Some more phenol can be obtained by extracting the filtrate with DCM. Crystallization of the raw product from benzene yields 29.0 g (60%) of the phenol (literature [13] 60%), mp: 71-72�C (from benzene) (literature [13] 73�C)</p>

<h4>3-methoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde</h4>

<p> 40 mL (30.0 g, 0.42 mol) dimethyl sulfate (DMS) is added to 25.0 g (16.7 mmol) 3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde dissolved in 45 mL 33% KOH. Fierce stirring is necessary, and the temperature is not allowed to exceed 45�C. Otherwise, cooling is necessary. After 20 minutes, 15 mL 33% KOH and 10.5 g (14 mL, 0.15 mol) DMS are simultaneously drop-wise added. This is repeated after 10 min, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 more min. The mixture is diluted with 60 mL 33% KOH and allowed to rest at room temperature for two hours. The mixture is extracted with 1 x 200 mL and 2 x 100 mL chloroform, the combined extracts washed zith water, dried over Na2SO4 and freed from solvent in vacuo. The residue is crystallized from ether/n-hexane, yielding 29.0 g (91%) (literature [13] 87%), mp: 45-46�C (from ether/n-hexane) (literature [13] 42-43�C).</p>

<p>4-methyl-3-nitrobenzaldehyde (110 g) was added at once to a solution of SnCl2.2H2O (450 g) in 35% HCl (600 mL). The reaction was highly exothermic. As soon as the
inner temperature of the reaction mixture reached at 100�C, the mixture was cooled to 0-5�C with ice-cooling. The resulting precipitates (stannic complex of 3-amino-4-methylbenzaldehyde) were filtered off and used to the following diazotization reaction without purification.</p>

<p>To the suspended mixture of the complex in 35% HCl (600 mL)
was added dropwise at 4-5�C a solution of NaNO2 (46 g) in H2O (50 mL) for 50 min. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h, and the resulting pale yellow
precipitates were filtered off. A solid of the dizaonium salt was added in portions to refluxing water (1.71) over 30 min and after evolution of nitrogen gas ceased, the
mixture was cooled and extracted with DCM. Concentration of DCM extracts gave a crude product, which was purified by DCM elution through a short silica gel layer and by
recystallization from benzene. Yield of 3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde [1] was 54.5 g (60%).</p>

<p>To a solution of 3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde (10.6 g) in 2 N NaOH (60 mL)
was added dropwise at 40-45�C Me2SO4 (15.9 g) for 10 min. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 h, cooled to 20�C and extracted with ether (150 mL). Usual
work-up and recrystallization from n-hexane gave colorless needles (8.6 g, 88.5%) of 3-methoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde, which melted at 45-46�C (lit [2] bp 101-103�C/10^-4
mmHg).</p>
