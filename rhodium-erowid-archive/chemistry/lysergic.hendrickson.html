<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>(�)-Lysergic acid (<strong>1</strong>) has been synthesized via an economical 8-step route from 4-bromoindole and isocinchomeronic acid without the need to protect the
indole during the synthesis. Initial efforts to form the simpler 3-acylindole derivatives first and then cyclize these were unsuccessful in the cyclization step.</p>

</div>

<p>The ergot alkaloids pose an unusual opportunity for synthesis. The central alkaloids are all amides of
lysergic acid (<strong>1</strong>) and all possess a broad range of pharmacological activity<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>1-3</sup></a>. Only one of these, the
diethylamide (LSD), however, is strongly and notoriously psychoactive. As such it is listed as a class I
controlled substance. Since both the natural and synthetic derivatives are easily convertible to lysergic acid
and so to its diethylamide, all of these are also controlled substances. As a result this potential
pharmacological treasure is essentially unavailable for practical clinical testing.</p>

<p>Bondset of lysergic acid synthesis.<br> </p> 
</div>

<p>We considered that a derivative of lysergic acid bearing an unremoveable substituent, like an added C-alkyl
group, could not be converted to lysergic acid itself or its amide. Such derivatives would probably retain the
broad pharmacological activity of the ergot family but might easily avoid the unique hallucinogenic property
of LSD. This idea encouraged us to seek a short, practical synthesis route to lysergic acid suitable for
incorporation of C-alkyl starting materials to create these derivatives.</p>

<p>Lysergic acid has already been synthesized about eight times<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. The shortest path 
has 11 steps and none are serious candidates for practical manufacture. Every synthesis to date contains redundant
protection/deprotection sequences, often as indole starting materials reduced and acylated, only at the end
reconstituted to the indole form. To eliminate this redundancy we decided that the indole should be carried
through intact.</p>

<p>Attempt via Bondset <strong>ba</strong> Approach<em><sup><em>aa</em></sup></em> 
<br><strong>Reagents: <em>(i)</em></strong> EMgBr/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>/Et<sub>2</sub>O.</p> 
</div>

<p> <br><br>The simplest convergent bondset for assembling the lysergic skeleton should be the boldface bonds in ring <strong>C</strong>, 
which just arise from indole and nicotinic acid starting materials. No previous syntheses had utilized this approach 
except the Julia route, which did not carry the indole moiety through unchanged.</p>

<p>Of the two initial constructions necessary for the bondset in <strong>Figure 1</strong> we began with the simplest (bond <strong>b</strong>)
via an acylation of indole or 4-haloindoles<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> <strong>2</strong> with the acid chloride <strong>3</strong> from the commercially available
6-carboxynicotinic acid (isocinchomeronic acid), as outlined in <strong>Scheme 1</strong>. The acid was esterified, selectively
hydrolyzed only at the 6-position<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> with aqueous Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and converted (SOCl<sub>2</sub>) to <strong>3</strong>. The Grignard reagents
from <strong>2</strong> were acylated with <strong>3</strong> to form <strong>4</strong>. However, a number of attempts at palladium-catalyzed cyclizations of <strong>4</strong> (X = Br or I) or reduced pyridine derivatives of <strong>4</strong> and their N-methyl salts were all unsuccessful.</p>

<p>We also considered that a thermal pericyclic cyclization of the anion <strong>5</strong> of <strong>4</strong> might be accessible with
subsequent loss of HX to form <strong>6</strong>, but several trials of this at elevated temperatures, with or without added
base, led only to intractable tars.</p>

<p>The alternative path to close ring <strong>C</strong>, making bond a first, was ultimately successful, as summarized in
<strong>Scheme 2</strong>. For this approach we needed a nicotinic acid derivative with a halogen marking the 5-position.</p>

<p>The common introduction of halogen on pyridines, via SOCl<sub>2</sub> on the N-oxide<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, provides only the ortho/para
halides. However, sulfonyl halides can give rise to meta substitution<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> and the reaction of the N-oxide of
6-carboxynicotinic acid with thionyl chloride affords<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> the <em>m</em>-chloro derivative <strong>7</strong> on workup with methanol. We
believe this results from first forming the normal, nonplanar <em>p</em>-chloro intermediate in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, which can
then collapse via the pericyclic rearrangement shown and subsequent loss of the <em>p</em>-chloride to afford <strong>7</strong>.</p>

<p>Proposed mechanism for formation of <strong>7</strong>.</p><p> </p> 
</div>


<p> </p>

<p>When the 4-haloindoles <strong>2</strong> were converted to the boronic acid <strong>8</strong> (via KH + BuLi and B(<em>n</em>-BuO)<sub>3</sub>), the Suzuki
coupling was successful in forming <strong>9a</strong> in 91% yield. While this work was in progress, a closely related
reaction appeared in a note by Doll<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> coupling <strong>8</strong> with 5-bromonicotinic ester, but the subsequent addition of
the missing carbon 4 for lysergic acid failed.</p>

<p>We presumed that an appropriate base would easily initiate the cyclization of the diester <strong>9a</strong> to the
tetracyclic ketone corresponding to <strong>10</strong>. However, treatment of the diester with NaH, even in glycol at 197&deg;C,
yielded only starting material. A number of attempts to cyclize the corresponding, very insoluble diacid with
thionyl chloride or variants of PPA led only to recovery of diacid or intractable mixtures with no evidence of
cyclization.</p>

<p>Following a similar but intermolecular version from Potier<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> we reduced the ester selectively<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> with NaBH<sub>4</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> to <strong>9b</strong> and then oxidized it to the aldehyde <strong>9c</strong> with MnO<sub>2</sub>. The aldehyde cyclized at room temperature
easily and quantitatively with only 2 mol% of NaOH to yield <strong>10</strong>. Various efforts to cyclize the alcohol <strong>9b</strong> or
its tosylate to <strong>11</strong> all recovered only starting materials. The difference in the ease of cyclization of <strong>9c</strong> over
its precursors surprised us but we became convinced from models that there was severe steric resistance to the
stereoelectronic demands for cyclization except for the aldehyde case.</p>

<p>Typical reduction<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> of the indole-alcohol <strong>10</strong> with NaBH<sub>4</sub>/TFA afforded <strong>11</strong>, which proved to be unstable,
decomposing in a matter of hours. Accordingly, the remaining steps were carried through without isolation.
Freshly prepared <strong>11</strong> was methylated directly with methyl iodide and the crude salt <strong>12</strong> reduced with excess NaBH<sub>4</sub> in methanol to a mixture of methyl lysergate and its <em>cis</em>-isomer isolysergate in a 6:1 ratio, as a pale yellow
solid.</p>

<p>These diastereomers are reported to be somewhat unstable<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> and so were immediately hydrolyzed to lysergic
acid with NaOH, which also equilibrated them to the more stable lysergic acid, which was then finally
recrystallized to mp 241-242&deg;C (lit. 242-243�C).</p>

<p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the mixed esters were identical with spectra kindly provided by Prof. Ichiya
Ninomiya, and the NMR spectra (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C) of the lysergic acid agreed with that of a natural sample kindly
provided by Dr. David Nichols.</p>

<p>The last three operations (<strong>10</strong> to <strong>1</strong>) are carried out easily in good yield without isolation and
purification; this result lends value to the initial conception in <strong>Figure 1</strong> that the most economical synthesis
of lysergic acid is one that originates in the two main starting materials, a simple indole and a nicotinic
acid derivative, both retaining their aromaticity to the very end. This synthesis comprises eight steps from
isocinchomeronic acid and 4-bromoindole and proceeds in an unoptimized overall yield of 10.6%. Chirality is
only introduced in the final reduction step, and enantioselective measures for this reduction have not yet
been examined, nor has the parallel synthesis of C-alkyl derivatives.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 400 MHz instrument at
ambient temperature using TMS as internal standard and CDCl<sub>3</sub> as solvent. Mass
spectrometry was recorded on the Micromass QUATTRO II instrument. The solvents and
reagents were purified by the following methods: diethyl ether, glyme and THF were
distilled from sodium with benzophenone as an indicator. DMF, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and xylene were
distilled from calcium hydride. Benzene and toluene were distilled from P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Methanol
and ethanol were dried over magnesium. Triglyme was distilled from LiAlH<sub>4</sub>.
Trimethylamine was distilled from NaOH. Anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> has been roasted in a
crucible and allowed to cool in a desiccator.</p>

<h4>1. 4-Bromo-indole (2a)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 3-methoxycarbonylindole (7.0g, 40.0mmol) in TFA was added Thallium(III) trifluoroacetate (32.6g, 60.0 mmol) in TFA (140 ml), and the mixture was stirred for
2 hours at r.t. After TFA was evaporated in vacuo, a dark brown oil was obtained. This
oil was dissolved in DMF (100 ml) and CuBr<sub>2</sub> (35.8g, 160.0 mmol) was added. The
reaction was stirred at 120�C for 1 hour then was cooled and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH (95:5, v/v)
(300 ml) was added. Insoluble precipitates were filtered off through a plug of celite. The
filtrate was washed with brine (100 ml x 2), and the organic layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
A crystalline material (7.60g) was obtained in 63% yield after the removal of solvent
under reduced pressure. This material was directly subjected to decarboxylation for the
preparation of 4-bromo-indole in the next step.
To a solution of 4-bromo-indole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (5.06g, 20.0 mmol) in 200
ml methanol was added 200 ml of 40% aq. NaOH. The reaction was refluxed for 1.5 h
with stirring. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was poured into 200 ml water,
and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH (95:5, v/v; 200 ml x 3). The extract was washed with
brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and evaporated in vacuo to leave a brown oil. Purification by
chromatography using hexane:ethyl acetate (6:1) afforded a light colored oil (2.68 g) in
69.1% yield.</p>

<h4>2. 4-Iodo-indole (2b)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 3-methoxycarbonylindole (7.0g, 40.0mmol) in TFA was added Thallium(III) trifluoroacetate (32.6g, 60.0 mmol) in TFA (140 ml), and the mixture was stirred for
2 hours at r.t. After TFA was evaporated in vacuo, a dark brown oil was obtained. This
oil was suspended in 450 ml H<sub>2</sub>O, and KI (19.9 g, 120.0 mmol) was added to this
suspension. The reaction was stirred at r. t. for 2 hours. CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH (95:5, v/v) (300
ml) was added to the reaction mixture and insoluble precipitates were filtered off through
a plug of celite. The organic layer was separated and washed with aq. sodium thiosulfate
then brine. Removal of the solvent left a brownish solid. Quick purification by a short
plug of silica gel afforded a white solid (8.68g) as 4-iodo-indole-3-carboxylic acid methyl
ester in 72.1% yield. This material was used directly in the next step.
To a solution of 4-iodo-indole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (6.02g, 20.0 mmol) in 200
ml methanol was added 200 ml of 40% aq. NaOH. The reaction was refluxed for 1.5 h
with stirring. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was poured into 200 ml water,
and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH (95:5, v/v; 200 ml x 3). The extract was washed with
brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and evaporated in vacuo to leave an off-white solid.
Purification by chromatography using hexane : ethyl acetate (6:1) afforded a white
crystalline solid (3.51g) in 72.3% yield.</p>

<h4>3. Pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid 5-methyl ester (3)</h4>

<p>To a solution of pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (5.91g, 30 mmol) in 100
ml methanol was added copper(II)nitrate trihydrate (14.5g, 60 mmol) in a 500 ml round
bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirring bar. The reaction was
refluxed for 80 mins. A deep violet-blue precipitation was observed after 20 mins and
lasted throughout the course of the reaction. The reaction was cooled to r.t., and the
reaction mixture was reduced to 1/3 of its original volume. The deep violet-blue solid
was collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol then cold water. This solid
material was dissolved in 50 ml glyme, and H<sub>2</sub>S gas was bubbled into the solution. The
black precipitate was formed in 2 mins, and the deep violet-blue solid disappeared after
15 mins. The black precipitate was filtered out through a plug of celite and the filtrate
was concentrated to 20 ml. Excess hexanes were added into this solution, and a white
solid was formed. The white solid was collected by filtration. Recrystallization of this
solid from acetone afforded 4.83g product in 88.9% yield (mp 194.1-195.1�C, Lit<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>).</p>

<h4>4. 6-(4-Iodo-indole-3-carbonyl)-nicotinic acid methyl ester (4b)</h4>

<p>To a solution of EtMgBr (10 ml, 1.575 M in ether, 15.75 mmol) was added a solution of
4-iodo-<em>1H</em>-indole (3.65g, 15.0 mmol) in ether (anhydrous, 20 ml). The resulting twophase
system was allowed to stand for 15 min under stirring whereupon ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (15 ml,
1.0m in ether, 15.0 mmol) was added with stirring. The two-phase system was allowed to
stand for 30 min when 6-chlorocarbonyl-nicotinic acid methyl ester (3.14g, 15.75 mmol)
in anhydrous ether (10 ml) was added rapidly under vigorous stirring. The reaction
mixture was allowed to stand for 2 hours whereupon NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (aq. sat. 25 ml) was added.
The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (3x50
ml). The combined organic layer was washed with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (aq. sat. 25 ml) followed
by brine (25 ml), and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Removal of the solvent in vacuo afforded a
yellowish solid. Recrystallization of this solid from acetone afforded 4.25g of the desired
crystalline product (mp. 245.7-246.8�C) in 69.8% yield.</p>

<h4>5. 3-Chloro-pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (7)</h4>

<p>Pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (8.35g, 50.0 mmol) was suspended in 250ml 0.2% (w/w)
aq. Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> (0.5g) in a 1 liter round bottom flask. To this solution was added H2O2 in
water (30% w/w, 8.5g, 75.0 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred and heated at 80-
85�C for 10 hours. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold
water. Drying the material under vacuum overnight yielded 9.06 g product solid (mp.
253.2-254.1�C, dec; Lit.<a href="lysergic.hendrickson.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> 254�C, dec.) as pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid N-oxide in 99%
yield. This solid was used in the next step.</p>

<p>To a solution of thionyl chloride (9.52g, 5.84 ml, 80 mmol) in 200 ml CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was added
DMF (2 ml) at 0�C. Pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid N-oxide (3.66g, 20.0 mmol) was
added into this mixture portionwise. The resulting mixture was heated at 65�C for 2
hours. The reaction was cooled to r.t. then placed in an ice-bath. The reaction was
quenched with methanol (30 ml) slowly at 0�C. The solvent was removed in vacuo and
the crude product was partitioned between CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (100 ml) and aq. NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (sat. 50
ml). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (100 ml x 2). The combined organic layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and the solvent
was removed in vacuo. Purification of the crude oil through a short plug of silica gel
using hexane : ethyl acetate (2:1) afforded a white solid (3.73g, mp. 126.0-127.0�C) in
81.2% yield.</p>

<h4>6. Indole-4-boronic acid (8)</h4>

<p>To a suspension of KH (4.57 g of a 30% suspension in mineral oil, 32.9 mmol) was added
a solution of 4-bromo-indole (5.88g, 30.0 mmol) in anhydrous ether (25 ml). The reaction
was stirred at r.t. for 30 min under N<sub>2</sub> and the reaction was cooled in an acetone-dry ice
bath (-78�C) with stirring. Precooled <em>t-</em>BuLi solution in hexane (33.0 ml, 66.0 mmol) was
cannulated into the reaction and the reaction was kept stirring for another 20 min. Neat
B(<em>n</em>-BuO)<sub>3</sub> (24.1 ml, 90.0 mmol) was added into the reaction by syringe under vigorous
stirring. The reaction mixture became thick when it was allowed to warm to r.t., and more
anhydrous ether (30 ml) was added under N<sub>2</sub>. The reaction was allowed to stand
overnight at r.t. with vigorous stirring. The thick reaction mixture was diluted with more
anhydrous ether and then transferred slowly into 1 M aqueous H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (300 ml) at 0�C.
The mixture was stirred at r.t. for 40 min, and extracted with ether (<abbr title="Likely a typo, should be '3 x 100mL'">100 ml x 30</abbr>). The
combined organic layer was extracted with 1 N NaOH (50 ml x 3). Ether (100 ml) was
added to this aqueous solution and the mixture was acidified to pH = 2 using 1M H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.
The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ether (100 ml x
2). The combined ether layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporation of solvent in vacuo
left a beige solid (4.24g, 88.0%).</p>

<h4>7. 3-(4-indolyl)-pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (9a)</h4>

<p>Into 500 ml anhydrous toluene in a 1 liter round bottom flask equipped with stirring bar
was bubbled in a stream of argon via a needle for 30 min. Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (0.878g, 0.75 mmol)
and 3-chloro-pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (3.44g, 15.0 mmol) were
added into this solvent and the resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. under argon for 1 hour.
A solution of indole-4-boronic acid (1.86g, 11.5 mmol) in 50 ml EtOH and a solution of
2M aqueous Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (11.5 ml) was added into the reaction mixture at r.t. under argon.
The mixture was heated under argon with vigorous stirring at 105�C for 8 hours. The
reaction mixture was cooled and brine (200 ml) was added. The organic layer was
separated and aqueous layer extracted with additional CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2x100 ml). The
combined organic layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporation of the solvent left a
yellowish solid. Purification of the crude material through a short plug of silica gel
(hexane:ethyl acetate, 1:2) afforded a yellow solid. The TLC of this material showed it
to be a mixture of three different compounds due to ester exchange. This solid was
dissolved in 500 ml EtOH and the solution was stirred overnight at r.t. in the presence of
catalytic HCl in diethyl ether. A single compound (3.54g) was obtained (mp. 212.3-213.0&deg;C)
in 91.0% yield.</p>

<h4>8. 6-Hydroxymethyl-5-(4-indolyl)-nicotinic acid ethyl ester (9b)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 3-(4-indolyl)-pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (0.34g, 1.0
mmol) in anhydrous EtOH (10 ml) was added Ba(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (24.6mg, 0.65 mmol) followed
by CaCl<sub>2</sub> (44.3mg, 0.4 mmol) at 0�C. The reaction was warmed to r.t. and stirred for 2
hours. 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (1 ml) was added to the reaction, and the resulting white precipitation
(CaSO<sub>4</sub>) was filtered out through a plug of celite. The filtrate was concentrated and
partitioned between ethyl acetate (20 ml) and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (aq. 15 ml). The organic layer was
separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional ethyl acetate (2x20 ml).
The combined organic layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the solvent was removed. The
crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography using hexane-ethyl acetate (3:1
to 1:1). A colorless solid (mp. 198.1-199.0�C) was obtained (231 mg) in 78% yield.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the product could also be made using Ca(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as the reducing reagent in
the same solvent and temperature for same period of time. The NMR, mass spectrum,
elemental analysis and mp. of this product were identical to that of the product obtained
by the previous method. The yield of this reaction was 85%.</p>

<h4>9. 6-formyl-5-(4-indolyl)-nicotinic acid ethyl ester (9c)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 6-hydroxymethyl-5-(4-indolyl)-nicotinic acid ethyl ester (296 mg, 1.0
mmol) in 5 ml CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was added freshly made MnO<sub>2</sub> (870 mg, 10.0 mmol). The
reaction was stirred at r.t. for 2 hours then filtered from the solution through a plug of
celite, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. Purification of the crude material by silica
gel chromatography using hexane-ethyl acetate (2:1) afforded a yellow solid (271mg,
92%) with mp. 198.4-199.2�C.</p>

<h4>10. 6-Hydroxy-4,6-dihydro-indolo[<em>4,3-fg</em>]quinoline-9-carboxylic acid methyl ester (10)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 6-formyl-5-(4-indolyl)-nicotinic acid ethyl ester (117.8 mg, 0.4 mmol) in
anhydrous methanol (1.0 ml) in a 2 ml conical vial was added 0.5 M NaOMe/MeOH (
16.0 �l, 0.008 mmol). The reaction was stirred at r.t. for 2 hours. Solid precipitated out of
the solution during the course of the reaction, and the starting material disappeared
completely after 2 hours as indicated by TLC. The solution was cooled to 0�C and the
liquid was removed with a pipette. The remaining solid was recrystallized from MeOH to
afford 102.0 mg yellow crystalline solid (mp. 234.6-235.8�C) in 91% yield.</p>

<h4>11. 4,6-Dihydro-indolo[<em>4,3-fg</em>]quinoline-9-carboxylic acid methyl ester (11)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 6-hydroxy-4,6-dihydro-indolo[<em>4,3-fg</em>]quinoline-9-carboxylic methyl
ester (90 mg, 0.32mmol) in 10 ml anhydrous THF was added BH<sub>3</sub> in THF (1.0 M, 0.64
ml, 0.64mol) under argon. The resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. for 2 hours. The TLC
showed the disappearance of the starting material and a new fluorescent spot under UV
on TLC. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude material was partitioned
between CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (3 ml) and aq. NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (sat., 2 ml). The organic layer was separated and
the aqueous was extracted with additional CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2x3 ml). The combined organic
layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The crude material was purified by
silica gel PTLC using CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH (98:2). A white solid was obtained (mp. 212.9-213.9�C, 35.2 mg) in 41% yield.</p>

<h4>12. (�)-Lysergic acid (1)</h4>

<p>To a solution of 4,6-dihydro-indolo[<em>4,3-fg</em>]quinoline-9-carboxylic acid methyl ester
(29.2 mg, 0.116 mmol) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (1ml) was added MeI (33.0 mg, 14.6 �l, 0.24 mmol) at
0�C. The reaction was stirred at 0�C for 2 hours and the starting material disappeared
after 2 hours as indicated by TLC. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude
product was dissolved in methanol (1 ml). To that mixture was added NaBH<sub>4</sub> (15.2 mg,
0.4 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at r.t. for 5 min. The organic solvent was removed
in vacuo and the remaining solution was partitioned between CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2 ml) and water (2
ml). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (3 ml x 2). The organic layers were combined and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The
solvent was removed and the crude material was purified by PTLC (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH, 98:2). A white solid was obtained (21.4 mg, 65%). <sup>1</sup>H NMR showed it to be a mixture of
methyl lysergate and methyl isolysergate in 6:1 ratio using N-methyl as the integration indicator.</p>

<p>To a solution of methyl lysergate & methyl isolysergate (6:1 mixture above, 15.6 mg,
0.028 mmol) in ethanol (0.5 ml) was added 1 N NaOH (0.5 ml). The reaction was heated
at 35�C for two hours. 0.1 N HCl solution was used to carefully adjust the pH to 6 and the
solid material was collected by removing the liquid. The solid was recrystallized from
ethanol to afford 12.2 mg, (95%) of lysergic acid.</p>
