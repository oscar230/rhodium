<P>Although considerable efforts<SUP>1,2</SUP> have been devoted to the syntheses of psilocin<SUP>1</SUP> (<B>1</B>), psilocybin<SUP>1</SUP> (<B>2</B>), and their analogs, there still remains to establish structure-activity relationships. With a hope to find a lead compound among psilocin analogs possesing suitable pharmacological effects for psychotic diseases such as depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and so on, we have developed a novel five-step preparative method of <B>1</B> from indole-3-carbaldehyde (<B>3</B>).</P>

We have already reported one pot procedure<SUP>3</SUP> for preparing 4-benzyloxyindole-3-carbaldehyde (<B>4</B>) from <B>3</B>. The overall yield of <B>4</B>, however, did not exceed 58% and varied depending on the reaction conditions. The one pot procedure consists of three reactions: 1) regioselective thallation of the 4-position of <B>3</B>, 2) transformation of C-Tl bond to C-I bond, and 3) conversion of the C-I bond to C-OCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph bond.</P>


<P>We have attempted to improve the yield of <B>4</B> as well as the  reproducibility in order to utilize the one pot procedure as the  first step in the preparative method of <B>1</B>. Among the three  reactions involved, we thoroughly reexamined the third reaction of  4-iodoindole-3-carbaldehyde (<B>5</B>) with metal benzyloxide (20-26  mol eq) in the presence of CuI (3 mol eq) in DMF at  120<SUP>0</SUP>C.<SUP>3</SUP> Consequently, we found that not only  the preparation method of metal benzyloxide but also the metal itself  is an important factor for controlling the overall yield. Thus,  treatment of <B>5</B> with sodium benzyloxide (NaOCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph),  prepared from sodium and benzyl alcohol (PhCH<SUB>2</SUB>OH),  afforded <B>4</B> in 24% yield. When NaH was employed to produce  NaOCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph, the yield doubled to 48%. In contrast, when  potassium was used instead of sodium, further improvement in the  yield was observed (54%). Finally, KH was found to be the reagent of  choice and thereby the yield was raised up to 70%. Among the tested  solvents, DMF was found to give the best yield of <B>4</B>. Replacement of DMF by either HMPA or PhCH<SUB>2</SUB>OH dropped the  yield to 48 or 30%, respectively. We have further reconfirmed that  the suitable amount of KOCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph is 25 mol eq to the  starting material <B>3</B>.</P> 

 <P>The other important factor to keep reproducibility in the one pot  procedure was the relative ratio of iodination reagents  (I<SUB>2</SUB> and CuI) to KOCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph. Fixing the amount of  KOCH<SUB>2</SUB>Ph to about 25 mol eq, the ratio was examined  culminating in finding that 3.0 mol eq to <B>3</B> was the best  reaction conditions, where the desired <B>4</B> was produced in 72%  overall yield from <B>3</B> with an excellent reproducibility.</P> 


<P>As the second step in the preparative method of <B>1</B>, <B>4</B>  was transformed into 4-benzyloxyindole-3-acetonitrile (<B>6</B>) in  89% yield utilizing our reaction,<SUP>4</SUP> thus by treating  <B>4</B> with NaBH<SUB>4</SUB> in the presence of NaCN in MeOH and  formamide. Reduction of <B>6</B> with LiAlH<SUB>4</SUB> in  Et<SUB>2</SUB>O is the third step giving the known  4-benzyloxytryptamine<SUP>1a </SUP>(<B>7</B>) in 96% yield. Interestingly, when THF was used as a solvent instead of  Et<SUB>2</SUB>O, the yield of <B>7</B> decreased dramatically to the  range of 25 to 46%. As the fourth step, dimethylation of <B>7</B> was  carried out with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride<SUP>5</SUP>  in AcOH to produce <B>8</B><SUP>1c</SUP> in 97% yield. The final step  of debenzylation of <B>8</B> was the catalytic hydrogenation using  10% Pd/C producing psilocin<SUP>1d</SUP> (<B>1</B>) in 84% yield. Since <B>1</B> was converted to psilocybin (<B>2</B>) in two steps by  Hofman and co-workers,<SUP>1c</SUP> the present method constitutes a  seven-step synthesis of <B>2</B> as well.</P> 


<P>In conclusion, we could establish a novel five-step preparative  method of <B>1</B> in 50% overall yield and 50% originality  rate.<SUP>6</SUP> Utilizing <B>1</B> and its intermediates (<B>4</B>,  <B>6-8</B>), the syntheses of psilocin analogs and particularly the  compounds having substituents in the benzene part are in progress.  </P>
