<div class="stdtxt">

        <p>In a previous paper<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> it was demonstrated with <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine 
          that the introduction of a methyl group into the side chain of &beta;-phenylethylamine 
          furnishes a compound differing from the latter with regard to certain 
          of its effects when administered as a drug compound. The <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine 
          exerts a pressor effect for a longer period of time and is quite effective 
          after oral administration.</p>
        <p>The syntheses of the parent <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine and the desired 
          methoxy derivative are reported in this paper; the physiological studies 
          of the compounds prepared will be reported in another place.</p>
        <p>The synthesis of &beta;-phenylethylamines is often accomplished, especially 
          for proof of structure, by condensing an aromatic aldehyde with nitromethane 
          under suitable conditions and complete reduction of the beta-nitrostyrene 
          so formed, to the hydrogenated amine derivative. It was found that a 
          similar preparative process can be carried out with nitroethane in place 
          of nitromethane, the resultant product being a <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine.</p>
        <p>The initial condensation step in the process was found to be most simply 
          carried out by the method of Knoevenagel and Walther<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. The second 
          step, the complete reduction, involves considerable difficulty but the 
          described electrolytic reduction method gives fair yields of the desired 
          amines while
          several attempts at catalytic hydrogenation or reduction with various 
          metals or their amalgams were not at all successful.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>     
        <p>The details of preparation of the <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine and 
          its 4-methoxy derivative differ only in the aldehyde used and the intermediate 
          and final products isolated.</p>
		  <br>
        <h5>Condensation of Aldehyde and Nitroethane</h5>
        <p>0.2 Mole of aldehyde, 0.2 mole of nitroethane and 0.02 mole of <em>n</em>-amylamine 
          were mixed and set aside at room temperature in the dark. After a day 
          water began to separate from the mixture; after several days the mixture 
          became quite solid. After two weeks, the mixture was dissolved to a 
          homogeneous
          solution by warming with 50 ml of ethanol and then on cooling a fine 
          crystal product was obtained. From benzaldehyde, 0.15 mole of phenylnitropropylene 
          melting at 65-66�C was obtained. The melting point of this compound has 
          been reported as 64�C<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. From anisaldehyde, 0.15 mole of 4-methoxyphenylnitropropylene 
          melting at 43-44�C was obtained. The melting point of this compound has 
          been reported as 48�C<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
		  <br>
        <h5>Reduction of Phenylnitropropylenes</h5>
        <p>0.1 Mole of phenylnitropropylene dissolved in a catholyte of 100 ml 
          of ethanol, 50 ml of acetic acid and 50 ml of 12 N sulfuric acid was 
          placed above a 40 cm<sup>2</sup> mercury cathode in a porous cell surrounded by 
          a 3 N sulfuric acid anolyte with a water-cooled lead anode. Four amperes 
          was passed for twenty hours and the temperature in the catholyte was 
          kept between 30-40�C.</p>
        <p>The resultant catholyte was partially evaporated, then made strongly 
          alkaline and the separated basic layer taken up with benzene. The desired 
          amine was then extracted from the benzene by just neutralizing with 
          dilute hydrochloric acid and separating the aqueous layer. This was 
          then evaporated
          and the product crystallized. From phenylnitropropylene, 0.02 mole of 
          <em>dl</em>-&beta;-phenylisopropylamine hydrochloride melting at 144-145�C was obtained. 
          The melting point of this compound has been reported as 145-147�C<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. 
          From 4-methoxy-phenylnitropropylene, 0.02 mole of <em>dl</em>-&beta;-4-methoxyphenylisopropylamine 
          hydrochloride melting at 205-209�C was obtained. The melting point of
          this compound has bees reported as 210�C<a href="meth.alles.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
