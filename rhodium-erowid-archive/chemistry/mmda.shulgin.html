<p>The establishment of trimethoxyamphetamine (<strong>Ib</strong>, TMA) as being of greater psychotropic potency than either a-ethyl mescaline (<strong>Ic</strong>)<a href="mmda.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> or mescaline itself (<strong>Ia</strong>)<a href="mmda.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> has led to the examination of analogues which retain the three carbon chain but vary in 
other areas of the molecule. The presence of elemicin (3,4,5-trimethoxy allylbenzene) in the aromatic ether fraction of oil of nutmeg<a href="mmda.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
and the proposal of a possible in vivo mechanism of its conversion to TMA<a href="mmda.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> have afforded an explanation of the psychotropic 
action<a href="mmda.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> of nutmeg. The substance myristicin (<strong>II</strong>) is the major component of this fraction, and if it were to undergo the transformation 
parallel to that proposed for elemicin, a second amphetamine, 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy amphetamine (MMDA, <strong>IVa</strong>), would result.</p>

<p>This latter amphetamine has been synthesized from myristicin in vitro, by a three-step process. <em>trans</em>-Isomyristicin, obtained from 
myristicin by heating in alcoholic potassium hydroxide, is converted by means of tetranitromethane to ß-nitro isomyristicin. Reduction 
of this nitropropene with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> led smoothly to MMDA, which was isolated as the hydrochloride. Examination of MMDA in mice and dogs 
displayed a behavioural and toxicological pattern similar to that of TMA, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Preliminary human 
evaluation revealed initial intoxication at about 1.0 mg/kg (as free base). More extensive assay has confirmed a thoroughly effective 
hypnogogic dementia at less than 2.0 mg/kg. The psychotomimetic syndrome was complete at this level: increased dosages (to 3.2 mg/kg) 
merely prolonged the duration of the episode. Thus the potency of MMDA is somewhat greater than TMA and nearly three times greater 
than mescaline.</p>

<p>Substitution of either an ethylenedioxy or a trimethylenedioxy group for the methylenedioxy moiety (compounds <strong>IVb</strong> and <strong>IVc</strong>) resulted 
in a marked decrease in psychotropic effectiveness. These amphetamines were prepared from the aldehydes <strong>IIIb</strong> and <strong>IIIc</strong> by condensation 
with nitroethane followed by reaction with LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. A prohibitively small yield of the ethylidine analogue <strong>IIId</strong> precluded further 
synthetic efforts.</p>

<p>As with TMA, the effects of MMDA are hallucinogenic and permit complete recall. They will be reported shortly, in full, with 
appropriate synthetic detail.</p>
