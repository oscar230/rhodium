<h3>Preparation of high-active copper chromite dehydrogenation catalyst</h3>

<p>A solution of 260 g of Copper(II)nitrate trihydrate in 900 ccm of tap water at 80�C was added while stirring to a soln 178 g of sodium dichromate dihydrate 
and 225 ml of 28% NH4OH made up to 900 ml at 25�C. The precipitate was collected by suction filtration and slurried in water three times. The copper ammonium
chromate was dried at 75-80C overnight. This was powdered and added in small portions to a one liter 3-neck flask equipped with a stainless steel stirrer
Hershberg type which scrapped close to the bottom of the flask. The flask was partially immersed in a Woods-alloy metal bath at 350�C (with 300-320�C, one can
obtain good results). The time of addition was 15 min (a lot of fumes evolved) and the mixture was stirred at 350�C for another 15 min after all was complete.
The cooled and black dusty powder used as is for the dehydrogenation.</p>
