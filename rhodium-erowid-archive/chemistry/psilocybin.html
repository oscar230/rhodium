<h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>An improved procedure to accomplish the O-phosphorylation of 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-
      tryptamine (Psilocin, <strong>5</strong>) is reported that utilizes reaction
      between the O-lithium salt of psilocybin and tetra-O-benzylpyrophosphate.
      The O-benzyl groups were removed by catalytic hydrogenation over palladium
      on carbon to afford N,N-dimethyl-4- phosphoryloxytryptamine (Psilocybin,
      <strong>1</strong>). In view of difficulties encountered in the preparation
      of<strong> 1</strong>, it is suggested that 4-acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
      (<strong>2</strong>) may be a useful alternative for pharmacological studies.
      The latter was obtained following catalytic O-debenzylation of 4-benzyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
      in the presence of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate.</p>
</div>

  <p>Recently, several laboratories have initiated clinical studies of hallucinogenic
    (psychedelic) agents<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>1-3</sup></a>. This renewed interest
    suggests that there may be some demand for investigational substances that
    are suitably pure for human use that can be prepared in a relatively economical
    fashion. Hallucinogens are not commercially available in large quantities
    or in purities suitable for human studies, and research will likely be carried
    out only with drugs produced by custom synthesis. Of the various drugs that
    might be of interest for this work, most of them, including mescaline, LSD,
    DMT, and various substituted amphetamines are synthesized relatively easily.
    Indeed, many hallucinogens are routinely manufactured in clandestine laboratories.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the synthesis of psilocybin, N,N-dimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine
    (<strong>1</strong>), is more challenging. Nevertheless, psilocybin has pharmacological
    features that make it attractive for clinical research, including a relatively
    short duration of action. The increasing worldwide popularity of psilocybin-containing
    mushrooms as recreational drugs also points to the need for more research
    with psilocybin. We re-examined the synthesis of psilocybin reported by Hofmann
    and coworkers<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. Although their approach still
    remains useful, there were several weak points that could be addressed to
    improve the yields and purities of the final compound.</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/psiloscheme0.gif">
</div>

  <p>The overall synthetic route is shown in <em>Scheme 1</em>. The most troublesome
    step is the last, the phosphorylation of psilocin. In the original synthesis
    by Hofmann et al.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> the phosphorylation step
    was accomplished using O,O-dibenzylphosphorylchloride, an unstable reagent
    that was used without purification as a solution in carbon tetrachloride.
    Furthermore, the final yield of psilocybin was less than 20%. In view of the
    overall difficulty in preparing this material and its precursors, such a low
    yield in the last step was deemed unacceptable.</p>

  <p>The present synthesis employs a phosphorylation step using tetrabenzylpyrophosphate,
    a stable, crystalline reagent. The phosphorylation step was complicated by
    the previously unreported <em>extremely</em> labile nature of the O,O-dibenzyl
    ester of psilocybin. Hydrolytic cleavage of one of the O-benzyl groups occurred
    rapidly in the presence of water, at room temperature, and neutral pH. The
    purification of the resulting zwitterionic material was much more complicated
    than for the basic O,O-dibenzyl material.</p>

<div class="pic">
<h3>Scheme 1</h3>
<img src="pictures/psiloscheme1.gif">
</div>

  <p>Illustrated in<em> Scheme 2</em> is the facile preparation of 4-acetoxy-DMT<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a><strong>2</strong>.
    This O-acetyl prodrug of psilocin is much more easily prepared than psilocybin,
    and may offer an economical alternative for clinicians wishing to study the
    psychopharmacology of psilocin. This material is readily crystallized as the
    fumarate salt, and is considerably more stable than psilocin itself. It would
    seem to be an ideal prodrug to replace psilocybin in future clinical studies,
    since psilocin is the principal metabolite of psilocybin.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<div class="pic right">
<h3>Scheme 2</h3>
<img src="pictures/psiloscheme2.gif">
</div>

  <p>The classical Speeter and Anthony synthesis of tryptamines from indoles served
    as the precedent for this work.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>7 </sup></a>The key reaction
    of oxalyl chloride with 4-benzyloxyindole was, however, sluggish. Similarly,
    the reduction of the 4-substituted glyoxalylamide <strong>3</strong> was much
    slower than for indoles without substitution at this position. TLC was used
    to monitor the complete disappearance of starting material and intermediate
    reduction products. The O-benzyl group was then readily removed by catalytic
    hydrogenolysis to afford 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (psilocin; <strong>5</strong>).</p>

  <p>After experimentation with a variety of phosphorylating agents, it was finally
    decided that tetrabenzylpyrophosphate (TBPP) was the most suitable reagent.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>
    This crystalline and stable material is commercially available (Aldrich),
    but can also be synthesized readily on a multigram scale.</p>

  <p>The most convenient base for the phosphorylation step proved to be butyllithium.
    Generation of the lithium salt of psilocin in THF at -70 °C, followed by addition
    of 1.1 equivalents of TBPP, led to the O,O-dibenzyl ester of psilocybin, with
    the generation of one equivalent of lithium O,O-dibenzylphosphate that must
    ultimately be removed. While ordinarily removal of the lithium salt would
    not be problematic, washing the organic reaction mixture with water led to
    unexpected and rapid hydrolysis of one of the O-benzyl groups. Judicious exclusion
    of traces of water allowed the isolation of O,O-dibenzyl ester that was nearly
    free of <strong>6</strong>. The O,O-dibenzyl intermediate proved to be so
    sensitive to water, however, that it was more practical to use an aqueous
    workup, allow hydrolysis to occur, and isolate a product that was largely
    the zwitterionic O-monobenzylphosphate <strong>6</strong>.</p>

  <p>Catalytic hydrogenolysis of the crude O-benzyl ester led to the formation
    of psilocybin (<strong>1</strong>). The procedure was complicated by small
    amounts of phosphoric acid generated from residual dibenzylphosphoric acid
    carried from the previous step into the hydrogenolysis reaction. This highly
    acidic material leads to discoloration of the product and prevents satisfactory
    crystallization. The problem was solved through the use of anion exchange
    resin to titrate the phosphoric acid. The reported pH of a solution of psilocybin
    in 50% aqueous ethanol is 5.2.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> Anion exchange
    resin (OH<sup>-</sup> form) was added in portions, with vigorous and extended
    stirring, to the filtered reaction solution until the pH of the solution was
    5.2.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> When this pH was reached, the resin was
    removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The
    crude product was then recrystallized from a small amount of methanol, and
    a large volume of isopropanol, followed by storage in the freezer. Psilocybin
    (<strong>1</strong>) crystallized as long colorless needles.</p>

  <p>As a potential replacement for (<strong>1</strong>), 4-Acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
    fumarate (<strong>2</strong>) was conveniently prepared by shaking under hydrogen
    a mixture of <strong>4</strong>, acetic anhydride, and sodium acetate in benzene
    with Pd/C in a Parr low pressure hydrogenation apparatus. Following uptake
    of the required amount of hydrogen corresponding to O-debenzylation, the catalyst
    and insoluble salts were removed by filtration. One molar equivalent of fumaric
    acid was added to the filtrate, and the solution was concentrated to dryness
    under vacuum. The resulting solid was recrystallized to afford white crystals
    of the desired product. This material was stable when stored in the cold,
    but slowly darkened on storage for several months at ambient temperature.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>4-Benzyloxyindol-3-yl-N,N-dimethylglyoxylamide (3)</h4>

    <p>A solution of 4-benzyloxyindole (17.5 g, 0.078 mol) (Biosynth) in anhyd
      Et<sub>2</sub>O (500 mL) was mechanically stirred in a 1 L, 3 necked flask
      and cooled in an ice-salt bath to an internal temperature of 0°C. Oxalyl
      chloride (20.3 g, 0.16 moles) was added dropwise at a rate that maintained
      an internal temperature between 0-5°C. Stirring was continued for 3 h at
      a temperature between 5-10°C with a gentle argon sparge to remove evolved
      HCl. The argon sparge was replaced by a gas inlet tube and a dry ice/acetone
      condenser. Anhyd dimethylamine was then bubbled into the reaction with cooling
      and vigorous stirring until a pH (determined by moist pH paper) between
      9 and 11 was achieved. At this time, the orange color of the initial solution
      had been mostly discharged, and the reaction had the appearance of a slightly
      off-white slurry with a few flecks of yellow unreacted starting material.
      CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (20 mL) was added to assist solubilization
      of the unreacted material and the reaction was stirred for an additional
      6 h to yield finally an offwhite slurry. Et<sub>2</sub>O (150 mL) was added,
      and the mixture was cooled to 10°C. The white solids were collected by suction
      filtration on filter paper in a Buchner funnel and then were suspended in
      distilled H<sub>2</sub>O (250 mL) and stirred for 1 h to remove dimethylamine
      hydrochloride. The slurry was filtered, and the collected solids were washed
      on the filter with distilled H<sub>2</sub>O (3 x 75 mL) and hexane (75 mL)
      and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. The dried product weighed 18.3 g.
      The organic filtrates and washes were combined and the solvent was removed
      by rotary evaporation. The residue was dissolved in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>
      (100 mL) and the organic solution was washed with distilled H<sub>2</sub>O
      (2 x 50 mL) and brine (2 x 50 mL). After drying (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) the volume
      was reduced by rotary evaporation. The concentrated residual solution was
      subjected to flash chromatography over silica gel, first eluting with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>
      to recover unreacted indole (1.3 g, 7.4%), followed by elution with 10%
      MeOH in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> to recover 3.3 g of <strong>3</strong>.
      The latter was combined with the initial product to provide a total weight
      of 21.6 g (85.9%). The crude product was recrystallized from MeOH/EtOAc
      to give 19.5 g (77%) of <strong>3</strong> with mp 152-155 °C (Lit.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>
      mp 146-150 °C).</p>

<h4>4-Benzyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4)</h4>

    <p>A slurry of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> (8.90 g, 0.234 mol) in anhyd THF (100 mL)
      was prepared in a 2 L, 3-neck flask, previously dried with a heat gun under
      an argon purge. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser, mechanical
      stirrer, and addition funnel. Anhyd dioxane (200 mL) was added, and the
      mixture was heated to 60°C on an oil bath. 4-benzyloxyindol-3-yl-N,N-dimethylglyoxylamide
      (<strong>3</strong>) (14.5 g, 0.045 moles) was dissolved in a mixture of
      dioxane (250 mL) and THF (150 mL) and, with rapid stirring, this solution
      was added dropwise over 1 h. The oil bath temperature was held at 70°C for
      4 h, followed by vigorous reflux overnight (16 h) at an oil bath temperature
      of 95°C. Thin layer chromatographic analysis (9:1 CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/MeOH
      silica plates) showed nearly complete reduction. The reaction was heated
      at reflux for an additional 4 h and then cooled to 20 °C. A solution of
      distilled H<sub>2</sub>O (27 mL) in THF (100 mL) was added dropwise, resulting
      in a gray flocculent precipitate. Et<sub>2</sub>O (250 mL) was added to
      assist breakup of the complex and improve filtration. This slurry was stirred
      for 1 h and the mixture was then filtered with a Buchner funnel. The filter
      cake was washed on the filter with warm Et<sub>2</sub>O (2 x 250 mL) and
      was broken up, transferred back into the reaction flask and vigorously stirred
      with additional hot Et<sub>2</sub>O (500 mL). This slurry was filtered,
      and the cake was washed on the filter with Et<sub>2</sub>O (150 mL) and
      hexane (2 x 150 mL). All of the organic filtrates were combined and dried
      (MgSO<sub>4</sub>). After the drying agent was removed by filtration, the
      filtrate was concentrated under vacuum at 40°C and dried under high vacuum
      at 0.01 mmHg, leading to crystallization of the residue as a white waxy
      solid. Recrystallization from EtOAc yielded 12.57 g, (94.8%) of <strong>4</strong>
      with mp 124-126 °C (lit.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> mp 125-126 °C).</p>

<h4>4-Hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (Psilocin, 5)</h4>

    <p>A solution of 4 (4.0 g, 0.0135 moles) in 95% EtOH (250 mL) was added to
      1.5 g Pd/C (10% w/w) in a 500 mL Parr low pressure hydrogenation bottle.
      The mixture was shaken under 60 psig of H<sub>2</sub> pressure for 2 h.
      The catalyst was removed by vacuum filtration through Celite and was washed
      on the filter with EtOH (3 x 50 mL). The filtrate was concentrated by rotary
      evaporation. The clear residual oil was placed under high vacuum and induced
      to crystallize by seeding. The white crystalline powder (2.68 g, 97.0%)
      was used in the next step without further purification.</p>

<h4>4-O-Monobenzylphosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (<strong>6</strong>)</h4>

    <p>A solution of 0.45 g (2.2 mmol) of psilocin (<strong>5</strong>) and 0.073
      g (0.73 mmol) of diisopropylamine in anhyd THF (50 mL) was magnetically
      stirred in a 100 mL 3-necked flask and was cooled to -78 °C in a dry ice-acetone
      bath. A 2.5 M solution (1.14 mL, 2.85 mmol) of <em>n</em>-BuLi in hexane
      was added dropwise using a syringe. After complete addition, the reaction
      was stirred for 3 min and tetrabenzylpyrophosphate<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>
      (1.50 g, 2.8 mmol) was added all at once. The dry ice-acetone bath was replaced
      by an ice-salt bath, and stirring was continued for 1.5 h. TLC (9:1 CHCl<sub>3</sub>-MeOH
      alumina plates) showed complete disappearance of starting material. The
      reaction was quenched by addition of sat. NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (30 mL). The
      biphasic solution was rapidly transferred to a separatory funnel, and the
      aqueous layer was separated and washed with EtOAc (2 x 20 mL). The organic
      layers were combined and washed with brine (25 mL), followed by drying (anhyd
      MgSO<sub>4</sub>). The solution was then concentrated to a clear residue
      using rotary evaporation. This residue (1.12 g) was shown by thin layer
      chromatography and NMR analysis to be a mixture of O,O-dibenzylpsilocybin,
      O-monobenzylpsilocybin (<strong>6</strong>), and a small amount of dibenzyl
      phosphoric acid.</p>

<h4>N,N-Dimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine (Psilocybin; <strong>1</strong>)</h4>

    <p>In a 250 mL Parr hydrogenation bottle was placed 1.0 g of 10% Pd/C catalyst
      followed by anhyd MeOH (50 mL). The dibenzyl/monobenzylphosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
      (1.12 g) prepared in the previous step was added and the mixture was shaken
      under 60 psig hydrogen pressure for 3 h, at which time hydrogen uptake had
      ceased. The hydrogenation bottle was removed from the apparatus and the
      catalyst was removed by filtration through a pad of Celite 545 on a Buchner
      funnel. The pH of the clear solution was measured at 3.7 using a pH meter.
      Amberlite IRA-400 anion exchange resin (OH<sup>-</sup> form) (0.75&nbsp;g)
      was added in 3 portions to the well-stirred methanolic solution to raise
      the pH to 5.3.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> The resin was removed by vacuum
      filtration and the resulting clear filtrate was concentrated to dryness
      by rotary evaporation. The residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of
      hot MeOH, and hot isopropanol was added to the cloud point. An additional
      drop of MeOH produced a clear solution. Upon storage in a -20°C freezer
      the product slowly crystallized as white needles 0.294&nbsp;g (46.9%, from
      psilocin). This product was dried under high vacuum to produce solvent-free
      psilocybin, which had mp 212-213°C (lit.<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> mp 210-212 °C).</p>

    <h4>4-Acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine<a href="psilocybin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> fumarate (<strong>2</strong>)</h4>

    <p>In a 250 mL Parr hydrogenation bottle was placed 0.25&nbsp;g of
      10% palladium on charcoal followed by anhyd sodium acetate (1.50&nbsp;g,
      18 mmol). Benzene (50 mL) was added, followed by acetic anhydride
      (5 mL, 5.41 g, 5.32 mmol), and <strong>4</strong> (0.50&nbsp;g,
      1.7&nbsp;mmol). The mixture was shaken under 60 psig of hydrogen for
      4 h. After the uptake of hydrogen had ceased the hydrogenation bottle was
      removed from the apparatus, the mixture was diluted with THF (25 mL), and
      the catalyst was removed by filtration through a pad of Celite 545. The
      catalyst was washed repeatedly with isopropanol (3 x 50 mL). The
      washings and mother liquor were collected separately because of unreacted
      Ac2O in the filtrate. The mother liquor was concentrated under vacuum
      to about one half the original volume, then toluene (50 mL) was added. The
      solution was again concentrated by rotary evaporation. The isopropanol washes
      were combined with the residue and also concentrated. The residue was then
      dissolved in anhyd MeOH (50 mL). Fumaric acid (0.198 g, 1.7 mmol) was dissolved
      in MeOH (10 mL) and added to the stirred methanolic solution of the residue.
      After stirring for 10 minutes, toluene (50 mL) was added and the solution
      was concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation. Absolute EtOH was added
      to the residue and a white precipitate of <strong>2</strong> fumarate (0.290
      g, 0.8 mmol) formed and was collected by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated
      and the residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of MeOH. EtOAc was added
      and clear crystals began to form. After storing the solution in a freezer
      at -10°C, 0.170 g of additional product was collected for a total yield
      of 0.460 g (74.8%); mp 172-173°C.</p>
