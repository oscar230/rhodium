<h2>Bromination of 2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde</h2>
<h4>Organic Preparations and Proceedings International 23(4), 419-424 (1991)</h4>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt">
  <p>In the course of preparation of a key intermediate for the synthesis of certain
    anthracycline analogs, we were in need of 6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde
    (<strong>3</strong>). Rubenstein reported <strong>3</strong> as the exclusive
    product of the bromination of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>1</strong>)
    with bromine in acetic acid<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. This assumption
    was apparently based on the finding<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>*</sup></a> that nitration
    of <strong>1</strong> gave the 6-nitro and 4-nitro isomers in 80% and 20%
    yields, respectively. </p>
  <p>Later, an isomer of <strong>3</strong>, namely 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy�benzaldehyde
    (<strong>2</strong>), was obtained from <strong>1</strong> utilizing anhydrous
    stannous chloride and bromine in methylene chloride<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>,
    since it was believed that <strong>2</strong> was unknown in the literature.
    Notably, Bortnik et al.<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> showed that the structure
    of the product of the bromination of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>1</strong>)
    obtained by Rubenstein was actually <strong>2</strong>. These authors further
    established the identity of this substance by comparing it with the aldehyde
    <strong>2</strong> obtained in the formylation of the dimethyl ether of bromohydroquinone
    with hydrogen cyanide and aluminum chloride. </p>

  <div class="pic right">
  <img src="pictures/25-dmb.bromination.gif" border="0">
  </div>

  <p>Furthermore, the aldehyde <strong>2</strong> was oxidized to the corresponding
    known acid and the structures confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectral analysis.
    Although the original incorrect assignment of the structure reported by Rubenstein<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>
    has since been corrected by several investigators<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>2-5</sup></a>,
    the regioisomer <strong>3</strong> was never identified from the reaction
    of <strong>1</strong> with bromine in acetic acid. We have repeated the bromination
    of <strong>1</strong> as described by Rubenstein and now report our findings.</p>

  <p>The action of bromine on 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>1</strong>) in
    glacial acetic acid at room temperature afforded a mixture of two crystalline
    products, differing slightly in polarity, as indicated by thin layer chromatographic
    analysis. The separation of this mixture was achieved by fractional recrystallization
    (95% ethanol) and column chromatography to obtain <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>.
    The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 3 displayed an AB pattern for two protons
    in the aromatic region (&delta; = 7.00 ppm, dd, J = 9 Hz). The desired product <strong>3</strong>,
    was obtained in only 5% yield in contrast to<strong> 2</strong> which comprised
    the major portion (87%) of the reaction product. The structure <strong>2</strong>
    was assigned based on <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral analysis and comparison with
    literature data<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a>. Final proof of the position
    of the bromine atom in the regioisomers <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>
    came from the subsequent synthesis of 3,6-dimethoxybenzocyclobutene (<strong>9</strong>)
    via Parham cyclialkylation<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> of <strong>8</strong>
    (Scheme 1). Thus, the treatment of <strong>3</strong> with triphenyl� methoxymethylphosphonium
    chloride in the presence of sodium ethoxide in ethanol<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>
    at 65�C resulted in a mixture of products. Among the products isolated were
    <em>trans</em>-6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-&beta;�methoxystyrene (<strong>4</strong>)
    (64%)<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>, mp 66-67�C, and its <em>cis</em> isomer
    <strong>5</strong> (4%), <strong>8</strong> mp 92-95�C, and 2-bromo-3,6�dimethoxyphenylacetaldehyde
    (6) along with a trace of unreacted 3. The structural assignment for <em>trans</em>
    and <em>cis</em> compounds was made on the basis of coupling constant values
    exhibited by the olefinic protons (J <em>trans</em> = 13 Hz vs. J <em>cis</em> = 6 Hz). </p>

  <div class="pic left">

  </div>

  <p>Hydrolysis of the <em>E-Z</em> mixture (4,5) with 70% perchloric acid in
    tetrahydrofuran<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>9,10</sup></a> at room temperature furnished
    <strong>6</strong> in 98% yield. Reduction of the aldehyde <strong>6</strong>
    with sodium borohydride in 95% ethanol at 50�C afforded the alcohol <strong>7</strong>
    (86%). Conversion of the bromo alcohol <strong>7</strong> to the corresponding
    bromide <strong>8</strong> (62%) was effected utilizing tri-n-octylphosphine
    and carbon tetrabromide<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> or triphenylphosphine
    dibromide<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a>. Finally, lithium halogen exchange
    of <strong>8</strong> with n-butyllithium in dry tetrahydrofuran (-105�C to
    -95�C), followed by intramolecular cyclization upon warming, provided the
    benzocyclobutene <strong>9</strong> (Scheme 1)<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>.
    A similar synthetic sequence starting from the bromo isomer <strong>2</strong>
    resulted only in the isolation of the dehalogenated end products, as would
    be expected, upon attempted cyclization of <strong>10</strong>, mp 75-76�C
    (EtOH)<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>. Only the regioisomer <strong>8</strong>
    with bromine atom ortho to the bromoalkyl side chain would readily undergo
    intramolecular cyclization, following the reaction conditions used, to form
    the cyclic product <strong>9</strong>.</p>

  <p>Thus, it is further confirmed that the structure of the minor product of
    the bromination of <strong>1</strong>, following the method reported by Rubenstein<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>,
    is <strong>3</strong>, while the major product<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>2-5</sup></a>
    is indeed <strong>2</strong>. To our knowledge, the minor isomer <strong>3</strong>,
    isolated from the reaction mixture, is reported here for the first time.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Bromination of 2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde</h4>

    <p>A cold solution of 20.0 g (0.12 mol) of 2,5�dimethoxybenzaldehyde in glacial
      acetic acid (115 mL) was treated with 20.0 g of bromine in glacial acetic
      acid (60 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2-3 days
      and diluted with ice water. The yellow precipitate was collected by filtration
      and dried (28 g, 95%), mp. 118-126�C (lit.<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>
      mp 125-126�C). Recrystallization from ethanol gave 15.20 g of <strong>2</strong>,
      mp 132-133�C (lit.<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a> mp 132-133�C). Ethanol
      was removed from the mother liquor in vacuo and the residue was subjected
      to column chromatography (silica gel, benzene). The solid (10.4 g) collected
      in initial fractions was 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>2</strong>),
      total yield 25.6g (87%), mp 132-133�C. Subsequent fractions gave 1.5g (5%)
      of 6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>3</strong>), mp 102-103�C
      (EtOH).</p>

    <h4>6-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-methoxystyrenes (4,5)</h4>

    <p>To a solution of sodium ethoxide (prepared from 0.15 g, 6.61 mmol of sodium
      in 10 mL of absolute ethanol) was added 1.78 g (5.19 mmol) of triphenylmethoxymethylphosphonium
      chloride<a href="bromodimethoxybenzaldehyde.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. The mixture was stirred at room
      temperature for fifteen minutes. To this mixture was added 1.27 g (5.18
      mmol) of 6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (<strong>3</strong>) in portions.
      The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for ten minutes followed
      by 24 hrs at 65�C in an argon atmosphere. After cooling, the reaction mixture
      was poured over ice water and repeatedly extracted with ether. The ether

      extract was washed with water and dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).
      Removal of the solvent gave a yellow viscous oil which was chromatographed
      (silica, benzene). Initial fractions contained some triphenylphosphine.
      Subsequent fractions gave <em>trans</em>-6�bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-&beta;-methoxystyrene
      (<strong>4</strong>), (0.92g; 64%), mp 66-67�C. <em>cis</em>-6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-&beta;-methoxystyrene
      (<strong>5</strong>), (0.060 g, 4%), mp 92-95�C. &beta;-(6-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)acetaldehyde
      (<strong>6</strong>), (0.12 g, 9%) (analytical data similar to the structure
      described below). In addition, a trace amount of unreacted aldehyde <strong>3</strong>
      (10 mg), triphenylphosphine and triphenylphosphineoxide were isolated. Due
      to apparent instability during recrystallization, the stereoisomers <strong>4</strong>
      and <strong>5</strong> were hydrolyzed to <strong>6</strong> which was characterized
      as its 2,4�dinitrophenylhydrazone.</p>

    <h4>beta-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (6).</h4>

    <p>The E-Z mixture (<strong>4</strong>,<strong>5</strong>) (0.7 g, 2.56 mmol)
      in tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) was treated with 6 mL of 70% perchloric acid.
      After stirring at room temperature for twenty minutes, the solution was
      poured over crushed ice and extracted with ether. The ether layer was washed
      with water and dried (MgSO4). Removal of the solvent gave a pale yellow
      solid (0.65 g, 98%), mp 67-69�C. It was analyzed as its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, mp 195-196�C (EtOH-EtOAc).</p>

    <h4>beta-(6-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol (7)</h4>

    <p>A solution of <strong>6</strong> (600 mg, 2.32 mmol) in 40 mL of 95% ethanol
      at 50�C was treated with sodium borohydride (40 mg). The reaction mixture
      was stirred at room temperature for forty-five minutes. The solvent was
      removed in vacuo and the residue was treated with hydrochloric acid (10%)
      and extracted with ether. The ether layer was washed successively with water,
      sodium bisulfite (10%), sodium carbonate (10%), and dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>).
      Removal of the solvent gave a white solid (0.52 g, 86%), mp 112-113�C (benzene-hexane).</p>

    <h4>beta-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenydiethyl bromide (8)</h4>

    <p>A solution of bromoalcohol <strong>7</strong> (86 mg, 0.33 mmol) in dry
      carbon tetrachloride (3 mL) was added dropwise to a suspension of triphenylphosphine
      dibromide (prepared from 250 mg of triphenylphosphine and 160 mg of bromine
      in 10 mL of carbon tetrachloride). The mixture was stirred for one hour
      at room temperature and then refluxed for seven hours in an inert atmosphere.
      After cooling, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated
      in vacuo. The residue was chromatographed (silica, 50% heptane in chloroform)
      to obtain the dibromide <strong>8</strong> (66 mg, 62%), mp 68-69�C (hexane).</p>

<h4>3,6-Dimethoxybenzocyclobutene (9)</h4>

    <p>In a 10 mL three-neck flask compound <strong>8</strong> (0.194 g , 0.60
      mmol) was dissolved in tezrahydrofuran (5 mL, dry, freshly distilled) and
      hexane (1 mL, dry) in an argon atmosphere. The solution was cooled (-95�C
      to -105�C). To this solution was added n-butyllithium (0.45 mL, 1.55M in
      hexane) at such a rate that the internal temperature did not exceed -95�C
      After stirring for one-half hour (-100�C to -105�C), the reaction mixture
      was warmed to room temperature and poured into ice water and extracted with
      ether. The ether layer was washed with water and dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>).
      The residue, obtained after evaporation of the solvent, was subjected to
      preparative layer chromatography (silica gel, 50% heptane in chloroform).
      The band at Rf 0.4 gave <strong>9</strong> (0.064 g, 65%); mp 59-60�C (EtOH-H<sub>2</sub>0).</p>
