<p>This article is a kind of supplement to PIHKAL, since its covers the syntheses of some fluoro- and nitro analogs of
2,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal158.html">(TMA-2, Pihkal #158)</a>
and 2-Methoxy-4,5-Methylenedioxyamphetamine <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal133.html">(MMDA-2, Pihkal (#133)</a>.</p>

<h4>2-Nitro-4,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (6-Nitro-3,4-DMA)</h4>

</div>

  <p>A solution of 3,4-Dimethoxyamphetamine (<a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal055.html">3,4-DMA</a>) 
    (1.95 g, 10 mmol) in 2N HNO<sub>3</sub> (10 mL) was added with stirring at 
    15�C to 30 mL conc. HNO<sub>3</sub> (70%, 1.42 g/mL) diluted with water (12 
    mL). The solution was stirred for 3 h at RT, then poured into ice-water. The 
    precipitate was suspended in 0.1 M NaOH, the solution extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 
    the extracts dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and the solvent evaporated. 
    The residue was dissolved in toluene and dry HCl gas was bubbled through it 
    to give 1.9 g (69%) of 6-Nitro-3,4-DMA&middot;HCl.</p>

<h4>2-Nitro-4,5-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (6-Nitro-MDA)</h4>

  <p>Prepared in a similar way as described above, using 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine 
    (<a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal100.html">MDA</a>). 
    Yield ca 80%.</p>

  <h4>5-Fluoro-2,4-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde</h4>

<p>Phosphorus oxychloride (15.3 g, 0.1 mol) and N-methyl-formanilide (13.5 g, 0.1 mol) was stirred for 30 minutes
at 25�C. Add slowly 2,4-dimethoxyfluorobenzene (15.6 g, 0.1 mol). After addition is complete, let react for 3 hours
at 35�C, leave overnight and pour in ice-water. Filter precipitate and dry to give 17.7 g of the benzaldehyde (96% yield)</p>

  <h4>1-(5-fluoro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene</h4>

<p>A mixture of 2-fluoro-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (4 g, 0.02 mol) and ammonium acetate (0.38 g, 5 mmol) in
nitroethane (21 mL) was heated for 3 hrs at 80�C. Excess solvent was evaporated and the oily residue scratched
with cold EtOH to precipitate the nitropropene (3.6 g, 69% yield)</p>

<h4>5-Fluoro-2,4-Dimethoxyamphetamine (5-F-2,4-DMA)</h4>

<p>To a suspension of LAH (0.8 g, 0.02 mol) in dry THF (10 mL) was added with stirring a solution of the above
nitropropene (1 g, 4.1 mmol) in dry THF (15 mL). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 3 hrs. It was then
cooled and excees LAH was decomposed by adding water. After filtration and washing the inorganic precipitate
with Et<sub>2</sub>O, combined extracts were evaporated and the oily residue redissolved in 0.1 N
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Wash with ether, basify and extract with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Evaporate
the solvent and convert the free base to its hydrochloride salt by bubbling dry HCl gas through an ethereal solution of the
base to get 0.6 g (58% yield) of the isopropylamine.</p>
