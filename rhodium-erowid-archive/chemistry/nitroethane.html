Nitroethane synthesis: a compilation

</p>

<p>

<b>Method 1:</b>    from sodium ethyl sulfate and a metal nitrite

</p>

<p>

1.5 mole sodium nitrite (103.5g) is intimately mixed with 1 mole of sodium ethyl sulfate (158g) and 0.0625 moles of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (8.6g).   The mixture is then heated to 125-130�C, at which temperature the nitroethane distills over as soon as it is formed.   The heating is discontinued when the distillation flow slackens considerably, and the crude nitroethane is washed with an equal amount of water, dried over CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and if needed, decolorized with a little activated carbon.   The nitroethane is then re-distilled, collecting the fraction between 114-116�C.   Yield 46% of theory

</p>

</p>

<p>

<b>Method 2:</b>    from diethyl sulfate and sodium nitrite

</p>

<p>

Initial run - Into a stoppered bottle was placed a mixture of diethyl sulfate (120g) and sodium nitrite solution (120g in 160ml of water.) The bottle was shaken mechanically for 20 hours, the pressure being released at intervals.   The contents were then poured into a separating funnel, and the upper layer separated, dried over calcium chloride. and distilled at 14 mmHg, the distillate up to 60�C being collected (the residue, ca.   230g., consisted of ethyl sulphate and was used again).   The distillate was fractionated at atmospheric pressure, and the fraction of bp 114-116�C collected.   This was shaken with water, dried over calcium chloride, run through charcoal, and redistilled; bp 114-115.5�C.   Yield, 17.7g.   (31%, or allowing for recovered ethyl sulfate, 43.5%). 

</p>

<p>

Routine run - A second experiment was then carried out using the same quantity of ethyl sulfate as above.   The recovered nitrite solution (lower layer) from the first run was concentrated by adding approximately 16 g. of sodium nitrite per 160ml of solution.   Yield 26.4g (46%, or allowing for recovered ethyl sulphate, 65%).   For each additional subsequent run approximately 16 g. of nitrite per 160 ml of solution were added, although this represents a rather diminishing concentration in view of the increased yield of nitroethane

</p>

<p>

<br>
<b>Method 3:</b>    from ethyl bromide (iodide) and sodium nitrite (dmf)<br>
32.5 grams of ethyl bromide (0.3 moles) was poured into a stirred solution of 600ml dimethylformamide and 36 grams dry NaNO<sub>2</sub> (0.52 mole) in a beaker standing in a water bath keeping the solution at room temperature as the reaction is slightly exothermic.   Always keep the solution out of direct sunlight.   The stirring was continued for six hours.   After that, the reaction mixture was poured into a 2500 ml beaker or flask, containing 1500 ml ice-water and 100 ml of petroleum ether.   The petroleum ether layer was poured off and saved, and the aqueous phase was extracted four more times with 100 ml of petroleum ether each, where after the organic extracts were pooled, and in turn was washed with 4x75ml of water.   The remaining organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the petroleum ether was removed by distillation under reduced pressure on a water bath, which temperature was allowed to slowly rise to about 65�C.   The residue, consisting of crude nitroethane was distilled under ordinary pressure (preferably with a small distillation column) to give 60% of product, boiling at 114-116�C. 

</p>

<p>

The ethyl bromide reacts with NaNO<sub>2</sub>, forming nitroethane and ethyl nitrite.<br>
This method can be varied in a few ways.   Firstly, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be substituted for the dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent.   Ethylene glycol also works as solvent, but the reaction proceeds pretty sluggishly in this medium, allowing for side reactions, such as this: RH-NO<sub>2</sub> + R-ONO =&gt; R-(NO)NO<sub>2</sub> + R-OH.   KNO<sub>2</sub> can also be used instead of NaNO<sub>2</sub>.   If NaNO<sub>2</sub> is used in DMF, 30g (0.5 mol) of urea can also be added as nitrite scavenger to minimize side reactions, as well as simultaneously increasing the solubility of the NaNO<sub>2</sub> and thereby significantly speeding up the reaction. 

</p>

<p>

If the ethyl bromide is substituted with ethyl iodide, the required reaction time is decreased to only 2.5 h instead of 6 h.   In case ethyl iodide is employed, a slight change in the above procedure needs to be done.   The pooled pet ether extracts should be washed with 2x75ml 10% sodium thiosulfate, followed by 2x75ml water, instead of 4x75ml water as above.   This to remove small amounts of free iodine

</p>

<p>

<b>Method 4</b> : from ethyl halide and silver nitrite

</p>

<p>

Cool 100 g of silver nitrite (0.65 mol) in 150 ml of dry ether to 0�C in a 3 neck 500 ml flask (in a darkened room or using yellow light).   Add 0.5 moles of ethyl halide (78g ethyl iodide or 55g of ethyl bromide) dropwise over a 2 hour period while stirring constantly and maintaining the temperature at 0�C and dark conditions.   Stir for 24 hours at 0�C, then 24 hours at room temp if using ethyl bromide, and 48h if using ethyl bromide.   (Test for halogens to see when the reaction is completed, through adding a few drops of the reaction mixture to a test tube containing an alcoholic solution of silver nitrate and note if a precipitate appears.   If so, the reaction is not complete.   The Beilstein test can also be used, it uses a small coil of copper wire in a test tube to which a small portion of the reaction mixture is added and it is noted if reaction occurs, where elemental silver will deposit on the surface of the copper coil.) Silver iodide (or bromide) will precipitate in the solution during the course of the reaction.   Filter off the silver salt, and wash it with several portions of ether.   Evaporate the ether at room temperature.   (This may be substituted with distillation of the ether using a water bath at atmospheric pressure.   A 2x45 cm column packed with 4 mm pyrex helices is used.   A more efficient column is not used due to the instability of the ethyl nitrite formed as a by-product in the reaction.   Maintain anhydrous conditions since the ethyl nitrite will hydrolyze to ethanol and will be difficult to separate.) Then vacuum distill the residue at about 5 mmHg.   The ethyl nitrite will be the initial fraction, followed by an intermediate fraction, then the nitroethane will distill.   The yield is about 83% of theory

<b>Method 5:</b>    oxidation of ethyl amine with peracids(m-perbenzoicacid)

</p>

<p>

General Procedure for the Oxidation of Primary & Secondary amines using m-chloroperbenzoic acid.

</p>

<p>

m-Chloroperbenzoic acid (4.1g, 0.02mol, 85% pure) is dissloved in 30 mls of 1,2-dichloroethane in a three-neck flask equipped with a condenser and a pressure-equalising dropping funnel.   The amine (0.005 mol) in 3-5 mls of 1,2-dichloroethane solvent is added drop-wize to the refluxing m-Chloroperbenzoic acid/1,2-dichloroethane solution.   Refluxing temperature 83oC for 3 hours.<br>
After the addition of the amine and refluxing time, the reaction mixture is cooled, filtered and washed with three 50 ml portions of 1M sodium hydroxide solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate.   The removal of the 1,2-dichloroethane solvent by distillation (rotary) gives a crude nitroalkane.   Purification of the crude crude nitroalkane with vacuum distillation.   Yields vary, approx 62 %.

</p>

<p>

Oxidation of n-propylamine and higher alkane amines give nitroalkane at approx 62 %.

<b>Method 8:</b>   oxidation of ethyl amine to nitroethane with dimethyldioxirane

</p>

<p>

A new synthesis of nitro compounds using dimethyldioxirane(DMDO)<br>
Tetrahedron Letters,Vol.27,No.21,pp 2335-2336,1986 

</p>

<p>

Abstract: Dimethyldioxirane oxidizes primary amines to nitro compounds in a facile, mild, high yield process.

</p>

<p>

Here we report that aliphatic and aromatic primary amines are rapidly and efficiently oxidized to nitro compounds by dimethyldioxirane, DMDO.   Indeed a survey of some general methods for the preparation of nitro compounds (2) suggests to us that the use of DMDO may be the method of choice.   The conditions used are exceedingly mild and give the nitro compound as a solution in acetone.   Table 1 summarizes our results with some representative amines.

<p>

In a typical reaction n-butylamine (0.052g; 0.7 mmol) in 5 ml of
acetone was treated with 95 ml of DMDO, in acetone solution (ca
0.05M)(4) The solution was kept at room temperature for 30 min. with
the exclusion of light.   Analysis of the reaction mixture
by capillary GC indicated the presence of l-nitrobutane
only.   The oxidations are believed to occur by means of
successive oxidations by,1.   In the aniline case the blue
color of the nitroso conpound is observed immediately upon adding the
solution of DMDO.   In separate experiments we have shown
that both phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene are readily oxidized
to nitrobenzene by DMDO.   The blue color of intermediate
nitroso compound was observed in all of the amine oxidations. 

</p>

<p>

Dimethyldioxirane is a powerful oxygen atom donor, which oxidizes a
variety of substrates 'including hydrocarbons'.   Work is
continuing on the oxidation of nitrogen-containing compounds by DMDO.

<b>Abstract</b>

</p>

<p>

The peroxymonosulfate-acetone system produces dimethyldioxirane under
conditions permitting distn. of the dioxirane from the synthesis
vessel.   The same conditions were used to prep. other
methyldioxiranes.   Solns. of dimethyldioxirane prepd. in
this manner were used to study its chem. and spectroscopic
properties.   The caroate-acetone system was also used to
study the chem. of in situ generated dimethyldioxirane.cis- And
trans-stilbenes were converted stereospecifically to the corresponding
epoxides with dimethyldioxirane in acetone.

<b>Method 10:</b>    ethyl bromide, DMSO, NaNO<sub>2</sub>
and phloroglucinol dihydrate

</p>

<p>

By Ritter, in Strike's book- TSII.

</p>

<p>

32g or 26ml EtBr is poured into 250ml of DMSO with 36g
NaNO<sub>2</sub> and 52g phloroglucinol already present in
solution.(Pglucinol is expensive but can be recycled) put on good mag.
stirring and stopper the flask.   Stir for two hours in
emulsion form, then dump into a 600ml of ice water and extract twice
with DCM.   (2x200ml) dry the extracts
withMgSO<sub>4</sub> or CaCl<sub>2</sub> the evap off the
DCM.   Distill and collect the fraction from 113-116�C---
yields about 20g of nitroethane (80%)(another ref says maybe over 90%
consistently)

</p>

<p>

Other notes:catechol and resorcinol have the same nitrite scavenging
abilities as phloroglucinol.   And ethylene glycol can be
used as a solvent.   A simple NaOH wash of the final
solution (nitroethane removed) will give the sodium salt of your
phloroglucinol catalyst.   Acidification of the solution
will precip the catalyst for recovery by filtration.

</p>

<p>

<b>Procedure</b>

</p>

<p>

A solution of potassium permanganate (0.3 mol) in water was made by
dissolving 47.41 g KMnO<sub>4</sub> in 400 mL hot water in a 1 L
3-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a stirbar[note 1],
thermometer, and a 100-mL addition funnel.   As the solution
cools to room temperature fine crystals of KMnO<sub>4</sub>
crystallise out of solution[note 2].   A solution of alanine
(0.1 mol, 8.91 g) in 65 mL of water was placed in the addition funnel
and added dropwise with stirring over a 20 minute period.  
The temperature slowly rose.   When the addition was
complete, the reaction mixture was heated to 60� over a period of
approximately 2 hours.   40 mL of acetone was added [note 3]
and then the reaction mixture maintained at 70-85� [the sludge was
extremely viscous and the stirbar was of no use] for 2
hours.   0.1 mol sodium hydroxide in 20 mL of water was then
added through the addition funnel.

</p>

<em>Pause (to be completed).</em>

<p>

The flask showed no sign of heating up after addition of the
NaOH.   By now the black/brown sludge will not mix (with the
stir-bar).   The next step is to heat to 80-100C to
decarboxylate any nitro-propionic acid and then to steam distil.

</p>

<p>

<b>Notes:</b>

</p>

<p>

1.   An overhead stirrer is essential - the stirbar will get
clogged with MnO<sub>2</sub>.

</p>

<p>

2.   KMnO<sub>4</sub> solubility is 1 in 3.5 parts of hot
water and 1 in 14 parts of cold water.

</p>

<p>

3.   The acetone was added to try to clear the
sludge.   I would have added more but I had second thoughts.

<b>Questions:</b>

</p>

<p>

1.   Is it safe to heat this mixture to 90C without a
stirrer? [the next step to make sure that nitro-propionic acid is
decarboxylated]

</p>

<p>

2.   Should I improvise an overhead stirrer to finish this
off?

</p>

<p>

3.   Nitroethane will steam distill won't it?

</p>

<p>

4.   Should the permanganate have been buffered?

</p>

<p>

5.   I think the NaOH should have been in there from the
start.   The sodium salt of alanine would have been a better
idea?

</p>

<p>

6a.   Would the reaction benefit from taking place in an
organic solvent?

</p>

<p>

6b.   If so, what solvents are suitable apart from acetone?

I will repeat this - with an overhead stirrer and the addition of
sodium salt of alanine rather than alanine followed by NaOH.

<b>Method 19:</b>   Reduction of acetaldehyde oxime and
oxidation of the product

</p>

<p>

Good work! An alternative method to alanine amino oxidation and
decarboxylation is the reaction : CH<sub>3</sub>CHO + NH<sub>2</sub>OH
==&gt; CH<sub>3</sub>CH=NOH,<br> Then carfully reduced to
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHOH, and then oxidized as proposed by you
above to get CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NO

<b>NEWEST METHOD</b>

</p>

<p>

<b>Method 20:</b>    reduction of nitroethene to nitroethane
using 2-phenylbenzimidazoline

just thought aurelius would add it to the compilation for posterity
and preservation.
