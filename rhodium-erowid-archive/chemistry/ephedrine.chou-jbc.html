<p>With the development in scientific medicine of the clinical use of the alkaloid ephedrine, there has been an
increasing interest in the preparation of this alkaloid, and an immediate need for accurate data in the
standardization of its salts.</p>

<p>In these laboratories large amounts of ephedrine have been prepared and it has been found that the basic
substance isolated from the Chinese shrub Ma Huang, variously identified as <em>Ephedra vulgaris Rich. var.
helvetica Hk. et Thorns</em><a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and <em>Ephedra equisetina, Bge.</em>,<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> consists chiefly of ephedrine together with
about 20 percent of its isomer pseudoephedrine. These two alkaloids were first prepared by Nagai<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> and Merck<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> respectively. They were found to be mutually convertible by boiling with hydrochloric acid and in other
ways<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, and have the empirical formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON.</p>

<p>The chemical structure of ephedrine, and its isomer OH-CH-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-CH-CH<sub>3</sub>NH-CH<sub>3</sub>, has been studied by many workers<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>6-8</sup></a> and synthetically proven for both alkaloids<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>9-12</sup></a>. It shows a close relationship in chemical structure
to epinephrine, to which it has been found to have similar, and in some respects superior physiological
effects<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>13-16</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The separation of the two alkaloids by some clear cut method has been the object of this investigation. While
the salts of ephedrine are better crystallized and less soluble in water and alcohol than those of
pseudoephedrine it has been found that the best means of separation depends upon the striking difference in
the solubility of their oxalates in cold water.</p>

<p>Pure preparations of the alkaloids and their salts were made and studied. While some of the physical constants
of the salts obtained do not agree with those published by Chen<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>, they do confirm such as are published by
several other workers<a href="ephedrine.chou-jbc.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>. The pure base heretofore considered to be levorotatory was found to be
dextrorotatory in water, and levorotatory in alcohol.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Extraction</h4>

<p>1 kilo of powdered Ma Huang was extracted with cold benzene in the presence of dilute Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution, and the
benzene extract was shaken up with a sufficient quantity of dilute HCl to remove the basic substances. The
acid solution was made alkaline with solid K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and the liberated base was then extracted with chloroform.
The chloroform solution, when dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and distilled, gave 2.6 g of crude base.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Ephedrine HCl by Fractional Crystallization</strong></p>

<p>The crude base obtained as above was taken up with about twice its weight of alcohol and neutralized with
concentrated HCl diluted with twice its volume of alcohol. Nearly pure ephedrine hydrochloride crystallized
out on standing. After filtering it was washed with a mixture of alcohol and ether, and then with pure ether,
and dried. A further quantity of ephedrine hydrochloride may be got by concentrating the mother liquors and
washings. The final mother liquor was kept for the isolation of pseudoephedrine (see below).</p>

<p>Ephedrine hydrochloride crystallized out from alcohol in prismatic needles, mp 216°C, [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> -32.5° (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong>).</p>

<p>The salts prepared by fractional crystallization show no change in the melting point when recrystallized seven
times. In many of our experiments the salts were recrystallized twelve times.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of the Oxalates by Difference of Solubility</strong></p>

<p>The crude base as obtained when treated with oxalic acid give a clear-cut separation of the two alkaloidal
salts. Ephedrine oxalate being only very slightly soluble in cold water and pseudoephedrine oxalate being
exceedingly soluble, the soluble and insoluble products represented a separation of the two alkaloids.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Pure ephedrine Base</strong></p>

<p>5g of pure ephedrine hydrochloride, dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water, were made alkaline with solid
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> until two layers were formed and extracted twice with chloroform. The chloroform solution was well dried
over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and distilled. On cooling the residue crystallised out in rhombic crystals. It was
recrystallized by dissolving in a small quantity of alcohol and then adding a sufficient quantity of petroleum
ether, mp 43°C. (see <strong>Fig. 2</strong>).</p>

<h4>Properties of Pure Ephedrine</h4>

<p>Ephedrine was found to be very soluble in water, alcohol, and chloroform and nearly insoluble in petroleum
ether upon cooling. Being a strong base, ephedrine displaces ammonia from its salts. Solutions of the salts in
water varying from 1 to 10 percent were found to be exceedingly stable. No change in strength occurred after 6
months storage at room temperature. The solutions are quite sable at boiling temperature. Its specific
rotation varied with the different solvents used.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span class="oli">[&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> +13.75° in water.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli"> [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> - 5.5° in absolute alcohol</span></li>
</ol>

<p>A part of the pure ephedrine so obtained was transformed into its corresponding salts. They gave the following physical constants.</p>

<p><strong>Ephedrine Hydrochloride</strong>. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·HCl
<br>Prismatic needles, mp 216°C., [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> -32.5°. Easily soluble in alcohol and water. Its aqueous solation is stable at boiling temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Ephedrine Sulfate</strong>. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><br>Hexagonal plates; mp 257°C, [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> -30°. Difficultly soluble in alcohol, easily soluble in water, neutral to litmus.</p>

<p><strong>Ephedrine oxalate</strong>. 2 C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
<br>Prismatic needles from. water; mp 245°C. with decomposition; neutral to litmus; only very slightly soluble in cold water (see <strong>Fig. 3</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Ephedrine Phosphate</strong>. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.
<br>Crystallized from alcohol in long silky needles; mp 178°C; acid to litmus.</p>

<h4>Pseudoephedrine</h4>

<p>The alcoholic mother liquor obtained after the removal of ephedrine hydrochloride as indicated above was first concentrated and then evaporated to dryness an a water bath. The residue was taken up with a little water, made alkaline with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, extracted with chloroform, and distilled. The basic residue was transformed into its corresponding sulfate by neutralizing with concentrated sulfuric acid diluted previously with alcohol. The crude sulfate so obtained consisted chiefly of pseudoephedrine sulfate. Its free base was obtained by dissolving in water, making alkaline with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and extracting with chloroform. Pure pseudoephedrine crystallized out from alcohol in rhombic prisms, mp 118°C, [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> +50° (see <strong>Fig. 4</strong>). Unlike ephedrine it was only slightly soluble in water. Its salts were prepared and gave the following physical constants.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride</strong>. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·HCl.
<br>Crystallized from alcohol in stout needles; mp 179-181°C, [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> +58.75°; very soluble in water and in alcohol (see <strong>Fig. 5</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Pseudoephedrine Sulfate</strong>. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> .
<br>Prismatic needles; no sharp mp; [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub><sup>22</sup> +52.5°; easily soluble in water and in alcohol.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudoephedrine Oxalate</strong>. 2 C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>ON·C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><br>
  Needles; mp 218°C with decomposition; difficultly soluble in alcohol; very soluble in cold H<sub>2</sub>O; neutral to litmus (see <strong>Fig. 6</strong>).</p>

<h4>Action of HCl upon ephedrine. Preparation of Pseudoephedrine.</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span class="oli">50 g ephedrine HCl</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">350 mL concentrated HCl</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">175 mL H<sub>2</sub>O</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Boiled gently with reflux condenser for 12 hours. The acid solution was evaporated low over a water bath and
allowed to crystallize; the crystallized HCl salt consisted of nearly pure unchanged ephedrine hydrochloride.
If the acid solution had been, sufficiently concentrated practically all the unchanged ephedrine hydrochloride
would have crystallized out, Filtered, washed with a little dilute HCl, and used the filtrate for the
preparation of pseudoephedrine. The acid filtrate eves then evaporated to dryness over a water bath. The
residue was taken up with a little water, made alkaline with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and extracted with chloroform. The
chloroform solution, then well dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and concentrated, deposited pseudoephedrine in
rhombic crystals. The base obtained melted at 118°C and was identical in all respects with pseudoephedrine
obtained from the crude drug.</p>
