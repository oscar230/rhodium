<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Optically active 4-methoxy-&alpha;-methylphenylethylamine (<strong>1</strong>), a useful chiral building block in medicinal chemistry, was synthesized from L- or D-tyrosine by using a simple and efficient procedure via one-pot zinc reduction of the corresponding O-tosylate (<strong>4</strong>) in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O and NaI in pure form.</p>
</div>

<p>Optically active &alpha;�methylphenylethylamines, such as 4-methoxy-&alpha;-methylphenylethylamine (<strong>1</strong>), are important chiral building blocks in medicinal chemistry. For example, one of our research targets is TA-2005<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, (R,R)-8-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]aminoethyl]quinolin-2(<em>1H</em>)-one hydrochloride, which proved to be a potent, long-acting, and &beta;<sub>2</sub>-selective agonist. The pure R form of amine <strong>1</strong> in large enough quantities is required for the bulk preparation of TA-2005 (R,R-isomer). Synthesis of the enantiomers of <strong>1</strong> via fractional crystallization of the tartrate<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> of (�)-<strong>1</strong> or via asymmetric reduction<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> of the corresponding imine derivatives of 4-methoxyphenylacetone and (+)- and (-)-&alpha;-methylbenzylamines has been described previously. These methods have a number of disadvantages that include low resolution yield (9%) for the former reported method and loss of the chiral amine source in the hydrogenolysis step for the latter method. We therefore attempted to develop a new synthetic approach to both enantiomeric forms of <strong>1</strong>.</p>

<p>Considering the structural similarity between commercially available L-tyrosine and R-<strong>1</strong>, the conversion of the CO<sub>2</sub>H group of tyrosine into a methyl group<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> was investigated (<strong>Scheme 1</strong>).</p> 

<div class="pic right">

</div>

<p>Esterification of L-tyrosine with EtOH in the presence of SOCl<sub>2</sub> followed by N-protection with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride and O-methylation of the phenolic hydroxy group (CH<sub>3</sub>I/K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in DMSO) afforded S-<strong>2</strong> in quantitative yield. Reduction of the ester group of S-<strong>2</strong> with NaBH<sub>4</sub> according to the method of Yamada et al.<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> gave the corresponding alcohol (S-<strong>3</strong>) in 86% yield. Tosylation of S-<strong>3</strong> was effectively performed by using n-Bu<sub>4</sub>N&middot;HSO<sub>4</sub><a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> as a phase transfer catalyst in benzene / aqueous NaOH or in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> / aqueous NaOH to give the O-tosylate (S-<strong>4</strong>) in quantitative yield. Treatment of S-4 with NaI in refluxing aqueous THF afforded the corresponding iodide (S-<strong>5</strong>) in 69% yield.</p> 

<p>Zinc reduction of the iodide (S-<strong>5</strong>) in anhydrous dimethoxyethane according to the method reported by <em>Fujimoto et al.</em><a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> gave a mixture of products, which were separated by column chromatography (SiO<sub>2</sub>) providing the methyl derivative R-<strong>6</strong> (21%) along with <strong>7</strong> (18.5%), <strong>8</strong> (13%), and <strong>9</strong> (42%), respectively (<strong>Scheme 2</strong>). Mechanistically, we believe that the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O to the reaction mixture is necessary to hydrolyze the corresponding RZnI. <em>P. Kocovsky et. al</em><a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> reported the zinc reduction of steroidal alcohol via their mesylates and tosylates with NaI in refluxing DME, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O without any comment in their experimental section. <em>Fujimoto et. al</em><a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> didn't mention the necessity of H<sub>2</sub>O in this reaction.</p>

</div>

<p>Zinc reduction of the iodide (S-<strong>5</strong>) was effectively carried out in aqueous dimethoxyethane to give the desired methyl derivative (S-<strong>6</strong>) in 82% yield We successfully utilized the above sequence in a one-pot conversion of S-<strong>4</strong> into R-<strong>6</strong>. Thus, zinc reduction of S-<strong>4</strong> in aqueous THF in the presence of NaI gave R-<strong>6</strong> in 87% yield from S-<strong>4</strong> (<strong>Scheme 3</strong>). Catalytic hydrogenolysis of R-<strong>6</strong> on 10% Pd/C furnished R-<strong>1</strong> in 86% yield (mp and [&alpha;]<sub>D</sub>, value were identical with the literature value).<a href="tyrosine2pma.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> The optical purity of R-<strong>1</strong> was determined to be >99.8% <em>ee</em> by HPLC analysis (see the Experimental Section). The corresponding enantiomer, S-<strong>1</strong> was also obtained from D- tyrosine by using this method (<strong>Scheme 3</strong>). In this report, we have demonstrated that chiral 4-methoxy-&alpha;-methylphenylethylamine (<strong>1</strong>) can be prepared from tyrosine with high efficiency using very simple and robust chemistry which avoids the problems associated with previously reported approaches. This simple procedure for preparation of chiral a-methylphenylethylamines is also applicable to other our targets, such as TXA<sub>2</sub> antagonists.</p>
