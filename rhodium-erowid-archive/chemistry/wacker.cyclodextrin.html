<p>Terminal olefins are oxidised to ketone in high yields under mild conditions using palladium chloride and cyclodextrins as catalysts in
two-phase systems; cyclodextrins show substrate selectivity.</p>

<p>Cyclodextrins (CDs) form inclusion compounds with various organic molecules<a href="wacker.cyclodextrin.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and they have been extensively studied as a
model of enzymes<a href="wacker.cyclodextrin.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, in most of the reactions reported CDs are not catalysts and so their applications to organic
syntheses have been limited. Previously we reported that CDs form inclusion compounds with some organometallic complexes<a href="wacker.cyclodextrin.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. Now we found a system in which CDs function as catalysts and show
marked substrate selectivity. Here we report the first example of the use of CDs as inclusion catalysts for effecting reactions catalysed by
transition metal complexes in aqueous-organic two-phase systems.</p>

<p>We have examined the behaviour of CDs in the oxidation of terminal olefins to the corresponding methyl ketones. Although ethylene can be
oxidized to acetaldehyde by PdCl<sub>2</sub> in an aqueous system (Wacker oxidation), higher <i>alpha</i>-olefins are oxidized to methyl
ketones only very slowly or not oxidized in entirely aqueous solutions of PdCl<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

Now we have found that on addition of CD into this system, terminal
olefins are smoothly oxidized under mild conditions to give the
corresponding methyl ketones in high yields and that cyclodextrins
show substrate selectivity.

</p>

<p>

In a typical experiment, dec-1-ene (25 mmol) was added to an aqueous
solution of <i>alpha</i>-CD (1.0 mmol), PdCl<sub>2</sub> (1.0 mmol),
and CuCl<sub>2</sub>(10 mmol) at 75 �C. When oxygen was bubbled though
an aqueous solution and stirred vigoursly, decan-2-one was obtained in
76% yield. No oxidation products were obtained without
<i>alpha</i>-CD.

</p>

<p>

The results on the oxidation of some long-chain olefins by the present
catalytic system are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1,
which shows that the yield of ketone depends strongly on the substrate
employed and high yields are obtained with the substrate having
C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> structures. The yield suddenly drops when
the carbon number of the substrate exceed ten, indicating that the
PdCl<sub>2</sub> system shows high substrate selectivity. Essentially
no reations of internal olefins were observed under the present
conditions.

<p>

It should be noted that <i>alpha</i>-CD is effective as catalyst and
it can be recovered simply by cooling the solution and can be reused.
<i>Beta</i>-CD is also effective as the catalyst and shows similar
selectivity. The metal catalyst can be reused without any reduction in
yields. Oxygen can be replaced by air.

</p>

  <p> Recently, Alper et al. reported that the reaction was carried in two-phase 
    systems with quaternary ammonium salts as phase transfer catalysts and CCl<sub>4</sub> 
    as solvent<a href="wacker.cyclodextrin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. In our system isolation of the products from catalyst or solvent 
    is quite easy because no organic solvents are required, and the CD and PdCl<sub>2</sub> 
    catalysts are soluble only in an aqueous phase. </p>

<p>

One possible pathway of the reaction may be the initial formation of
CD complexes with substrates. CD extracts substrates from the organic
phase allowing them to form complexes with PdCl<sub>2</sub>. Then the
substrates undergo oxidation to yield ketones. Unlike with the phase
transfer catalysts generally used, such as quarternary ammonium salts,
the reaction proceeds in the aqueous phase in our system.

</p>

  <p> The results show that this new system consisting of cyclodextrin and PdCl<sub>2</sub> 
    is effective and selective catalysts for oxidation of long-chain <i>alpha</i>-olefins 
    to ketones in a two-phase system and that separation of the products from 
    catalysts or solvents is quite easy.<a href="wacker.cyclodextrin.html#refs"><sup>5,6</sup></a></p>
