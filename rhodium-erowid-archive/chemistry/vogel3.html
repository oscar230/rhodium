<p>One of the best books there is out there teaching practical organic chemistry is the one written by <b>Arthur I. Vogel</b>. The author is now deceased, but his teachings continues to live
on - there has even been published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582462363/">a fifth edition</a> of his masterpiece <b>A Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry</b> after
his death, containing many new preparations and procedures with techniques discovered in the last decades, which has been added to the book by other editors. However, the third edition of his
book (first published in 1956) is actually of much better use to the hobby chemist, as it does not make use of any hideously expensive glassware/apparatus or exotic reagents or catalysts.
Back in those days, an organic chemist was supposed to make many of his precursors himself, and to purify solvents and reagents in the lab before using them, as they were not available from
chemical supply houses in 99.99% purity. There are even sections on glass-blowing in the book. The organic chemists of that day hadn't access to million-dollar NMR machines or GC/MS analytical
equipment, therefore the preparations in this book don't require the use of such unavailable machines to identify products, only simple melting points to be taken, or the identification of
certain odors, colors or crystal shapes.</p>

<p>The book has been scanned and turned into PDF format by <b>Polverone</b>, making a 73 MB file out of the thick 1200 page book. With the help of <b>Hypo</b> and <b>Hocatka</b> this PDF was
converted it to the much more compact format <b>DjVu</b>, being only about a fifth of that size with almost the same quality and much faster viewing. As the bandwidth consumed will be much
less using this format, it's possible to make it available online at this site.</p>

<h3>New!</h3>
<p>Now (July 2003), <b>Polverone</b> has presented an improved version of the book in PDF format, with cleaned-up scans, an included OCR layer beneath the text (making it possible to
cut-n-paste directly from the PDF), and JBIG2-compression of the images, making this improved version of <a href="http://bcis.pacificu.edu/~polverone/vogel.html">Vogel's Practical Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.</a> only around 23MB!</p>
