  <h2>Synthesis of 3-Methyl- and<br>4-Methyl-2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde</h2>

<div class="stdtxt"> 
  <p>Of the two required isomeric aldehydes, 2,5-dimethoxy-3-methylbenzaldehyde 
    (<strong>I</strong>) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde (<strong>II</strong>), 
    the latter was synthesised from 2,5-dimethoxytoluene by a Gattermann reaction; 
    but this and several other direct methods failed to convert 4-methoxy-2-methylphenol 
    (<strong>III</strong>) into the corresponding aldehyde. Compound (<strong>I</strong>) 
    was finally prepared by oxidation with selenium dioxide<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>1</sup></a> 
    of 3-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dimethoxytoluene (<strong>IV</strong>), which was synthesised 
    by two different procedures.</p>

  <p>By the Lederer-Manasse reaction<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, with formaldehyde 
    and calcium hydroxide in water, 4-methoxy-2-methylphenol (<strong>III</strong>) 
    was converted into 2-hydroxymethyl-4-methoxy-6-methylphenol (<strong>V</strong>) 
    which gave compound (<strong>IV</strong>) on methylation.</p>
  <p>The alcohol (<strong>V</strong>) partially decomposed during distillation 
    under reduced pressure to an uncharacterised phenolic material. From the reaction 
    of o-toluquinol and formaldehyde followed by methylation, Euler and his co-workers<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>3</sup></a> 
    isolated a compound (<strong>A</strong>) to which they assigned the structure 
    (<strong>IV</strong>) on the basis of its conversion into a 2,5-dihydroxymethylbenzoic 
    acid which depressed the melting point of 2,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid 
    prepared by the Kolbe reaction. The compound (<strong>A</strong>) was not 
    found by us to be the same as our product (<strong>IV</strong>) and we have 
    identified it as 4-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dimethoxytoluene by obtaining the aldehyde 
    (<strong>II</strong>) from its oxidation with selenium dioxide, and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzoic 
    acid<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>4</sup></a> by alternative oxidation procedures. By 
    this result the structural assignment of the aldehyde (<strong>II</strong>) 
    is also confirmed.</p>
  <p>The second synthesis of compound (<strong>IV</strong>) was of poor yield. 
    It involved a Mannich reaction of compound (<strong>III</strong>) with formaldehyde 
    and dimethylamine<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>5</sup></a> yielding 2-dimethylaminomethyl-4-methoxy-6-methylphenol 
    (<strong>VI</strong>), which, when heated with acetic anhydride<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, 
    gave 2-acetoxy-5-methoxy-3-methylbenzyl acetate (<strong>VII</strong>). This 
    was hydrolysed with alkali and compound (<strong>IV</strong>) was obtained 
    by methylation of the hydrolysate. A by-product of this reaction was <em>bis</em>-(2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)methane 
    (<strong>VIII</strong>), which may have arisen from the reversible decomposition 
    of 2-hydroxymethyl-4-methoxy-6-methylphenol (<strong>V</strong>) to give 4-methoxy-2-methylphenol 
    (<strong>III</strong>) and formaldehyde, followed by the condensation of compound 
    (<strong>III</strong>) with compound (<strong>V</strong>) or with an intermediate 
    arising from compound (<strong>V</strong>) by loss of a molecule of water.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

    <h4>2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde (II) </h4>
    <p><strong>(a)</strong> This compound was synthesised in 89.6% yield from 
      2,5-dimethoxytoluene, hydrogen cyanide, and aluminium chloride, according 
      to the standard Gattermann procedure<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, it had bp 111-116�C/0.9mmHg, mp 85-86�C.</p>
    <p><strong>(b)</strong> To compound (<strong>A</strong>)<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>3</sup></a> 
      (18.2 g.), mp 74.5-75�C, dissolved in benzene (60 ml), finely powdered selenium 
      dioxide (5.5g) was added and the suspension was azeotropically distilled 
      until the formation of water stopped. Distillation of the residue under 
      reduced pressure gave 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde (11.5g, 63.8%), 
      mp 84-85�C, having an infrared spectrum identical with that of the material 
      obtained in <strong>(a)</strong>, and causing no depression of its melting 
      point.</p>

    <h4>2-Hydroxymethyl-4-methoxy-6-methylphenol (V) </h4>
    <p>Calcium oxide (28 g) was added gradually to a suspension of 4-methoxy-2-methylphenol 
      (138g) in water (800 ml) and 37% formalin (81 g) under nitrogen. The mixture 
      was shaken until solution was complete and then kept overnight. The solution 
      solidified when shaked; it was diluted with water and acidified with acetic 
      acid, and the oily phenol was extracted with ether. The extract, after being 
      washed with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and water and dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), 
      was evaporated. Distillation of the product (137.5g) under reduced pressure 
      caused extensive decomposition. The distillate of 2-hydroxymethyl-4-methoxy-6-methylphenol, 
      bp 136-140�C/1mmHg, had mp 58-59�C after crystallisation from isohexane.</p>

    <h4>3-Hydroxymethyl-2,5-dimethoxytoluene (IV) </h4>
    <p><strong>(a)</strong> To a solution of crude compound (<strong>V</strong>) 
      (137.5g) in acetone (200 ml) were added anhydrous potassium carbonate (115 
      g) and methyl iodide (125 g). The solution boiled, and boiling under reflux 
      was continued for 18 h, then the solution was poured into a large volume 
      of water, and the precipitated oil extracted with ether. The extract was 
      washed with 2N sodium hydroxide solution and repeatedly with water, then 
      dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and distilled in a vacuum to give a 
      main fraction, bp 109-116�C/0.6mmHg, n<sub>D</sub><sup>24</sup> 1.5327-15344, 
      of slightly impure 3-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dimethoxytoluene [98.2 g, 54% based 
      on (<strong>III</strong>)] .</p>    
    <p><strong>(b)</strong> To a mixture of compound (<strong>III</strong>) (20 
      g) and 23% dimethylamine (29g) was added 37% formalin (13g) dropwise with 
      stirring and cooling to keep the temperature below 20�C. After it had been 
      stirred for 2 hr. the mixture was extracted with benzene and the extract 
      dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and evaporated to give crude 2-dimethylaminomethyl-4-methoxy-6-phenol 
      (<strong>VI</strong>) which was heated under reflux with boiling acetic 
      anhydride (50g). This solution was then diluted with water and extracted 
      with benzene, the extract washed with water, sodium carbonate, and then 
      water, the benzene was evaporated, and the residue (<strong>VII</strong>) 
      hydrolysed in boiling aqueous methanolic sodium hydroxide for 3h. This alkaline 
      solution was acidified and extracted with ether. From this extract impure 
      (<strong>VIII</strong>), mp 126-130�C, was obtained. The alkaline solution 
      containing compound (<strong>V</strong>), was methylated (dimethyl sulphate), 
      acidified with hydrochloric acid, and extracted with ether. On evaporation 
      of the extract-two fractions were obtained, <strong>(i)</strong> bp 113-118�C/1mmHg, 
      n<sub>D</sub><sup>22.5</sup> 1.5350 (3.1g), having an infrared spectrum 
      identical with that of the material prepared in <strong>(a)</strong> ; <strong>(ii)</strong> 
      bp 205�C/0.9mmHg, mp 135-137�C after crystallisation from <em>n</em>-hexane 
      (4.2 g.). The latter was identified as <em>bis</em>-(2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)methane 
      (<strong>VIII</strong>)</p>
    <h4>2,5-Dimethoxy-3-methyl benzaldehyde (I)</h4>
    <p>Finely powdered selenium dioxide (30g) was added to a solution of compound 
      (<strong>IV</strong>) (95.8g) in benzene (100 ml), and the suspension azeotropically 
      distilled until the formation of water was complete (3.5g of water collected). 
      The residue was distilled under reduced pressure and after a fore-run of 
      red oil (6.2g), 2,5-dimethoxy-3-methylbenzaldehyde (71.5g, 75%), bp 89-91�C/0.5mmHg, 
      mp 40-41�C, was collected. It crystallised from ligroin as white needles, 
      mp 42�C.</p>
