Excerpt from the article "MAY YOU NEVER SLEEP - Cognition Enhancing Drugs"
by R.U. Sirius, published in Whole Earth Review No.57 Winter 1987

EUPHORIA - Well, someone took Pemoline, twisted it around a little bit and
 put a whole lot of pleasure into the equation. This might be a Dangerous
 drug! There are lot of different things that seem to happen with Euphoria.
 The first time I took it (40 milligrams - I've learned since that 25 mg. is
 considered your basic dose) I got really charged up. This is definitely a
 High and it comes on suddenly (about 45 minutes after ingestion). My first
 response upon coming on to it was an experience of an intense rush of
 perceived personal power. I found myself goosestepping down the busy Berkeley
 streets thinking about how good I felt, how successful I was destined to be,
 and knowing that the world was my oyster. After about 15 minutes of this as
 I found myself leaping down the BART escalator, I had to tell myself to slow
 down for fear that I would be completely drained later on. Although I didn't
 really slow down at all during this experience, I did bring myself into a
 somewhat more humane mindset and I spent the subway ride having an almost
 methoxylated amphetamine (MDMA, MDA, etc.)-type ideations. In other words, I
 wasn't just feeling good about myself, I was feeling good about most
 everybody else. The world was everybody's oyster.

 Arriving at my office, I immediately found myself doing organizational work
 at about three times the normal rate with far more self-assurance and fewer
 mistakes than usual. Simultaneously, I was entertaining perspectives on the
 nature of my true will and making important phonecalls which I had put off
 for some time. I did about thirty hours worth of work in about ten hours. I
 literally could not stop. I tried to make myself take a break for about ten
 minutes. Within a minute, I found my hand going into a drawer to pull out
 another file which needed reorganizing. Believe me, this is very unusual
 behavior. I hate organizational work.

 This all might sound like the first blushes of an amphetamine high, but
 he emotional overtones and the mentation under this substance is of a softer
 and more inwardly whole (less alienated) quality. As I've already indicated,
 the Euphoria high seems to have a slight methoxylated amphetamine quality to
 it. All in all, this was a very powerful experiencing of clarity,
 self-assurance and cognitive ability. The following day, I experienced the
 same sort of effects at about one-third the intensity. There was no burnout
 at all in aftermath.

 Subsequent experiments have shown Euphoria to be predictable as an effective
 tool for organizing binges, brainstorming sessions and radio talk-show
 appearances. It also seems to induce ongoing personal growth in terms of
 clarity of personal will. (I've received three other testimonies in this
 same direction.) As a writing tool, I've found Euphoria to be variable. It
 seems that verbal acuity comes on strong but the verbal circuits burn out
 quickly from intensity of use and one has to move on to less verbally
 oriented tasks. In other words, this is generally good for creative flashes
 and outlining grand syntheses but not too good for actual completion of
 written work. It gives one an impatience for minutiae and the kind of
 careful faceting that it takes to bring a work to completion. In terms of
 appreciation and comprehension of aesthetics and information, this seems the
 opposite of its close cousin Pemoline. The accessing mode favored is
 visual. One wants to explore a painting or photograph or watch a movie
 rather than read a book.

 My only complaint about Euphoria is that it lasts 16 hours, which feels
 about 4 hours too long. In two of my five experiences, the last four hours
 were spent feeling slightly "headachy" and weary, although there was still
 no burnout following sleep. I would say, at this point, that Euphoria should
 not be used more often than once a week since it is so powerful and so much
 energy is expended in the experience. This is easily the most Fun of the
 intelligence increasers and, as such, is probably the most likely to be
 abused.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is available in all larger urban areas, but is not common. You need to
be pretty well connected to get it.

Boiling point is very low. You can smoke it by placing about 10 mg on 
aluminum foil, and holding a lighter under the foil to warm it. It 
vaporizes into a white cloud, and you suck the smoke through a tube
or something to help catch all the smoke. It comes in a white powder, and 
looks similar to good white heroin. I think it would be hard to 
adulterate, unless you adulterated it with something that also vaporized 
very easily. Ie, if you aldulterated it with sugar, the Aminorex would 
evaporate first, then the sugar would just burn, and you would be aware 
that you got burned.

Not many side effects. If you do a large amount for several days you can 
get diareaha. Nothing too severe though. A bit of dry mouth is common 
after smoking it. I also started to get a sore throat after smoking for 
a solid week.

I developed somewhat of a tolerance after 4-5 days of constant use. A few 
days off, and the tolerance seemed to disappear. My brain was so clear 
when I used this, that I came up with answers to problems that had been 
bugging me for months. This stuff makes your brain work at 100% 
efficiency and doubles processor speed. It makes you feel (and probably 
actually does) like your IQ jumped quite a bit. It is kind of a bummer 
not doing it at the moment because my brain feels so slow now in 
comparison to before. A gram would last you anywhere from a week to a 
month depending on how much you do. I estimate one hit at 10 mg, so a 
gram would give you 100 hits. 2 hits makes you feel alert. 5 hits makes 
you euphoric and will let you stay up all night long without feeling the 
least bit tired. Sleep will never even occur to you. Do 2 more hits in
the morning before work, and you will never miss the sleep from the night 
before. As a matter of fact, you will feel better than if you had skipped 
the drug and slept all night!

Synthesis of Methylaminorex: US Patent #3,161,650

	A mixture of 300cc of methanol and 50cc of water is used to dissolve 
about 35g (.187 mole) of 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol hydrochloride and 16.9g 
(0.411 mole) of sodium acetate. To this solution there is added a 
solution of 21.6g (0.206 mole) of cyanogen bromide in 200cc of methanol. 
The mixture is stirred for one half hour at room temperature and then 
concentrated under vacuum to remove the methanol. The residue is taken 
up in water and the resulting aqueous solution is made strongly basic with 
10% sodium hydroxide and then saturated with potassium carbonate. The 
resulting precipitate of the crude product is filtered off, washed twice 
with water and dried. The yield of 2-amino-4-methyl-5-phenyloxazoline if 
12g (m. 155.5-158.5 degrees). After recrystallization from benzene, the 
product melts at 154.5-156 degrees.

At 1986 Rainbow Gathering in Pennsylvania some people combined 4-methyl 
aminorex with LSD (stoopid!) and had bad experiences, which  gave the drug 
a bad reputation. Popularity increase all over the world  is predicted in 
the future. It was put in Schedule I on October 15, 1987 after a seizure 
of a high production lab in Florida. A fatality involving Euphoria has 
been reported (Journal of Forensic Sciences 33:2 March 1988 pp 549-553), 
allegedly after daily use for several months in combination with 
phenobarbital. In post-mortem analysis the concentration of U4Euh in blood 
was found to be 21.3 mg/L (!). The guy who has been giving away Euphoria 
and info about it, The Friendly Stranger (you know those old 'Beware!..' 
marijuana scare posters), seems to know his business pretty well (PM&E v4).

When ingested orally the usual dosage is 15-30 mg as the free base (18-36 
mg as the HCl), onset of effects 1-2 hours, duration 14-16 hours. 
"Qualitatively, the experience is similar to a long-lasting MDMA 
intoxication superimposed with methamphetamine, with the added benefits of 
easy verbalization, free association, integration and elaboration of 
previous insights.." - The New Age Chemist, PM&E 4. Transient somatic 
effects: increased respiration, tachycardia, tremors, perspiration, 
increased blood pressure, intraocular pressure, blurred visionand tightness 
in the chest. Increased body and breath odor.

            Further Comments on U4Euh, With More Recent Addenda
                              by Thomas Lyttle
             Published in the essay compilation "Psychedelics"

    There are two classic papers presently being circulated in the
underground, or among those purchasing illegal or not officially approved
versions of U4Euh, Intellex or 4-MethylAminorex. These periodically revised
papers, authored by The Friendly Stranger, are U4Eub, a four-page flyer and
What Happened When the Friendly Stranger Introduced U4Eub at four to six
pages in flyer form. Both are offset or photocopied and stamped, usually in
red ink. with the words NOT for PUBLICATION or PUBLIC DISCLOSURE over the
main text in various spots. After conferencing with the Friendly Stranger,
it has been decided that at this time the information contained in both
these instructional manuals should remain private and available only to
those actively involved in legitimate archiving, legal pharmacology or
medical practices in countries allowing for U4Euh's prescription.
    Recent mystifications regarding U4Euh have been potentiated in popular
press articles in The Whole Earth Review (Summer 1988), Street
Pharmacologist (SP)(Dec. 1987) and elsewhere.
    The following letter from The Friendly Stranger is reproduced in
response to the SP (N.I.D.A.)-sponsored article. For the sake of clarity
and continuity, both the short SP piece is reproduced verbatim, as is the
FS (Friendly Stranger) letter of response.

From Street Pharmacologist, (December 1987):

                             The Ice Man Cometh

    A new clandestine, synthetic drug has been reported in Florida. Ice,
also known as U4Euh on the street, is synthesized from phenylpropanolamine
(PPA), a central nervous system stimulant, and cyanogen bromide, a
derivative of the poisonous gas, cyanide. The chemical name of Ice (U4Euh)
is 4-methyl aminorex.
    Aminorex was researched as a diet aid between the 1950s and 1960s.
McNeil Laboratories received a patent and began testing it in 1964.
Aminorex was subsequently shelved because its stimulant properties were too
potent. When taken at lower doses, Ice produces amphetamine-like effects. A
hallucinogenic effect, similar to PCP, occurs at higher doses.
    Some drug dealers are marketing Ice as cocaine or crystal
methampetamine. Ice may be taken in powder or liquid form. Most users snort
it or mix it in a drink. A small percentage of users administer it
intravenously. Florida law enforcement officials have identified
approximately 15 cases in central and northeast Florida involving the
powdered drug.
    The first documented overdose fatally occurred in 1986. A 37-year-old
male with a history of clandestine chemical manufacturing was found dead in
a Florida hotel room. A plastic bag containing white powder was discovered
in his pocket. the bag was labeled "4-methyl aminorex free base. Not for
injection. For sacramental use only." An autopsy report confirmed the cause
of death to be a drug overdose.
    As a result, the DEA classified Ice as a Schedule 1 drug on October 15,
1987. Prior to the emergency scheduling, a clandestine lab was seized in
Pennsylvania where Ice was manufactured. A Gainesville, Florida lab was
seized after Ice was banned. The state of Florida outlawed the substance in
1986.

        The following is The Friendly Stranger's response to Street
Pharmacologist - which they apparently refused to print.

                            In Defense of U4Euh

    You have seen only the bad side of U4Euh, so I can understand your
yellow journalism. I can understand it, but I do not forgive it. Yes, it is
made from a "stimulant" and a "poison." But common table salt is composed
of sodium and chlorine, both of which are poisonous.
    Aminorex was withdrawn, at least in Europe, because it caused
degenerative pulmonary hypertension after prolonged, daily use. Possibly
due to the methyl group, we have detected no similar tendency in U4Euh.
    As for "amphetamine-like effects," you could have used a neutral term
like "alpha-adrenergic effects," but NOOOooo...Doesn't every "stimulant"
(another buzz word) produce "Amphetamine-like effects?" What about
caffeine? As for "hallucinogenic effect" on "higher doses," how much
higher? VERY MUCH higher�ENORMOUS overdoses. Were the hallucinations caused
by it, or by a lack of sleep? The recommended amount is ten to twenty-five
milligrams, maximum of fifty milligrams, not more than once a week.
"...similar to PCP"�another buzz word.
    Yes, I am bothered that people misrepresent it. KNOW YOUR DEALER! "A
small percentage of users administer it intravenously." HOW small a
percentage? Obviously, if it was a large percentage, you'd include a
number. A "small percentage" of needle freaks will shoot anything Only a
small percentage shoot U4Euh because needle freaks prefer the rush from
speed. "nobody that (sic) can get meth likes it." (anon.)
    "The first...fatality"�have there been other deaths, or was that the
ONLY one? Considering how much there may be out there, only one fatality
would tend to indicate its relative safety. That fatality had reportedly
been using it one or more times every day for several months, and taking
phenobarb to sleep. He would gobble almost anything he could get his hands
on. "...a history of clandestine chemical manufacturing"...ONE
conviction..."cause of death to be a drug overdose." A drug. What drug? Did
U4Euh cause it, did something else cause it, or was it the synergistic
effect of several substances? Exactly what did the autopsy show? That he
lived as long as did, despite such outrageous abuse of it, is proof of its
relative safety.
    This is, of necessity, anonymous. To paraphrase Miranda, anything you
write can and damned well WILL be used against you if the Pigs want to. I
could send you copies of the many favorable reports on U4Euh including the
basic four-page brochure if I have your assurance they will not be
published and will not fall into the hands of the Pigs. I am going to make
what you will consider an outrageous suggestion: the next time you get a
pure sample of it, try some. Only then will you know. Read the comments
about it in the Winter 1987 Whole Earth Review.
    The title was clever, but how did it get the name Ice? I KNOW how it
got the name U4Euh. This is a photocopy, made on a public machine, and was
handled using gloves. The envelope was sealed and the stamp applied using
water, not identifiable saliva.

    - The Friendly Stranger

    The long letter regarding U4Euh printed in Whole Earth Review (no. 59,
Summer 1988) was in response to their previous Winter 1987 piece by "R. U.
Sirius" of High Frontiers magazine which accidentally (?) gave U4Euh the
chemical structure for another drug, MDA, which is dissimilar in effects.
    The nomenclature for U4Euh therein was given as 3,4-Methylenedimethoxy
Methamphetamine which the letter's author showed as "an impossible chemical
structure."
    Without stretching this point too far, other "points of fact" laid down
in the response letter included "like crystal methedrine, it is almost
certainly capable of precipitating paranoid psychosis," and "Finally, U4Euh
is relatively untested, both scientifically and on the street," and so on.
The implications of "brain damage, kidney damage, heart damage and liver
damage" continue the barrage. Here is the Friendly Stranger's unprinted
response to "May You Never Sleep - Cognition Enhancing Drugs" from The
Whole Earth Review.

        Feedback on Cognitive Activators from The Friendly Stranger

    I was one of the first half-dozen or so people to enjoy U4Euh. I also
named it. That's a brand name. Clever? I thought so.
   Someone else suggested the name Intellex.The description in the box is
TOTALLY incorrect. I doubt that R U. Sirius was guilty of so egregious an
error. If he was, he completely destroyed his credibility. U4Euh does NOT
fit the definition of "designer drug"; it was created decades before the
term was thought up, and it lay hidden in a journal article and patent.
Calling it a "stimulant" plays into the hands of DEA pigs and Nancy et al.
    Saying it is "chemically related to MDMA" is like saying that a Model T
Ford is structurally related to a Formula One Ferrari. U4Euh is related to
MDMA only in that both contain a benzene ring and are composed of Carbon,
Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen. There are tens, possibly hundreds, of
thousands of compounds which fit that description. It IS similar to
Pemoline. No, I am NOT going to reveal its exact molecular structure or
chemical name. Why should I?
    I feel somewhat like the way John Sutter may have felt after word about
the discovery of gold leaked out. U4Euh was already out, in Florida, so it
was possibly only a matter of time. But my introduction of it at a major
gathering of free spirits, ax-hippies, "freaks," etc., to put it politely,
resulted in it getting out to California where the "baby birds" continued
to disobey instructions and take too much of it, unnecessarily winding up
at the Haight-Ashbury Clinic.
    The DEA pigs learned about it and it was Emergency Scheduled. Mea
Culpa. Partly. I did the best I could with what I knew at the time. If I
knew then what I know now, I would NOT have been so generous, would NOT
have identified it, and would have required that people take it in my
presence.
    My lack of academic credentials notwithstanding, I am attempting to be
a responsible researcher. If I used the term "professional," someone would
interpret that as "drug dealer," wouldn't they? It was the first time in
fifteen (15!) years that someone included descriptive literature with a
"new" substance. Obviously none of the several hundreds of four- page
brochures I gave out ever reached R U. Sirius. I requested written
feedback. When I got none, I had to demand it. "No more U4Euh until I get a
report. I have since prepared a generic experience report form.
    "It's not paranoia when they really ARE after you." After I got a nice
reply to my first letter to the leading psychopharmacological chemist, my
second letter to him was opened in the mail in the Post Office where I
mailed it. Three photocopied pages disappeared. He is too well known. DO
NOT print his name. He values his privacy. An audio tape from the editor of
a small circulation journal about psychedelics was "lost in the mail." And
never found, of course. I phoned (from a coin phone, of course!) the editor
of the J. Psychoactive Drugs and he told me he never got the letter I'd
sent him. No, it did NOT include that name in the address. I DO eventually
learn from my mistakes.
    I have also been ignored. I sent an info package to "a leading
authority in the field." No reply. I hand-delivered a similar package to
the Timothy Leary. No reply. I met the author of a well-known book about
LSD and we chatted and exchanged phone numbers. He didn't return my call. I
notified High times four�FOUR - 4!) times. Executive Editor Dean Latimer
told me they didn't want to know anything about it until it made the media
elsewhere. When it was Scheduled, I reminded them of my involvement with
it. "We already have a story about it." "You don't want any more
information??!" "No." Nothing has appeared in H.T.
    I was (unnecessarily, it turned out) concerned about possible long-term
harmful effects of it. An analog had caused a fatal disease but apparently
the difference in molecular structure eliminated this, for I have had NO
reports of any permanent negative effects. I should have gone out to CA,
gone into massive production, dumped all I could before it was Scheduled,
and converted the proceeds into Real Money� the kind that doesn't burn or
inflate - Gold and Silver. Now  that it's Scheduled, I am suddenly
committing a felony. somehow I doubt that the pigs would accept my
"grandfather clause" defense. Or the "religious sacrament" defense.
    So I consider Kevin Kelly, of the Whole Earth Review, naive: "I bet
there is a reputation to be made by a scientist who could lift this out of
the outlaw realm into controlled lab science." It all starts in the lab
(read the journals) and if it's any good, it gets out of the lab, and
eventually the pigs and Puritans outlaw it. Look at history. How many
compounds have been outlawed? As they say, "This is left as an exercise for
the student."
    Don't you remember when the Food and Drug Gestapo tried to require an
Rx to buy vitamins in bulk? They did achieve some Newspeak: Minimum Daily
Requirement became Recommended Daily Allowance. "Allowance," as if we are
children. Could it be they don't want people to be too healthy? As Pearson
and Shaw point out in Life Extension, the Social [in] Security System is
bankrupt and if people live longer it will only get more bankrupt. "They've
got the guns but we've got the numbers." And what are we doing with our
numbers? Nothing. Paying our taxes (what did Thoreau say?) and feeding a
Cancer. Fighting among ourselves, or sitting around, shrugging. Liberals
support the First Amendment but not the Right to Defend Oneself (as if an
ACLU membership card could stop a rapist) and Conservatives, vice versa. "I
don't want to waste my vote by voting Libertarian" so (maybe) you vote for
Tweedledee or Tweedledum, and when either of them wins by more than one
vote, your vote WAS wasted. Or "Don't vote; you just encourage them."
Although there appears to be much truth in "If voting could change The
System, voting would be illegal." Look whites happening to the Jury's Right
to Nullify the Law (the right to decide the law as well as the facts) which
goes back to ancient English common law. End of Sermon.
    My experiences with most of the "wonderful" substances described in the
article have been disappointing. And I'm not the only one. The "lines" are:
"the effects are subtle"; "You have to take it for months," and then when
you still don't notice any effect, "Well, you must be one of those people
who get no benefit from it." Remember "B vitamins will restore color to
grey hair?" Maybe not - you're probably too young. Now they admit it works
for only a very small percentage of people.

Regarding the following:

    Hydergine: I agree with an MD friend's opinion of it: "Only effect I
could detect was that it lightened my wallet." I said Goodbye to a Ben
Franklin. Yes, I would take it before surgery or some high-risk sport like
SCUBA diving or skiing (where I might be buried in an avalanche) for its
"the brain can survive without oxygen for thirty minutes instead of five"
benefit, but that's all.
    Deaner: "Subtle." Too subtle for me. I could probably drink it like
water but water costs less.
    Pemoline: It's surprising how different some close relatives can be
(But then, considering how different close human relatives can be, I
shouldn't be surprised). It lasted three or four hours and produced no
feeling of euphoria, just an annoying "busy" feeling in my head.
    Lecithin: It seemed to perk up the first time I used it and have
remained at that level. I use it with vegetable oil to cook eggs and
potatoes and onions.
    PRL 8-53: If you read Pearson carefully, he describes two peoples'
experiences with it. I doubt he's tried it. Lack of consistency of effects
is a major problem with substances. I haven't tried it yet, but if it does
work, WOW! What will the Pigs be able to say as a justification for
scheduling it? Maybe "It gives the people who take it an unfair advantage
over those who don't."
    One substance did produce a totally serendipitous effect on me. It.
reduced my sleep requirement from seven or eight hours to four hours, with
no detectable side effects. I woke fully refreshed and literally could not
sleep any longer. I SPECULATE, and I emphasize SPECULATE, that it altered
my acetylcholine level. What is it? Hah! I may be crazy, but I'm not
stupid. Maybe someday you'll get lucky and be approached by The Friendly
Stranger.
    Oh yes, the four-page brochure about U4Euh. Should I give you
permission to reprint it? What effect will that have? Probably encourage
people to seek it, and encourage every would-be bathtub chemist to come out
of the woodwork and possibly kill himself with the highly toxic compound

    This is an all-or-nothing offer: print every word of the above or none
at all. The Pigs won't sue you because I call them Pigs, and you wouldn't
capitalize ee cummings poetry, would you? So leave my capitals and spelling
AS IS. I'm still micturated off at your ancestors over a few reviews in the
Various Whole Earth Catalogs. "Don't confuse us with facts; we've already
made up our minds; that was a friend of mine who reviewed that."

    7-88


    From the community-at-large comes many interesting anecdotal accounts.
The following is excerpted from Psychedelic Monographs and Essays (Spring
1988) Letter section.
    
   ...Recently met someone who was distributing a drug called U4Euh or
Intellex at the 1986 Continental Rainbow Gathering in Pennsylvania. He gave
us a pile of brochures regarding this substance. Let me say that for the
record, his 'pushing' of this synthetic stimulant�an unholy
sacrament�created what many characterized as "severe problems." This
consequently was met with or followed by decidedly more negative feelings
than positive. Basically, when combined with LSD, too many bad, violent
trips occurred.
    I am in touch with key individuals and we would like to submit a review
regarding U4Euh as I understand you are considering running other
literature about U4Euh in a future issue. The general feeling was that the
Rainbow distributor engaged in widespread recklessness, irresponsibility
and casual experimentation which some saw as a "disaster." However, I
personally thought that the literature being distributed by this person was
"excellent to brilliant."

    Here is The Friendly Stranger's response:

    I am tempted to claim that The Fnendly Stranger and U4Euh never
happened; we were all a mass hallucination caused by overdoses of LSD.
"Drug" is a "four-letter word" and using the term plays into the hands of
DEA and other pigs and Nancy et al. Ditto "stimulant." I did not "push"
U4Euh. I offered it. If I "pushed" anything, I pushed information. People
were Free To Choose. As for "synthetic", I am so tired of "natural",
"organic" nuts and flakes who refuse to accept facts. A molecule is the
same whether it is created in a plant or animal or in laboratory glassware.
LSD is semi-synthetic and strychnine is natural. Does that mean that LSD is
bad and strychnine is good? Who the Hell are you (or is ANYONE) to declare
U4Euh (or ANYTHING) "unholy"?? Bigotry is why religious wars occur. It is
virtually impossible to completely foolproof anything. Foolproof: to make
proof against fools. Only a complete fool takes ANYTHING for the first time
WITH something else, ESPECIALLY with something as powerful as LSD. Thank
you for the compliment re the literature. We (mostly I) put a lot of effort
into it. It's not my fault that Damn Fool Baby Birds refused to read it. At
the start, I made certain people understood it and I quizzed them, but I
was eventually inundated by requests. THEY were the ones who "engaged in
widespread recklessness, irresponsibility and casual experimentation which
some saw as a 'disaster'". I must admit I don't remember you. There were so
many camps. Where was yours?

    The Friendly Stranger


    Two pertinent and even more recent papers from the medical and legal
communities also should be included regarded U4Euh. These are in complement
to the list given by The New Age Chemist, which focuses more on tracing
early references and this compound's creation in the early 1960s.

    The first document is the Department of Justice (DEA) scheduling report
which made U4Euh (called therein 2-Amino- 4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline)
illegal on August 13, 1987. This three-page, single-spaced report reviews
the legal ramifications of the original 1984 CSA (Controlled Substances
Act) which allows for the DEA to place, in emergency situations pertaining
to imminent public safety, any old or new drug or compound, or chemically
based object or living thing, onto Schedule 1, as was done with U4Euh at
that time. This paper also reviews some of the initial findings taken from
the primary sources listed in The New Age Chemist's piece, plus detailed
reports of illegal labs as well as the report of one death related to
U4Euh. The complete title of this paper is: 21 CUR Part 1308; Schedules of
Controlled Substances; Temporary Placement of 2-Amino-4-methyl-5-phenyl-
2-oxazoline (4-methyl- Aminorex) Into Schedule 1; 52 FR 30174; August 13, 1987.

Section, DEA, Washington, D.C. 20537; 20537; telephone 1-202-633-1366.

    The Journal of Forensic Sciences more recently printed a piece called A
Fatality Involving U4Euh, A Cyclic Derivative of Phenylpropanolamine by
Davis & Brewster, two Florida-based researchers. This appeared in the Vol.
33, No. 2, March 1988 edition. The brief abstract presented is as follows:

    A fatality involving ingestion of diazepan and 4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-
    5-phenyl-2-oxazoline, a cyclic derivative of phenylpropanolamine known
    as U4Euh were analyzed using gas chromatography, ultraviolet and
    infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass
    spectrometry. Physiologic fluids were analyzed quantitatively by gas
    chromatography and qualitatively by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry.
    Concentrations of 4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine were: in
    blood: 21.3 mg./L.; in urine 12.3 mg./L Diazepam concentration in blood
    was 0.8 mg./L.

    It is certain that as this substance U4Euh becomes more well-known,
further scientific and underground publishing will be the result. Having
whatever facts-of-the-matter exist so far as published information seems
the proper prerequisite for any intelligent survey of U4Euh and its future
modifications.
