        <p><i>This first part won't be of any use to the non-Americans, but there
          are probably enough American bees out there to keep it from being a
          waste of time. I hope that a lot of people can benefit from the &quot;how
          to buy&quot; parts in the second half of this message, no matter what
          their nationality. On with the show!</i></p>

        <h2>Where the pigs are</h2>
        <p>The US federal regulations relating to the purchase of chemicals and
          laboratory equipment/glassware are not difficult to find, but more than
          a bit ambiguous when you do find them. I've been surfing the web for
          a few days now, and have found many interesting things. Some of you
          probably know this stuff. Others probably don't. For those that don't,
          here's my compilation:</p>
        <p>First, let's look at what the DOJ means by List I and List II chemicals.
          This is in 21USC Sec. 802. That's the US Code, and you can search and
          read it yourself at <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aaces002.html">http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aaces002.html</a></p>
        <hr>
        <p>From the US Code, current as of 1998:</p>
        <p> (33) The term ``listed chemical'' means any list I chemical or any
          list II chemical.</p>
        <p> (34) The term ``list I chemical'' means a chemical specified by regulation
          of the Attorney General as a chemical that is used in manufacturing
          a controlled substance in violation of this subchapter and is important
          to the manufacture of the controlled substances, and such term includes
          (until otherwise specified by regulation of the Attorney General, as
          considered appropriate by the Attorney General or upon petition to the
          Attorney General by any person) the following:</p>

          (H) Phenylacetic acid, its esters, and its salts.<br>
          (I) Phenylpropanolamine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical
          isomers.<br>
          (J) Piperidine and its salts.<br>
          (K) Pseudoephedrine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical
          isomers.<br>
          (L) 3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone.<br>
          (M) Methylamine.<br>
          (N) Ethylamine.<br>
          (O) Propionic anhydride.<br>
          (P) Isosafrole.<br>
          (Q) Safrole.<br>
          (R) Piperonal.<br>
          (S) N-Methylephedrine.<br>
          (T) N-methylpseudoephedrine.<br>
          (U) Hydriodic acid.<br>
          (V) Benzaldehyde.<br>
          (W) Nitroethane.<br>
          (X) Any salt, optical isomer, or salt of an optical isomer of the chemicals
          listed in subparagraphs (M) through (U) of this paragraph.</p>
        <p> (35) The term ``list II chemical'' means a chemical (other than a
          list I chemical) specified by regulation of the Attorney General as
          a chemical that is used in manufacturing a controlled substance in violation
          of this subchapter, and such term includes (until otherwise specified
          by regulation of the Attorney General, as considered appropriate by
          the Attorney General or upon petition to the Attorney General by any
          person) the following chemicals:</p>
        <p> (A) Acetic anhydride.<br>
          (B) Acetone.<br>
          (C) Benzyl chloride.<br>
          (D) Ethyl ether.<br>
          (E) Repealed. Pub. L. 101-647, title XXIII, Sec. 2301(b), Nov. 29, 1990,
          104 Stat. 4858.<br>

          (H) Toluene.<br>
          (I) Iodine.<br>
          (J) Hydrochloric gas.</p>

        <p><i>[back to igor]</i></p>
        <p>That's it for the definitions of what constitutes a List I or a List
          II chemical. Analysis of further information follows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Wholesalers/retailers are required to obtain a DEA permit if they
            are going to be selling any listed chemicals. The DEA is, not surprisingly,
            particularly uptight about primarily mail order businesses. In order
            to get a permit a business owner must fill out an application for
            a DEA permit specifically listing the controlled chemicals he or she
            wishes to sell. This application is sent to the main DEA office for
            processing, and if it is pre approved then a DEA agent will visit
            the owner/company to review the application, evaluating the personality,
            facilities, professionalism and abilities of the owner/company, and
            advising the owner/company about potential hazards and problems with
            selling the listed chemicals. After all this, the DEA still has to
            approve you; it doesn't mean that you're going to magically get a
            permit.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>A company should never apply to sell listed chemicals that do not
            directly relate to their stated business; they can, but the DEA will
            look long and hard before approving it. The fewer listed chemicals
            you want to sell, the better off you are. Also, there are more than
            a few stupid people who apply for permits just so they can buy ephedrine
            (or whatever) to divert for personal use. Very, very, very bad idea.
            A DEA agent on the West Coast told a friend that this is not uncommon,
            and that the DEA will see right through you. It's one of the things
            they're looking for when they do their little pre approval interview.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> They seem to focus heavily on PPA, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine
            in their regulation of precursors. This means that they care a lot
            about methamphetamine (perhaps because it's cheap to make and so immensely
            popular in this country), but don't seem to be quite as tuned in to
            the manufacture of other amphetamines or phenethylamines. THIS DOES
            NOT MEAN THAT THEY WON'T BUST YOU FOR MAKING MDMA, MESCALINE OR 2C-B!!
            They will, and they'll probably send a dozen jackbooted and<br>
            heavily armed thugs to harass you while the guys in protective suits
            are walking around bagging your hexamine and two gallons of sassafras
            oil (what the FUCK were you thinking when you bought that, anyway?)
            All I'm saying is that I think you're safer if you don't try buying
            any of the List I or II chemicals, ESPECIALLY ephedrine, pseudoephedrine
            and PPA. There are regulations regarding<br>
            the quantities that dictate when something should be reported. If
            you're small scale then you probably won't hit these thresholds in
            a month anyway, even with List I stuff, but don't push it. No sane
            person would sell List I's to you anyway, and they would quite reasonably
            be very careful about List II stuff.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Distributors are REQUIRED BY LAW to report any suspicious activity
            or purchases. The government has no specific regulations on exactly
            what constitutes &quot;suspicious,&quot; but the DEA suggests the
            following as a starting point. From the DEA's DMCA FAQ at <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/diverson/divreg/divchhp.htm">http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/diverson/divreg/divchhp.html</a></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>&quot;The reporting of a suspicious order is required by the Controlled
          Substances Act and is of primary importance to DEA in limiting the availability
          of listed chemicals in the illicit traffic. Each regulated person is
          most familiar with its customers and the circumstances surrounding the
          orders it processes. The chemical industry must use its best judgment
          in identifying suspicious orders.<br>
          The following are provided in order to assist the industry in identifying
          suspicious orders:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>An individual who desires to pay cash and wants to pick up the chemical(s).</li>
          <li>An established customer who deviates from previous orders or ordering
            methods.</li>
          <li>A new customer or unfamiliar representative of an established customer
            who orders listed chemicals.</li>
          <li>A customer who has difficulty in pronouncing chemical names.</li>
          <li>A customer who is vague about its firm's address, telephone number,
            and reason for desiring a listed chemical.</li>
          <li>A customer who wants a listed chemical shipped to a post office
            box or address other than the usual business address.</li>
          <li>A customer who prefers to pay by cashier's check, postal money order,
            etc.</li>
          <li>A customer who will not furnish references or who is vague about
            furnishing references for credit purposes.</li>
          <li>A customer who desires listed chemicals for reasons at variance
            with accepted legitimate industry practice.</li>
          <li>A customer who is not a member of a trade, professional, or business
            association.</li>
          <li>A customer who furnishes false or suspicious addresses, telephone
            numbers, or references.</li>
          <li>A customer who refuses or is reluctant to establish a credit account
            or provide purchase order information.</li>
          <li>A customer whose communication either by telephone, mail, or other
            means is not conducted or prepared in a professional business manner.</li>
          <li>A customer who requests unusual methods or routes of shipment or
            who provides unusual shipping, labeling or packaging instructions.</li>
          <li>A customer who purchases unusual quantities or combinations of chemicals
            or glassware in contrast with customary practice and usage.</li>
          <li>A customer whose stated use of listed chemicals is incompatible
            with destination country's commercial activities or consignee's line
            of business.</li>
          <li>A customer with little or no business background information available.</li>
          <li>A customer using a freight forwarder as ultimate consignee.</li>
          <li>The use of intermediate consignee(s) whose location or business
            is incompatible with the purported end user's nature of business or
            location.]</li>
          <li>Evasive responses to any questions, or responses that indicate a
            lack of basic knowledge of the industry, or inability to supply information
            on whether listed chemicals are for domestic use or export.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>As you can see, a lot of stuff can be suspicious. If you're going to
          buy stuff from a distributor then don't be a stupid jerk. Meet these
          requirements so you won't screw it up for the rest of the people ordering
          from them. For example, if you shiftily ask for large quantities of
          acetamide, and want to pay cash, then a smart source will report it.
          (If they don't, and if they OR you are caught, they could face a sentence
          of up to 20 years in prison for what the DOJ perceives as their recklessness.)
          So they report it, the DEA comes knocking on your door, and then they
          might do an audit of the supplier because he was stupid enough to sell
          it to you.</p>
        <p>Or say you were smart enough to be professional and cooperative with
          the chemical supplier, but the DEA busts up your lab and finds receipts
          (credit card statement, purchase order, invoice, whatever) tying you
          back to that supplier. Well, guess what? You might have just fucked
          several unwitting bees who were smart enough to be inconspicuous to
          the business owner, but who are still on file at that business as having
          purchased potentially suspicious chemicals. Thanks a lot, dumbass. There
          will be a long line of angry bees waiting outside your cell to hit you
          with a lead pipe once you're inside. And I hope that you enjoy being
          brutally raped by psychopaths who are mildly bitter about facing a lifetime
          incarceration.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>More Advice on the Act of Buying Stuff</h2>
        <p>Many of the chemical/glassware companies that sell to private individuals
          realize that some (many?) of their customers are buying stuff for use
          in clandestine drug manufacture. They probably don't want to report
          you. Don't give them a reason to. In fact, try to make them think that
          it was insane of them to ever suspect you in the first place. (&quot;He
          was such a nice boy!&quot;)</p>
        <p>Be courteous, knowledgeable and professional on the telephone. Burn
          your receipts. Scrape labels off of chemical bottles and burn them,
          too. Dispose of containers where no one will ever pay attention to them,
          like in a dumpster in the city public use landfill. (But be environmentally
          conscious at the same time.) Be smart about receiving chemicals. You
          know the drill. Don't fuck it up for everyone else. This is not a joke.
          By being careless, you could inadvertently send a bunch of people to
          jail, not the least of which being the guy who owns the chemical supply
          business. See Dick Drug. See Dick Fuck Up. See Dick Die at the hands
          of Bubba the Child Molester. Don't be a Dick.</p>
        <p>What do I think about buying chemicals? The best advice I've found
          is by POPeye, and it is archived at Rhodium's site:</p>
        <p><a href="popeye/popeye.zwit.txt">chemistry/popeye/popeye.zwit.txt</a></p>
        <p>I am totally, irrationally paranoid about being caught, and I usually
          proceed accordingly. Here's the trade-off: provide as few clues as possible
          to your real identity, but remain inconspicuous. For what it's worth,
          I might not have any experience with the actual manufacture of drugs,
          but dammit, I have bought so much stuff (some of it suspicious, and
          some of it from big time suppliers, too, not just the companies that
          sell to individuals) that I have a good bit of experience pulling off
          my purchases.</p>
        <p>All you have to do is apply some common sense to what you're doing,
          and know enough about your reputed subject to fool the average person
          taking and filling the orders at a chemical supply company. Know how
          to pronounce a chemical before you ask for it. Know correct pronunciations
          of words like &quot;isomer&quot;, &quot;carbonyl&quot;, &quot;claisen
          adapter&quot; and &quot;ketone.&quot; This shit comes up. Seriously.</p>
        <p>Be able to spout off your SSN, driver's license number, street address,
          business name/phone/address, birth date, etc., immediately upon being
          asked. And don't just make them up on the spot. Have them (fake or real,
          whatever) memorized. If you're picking up in person, print up some business
          cards and take them along with your PO and fake ID.</p>
        <p>Other things: when purchasing chemicals, don't let on that you know
          anything about the processes related to clandestine manufacture. Pick
          a legitimate area of organic/medical chemistry or chemical engineering
          research -- how about pesticides, improved delivery of orally administered
          drugs, solubility variations with temperature and pressure? Know where
          you got &quot;your&quot; under-graduate degree and maybe &quot;your&quot;
          graduate degree. Know when &quot;you&quot; graduated. And don't pick
          a big school, either. Pick a smaller university in another part of the
          country, because if you don't, then Murphy's Law says that the person
          to whom you are speaking will have attended the same big school that
          you did, and<br>
          will ask something about the campus, faculty or town that you won't
          be able to answer. Even better, pick some place that you have visited
          and with which you are relatively familiar. If you used to date a guy
          who went to Podunk State University in Southern Kansas, then PSU-SK
          sounds like a great chemistry department for you.</p>
        <p>Did you learn a really believable Australian accent by watching Paul
          Hogan, a good Massachusetts accent from old videotapes of JFK, or a
          great Belfast accent from your granny? Hmm. That might be useful. But
          if you're going international, you'd better know something about where
          &quot;you&quot; came from, then. Referring to a Scottish or Irish person
          as English could cause him to put his fist down your throat. Koreans
          are not Chinese. Perth is on the west coast of Australia, Sydney and
          Melbourne are on the east. People who live in San Francisco will often
          call SF &quot;the city&quot; in conversation. Cambridge and Boston are
          not the same town. Orange County is not LA, at least not to people who
          live in LA. Dallas and Fort Worth have individual identities; people
          in Forth Worth DO NOT live in Dallas, and God help you if you think
          otherwise. The Netherlands is a country, not a region. Ukrainians are
          not Russian. Pakistan and India are not the same country.</p>
        <p>Be friendly, loose and confident, but don't be too talkative. If you've
          volunteered all of this information before they've even asked you to
          name your first item, they're going to be suspicious. If it comes up
          in conversation while they're processing your order, great. If you can
          laugh, or you can make them<br>
          laugh, great, but leave the subject matter as something that isn't particularly
          memorable. Stay away from any kind of conversation about controlled
          substances, even if you're just joking around or poking fun at &quot;those
          fools trying to make drugs.&quot; If they bring it up, say something
          appropriately disdainful about &quot;those fools.&quot; For example,
          if you're standing in front of the person, you might roll<br>
          your eyes and say &quot;yeah, sometimes I think that the gene pool could
          use a little chlorine.&quot; Whatever you do, don't take the opportunity
          to get on your soapbox and wax poetic about the unfairness of our ridiculous
          War on Drugs. If you do: BING BING BING! Red flag. Just hope that they
          don't call the police while you're waiting for your acetic acid, 2.5L
          of hexane, and your condenser.</p>
        <p>For walk in purchases, try to be inconspicuous. Wear something nondescript.
          A polo shirt and khakis. Button down shirt and slacks with a subtle
          tie. A fairly plain sweater and skirt. Try not to have the mascot of
          the some distant university on your jacket, or a &quot;I Took Second
          Place in the Main Street 5K Run!&quot; t-shirt. If you're going to shave
          your beard, cut or color your hair, or get new glasses, maybe this is
          a great time to stock up on potassium hydroxide, LAH and hydrochloric
          acid.</p>
        <p>Let's say that, God forbid, you are forced into conversation. (This
          happens a lot for walk in business, not so much for telephone purchases.)
          Little things mean a lot in conversation, especially if someone wants
          to be suspicious of you. DO NOT go looking for conversation. Be polite,
          be friendly, but get the fuck in and then get the fuck out. This includes
          both telephone conversations and walk in. If you are forced into conversation,
          and the opportunity is presented, take an opportunity to mention how
          many non-standard ground glass stoppers you've accumulated in the stopper
          drawer at the lab. Bitch about an incompetent co-worker. Comment about
          how the inspection guy came around yesterday to check the fire extinguishers.
          Talk about the person you met on the ride up the office elevator that
          morning. Complain about how you're going to have to pay $2500 to have
          your rotovap replaced because one of the lab assistants pushed it off
          of the bench. Praise your graduate advisor for her tireless work in
          developing delivery mechanisms for antibacterial drugs. Etc. You get
          the idea.</p>
        <p>Developing a convincing and complicated lie is an art form. Practice.
          Know your entire fake life's history before you start using it. If you're
          married in your fake life, don't refer to your girlfriend, even if you're
          not at the same place. If you played soccer, don't talk about how you
          hate sports. Be consistent.</p>
        <p>So, IMHO, the most important things are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be calm, confident, consistent, professional and knowledgeable.
            It's no big deal for you to be buying THF, acetone, chloroform and
            250 ml boiling flasks. These are common fixtures in a lab, and you
            do this all the time. Really.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Know what you want. When you're out of something in a lab, you
            know what it is, you make a list, and you pick up the telephone and
            order it. You don't flip through a catalog going, &quot;and, um, some
            pentane, and... let's see, 500g of NaOH, and 50g of LAH... no, make
            that 250g of LAH....&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Spread out your business. If you simply must have all of the stuff
            to make a particular drug, and you must have it now, then buy from
            four or five different suppliers. This is just as suspicious if someone
            is watching you, but the suppliers don't usually communicate with
            each other, so they don't know to raise a red flag.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Don't be particularly memorable. Unless it's unavoidable, keep
            unnecessary chatter to a minimum, but don't be brusque, rude or dismissive.
            If you do talk, stay calm. Sound like you do in everyday<br>
            conversation. As a culture, Americans are very friendly and outgoing.
            So are Australians. Canadians and Europeans tend to be a bit more
            reserved. Educated people from Georgia are very polite, saying &quot;yes
            sir&quot; and &quot;no ma'am.&quot; People from New York are more
            abrupt but still professional. Fit the mold. Always fit the mold.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Have documentation. If they ask for your driver's license, you'd
            better have one. If they ask for a faxed PO, you'd better have a fax
            machine close by. Don't give them everything up front, but if they
            want it, don't be a jerk about it. <b>Be prepared.</b></li>
        </ul>
