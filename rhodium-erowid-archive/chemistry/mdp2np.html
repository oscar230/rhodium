<p>In Pihkal<a href="mdp2np.html#refs"><sup>1a</sup></a>, Alexander Shulgin mentions that the preparation of  3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-nitropropene can be carried out in cold methanol with aqueous sodium hydroxide as the base<a href="mdp2np.html#refs"><sup>1b,1c</sup></a>.
In fact, this method is even more reliable, and gives higher yields than the other method advocated by the dear doctor in his book.</p>

<p>15g of piperonal was dissolved in 40ml of methanol under stirring in a 250ml Erlenmeyer flask. When all of the piperonal had dissolved, 7.1g nitroethane was added to
the solution. The flask was put in a ice/salt-bath with magnetic stirring, and when the temperature of the solution had dropped to 0�C, an ice-cold solution of 4g of NaOH
in 20ml H<sub>2</sub>O was added at such a rate that the temperature never rose above 10�C. A white precipitate formed at the bottom of the flask during this addition, which was
broken up with a glass rod. The stirring was continued for another hour, while the temperature of the solution was never allowed to rise above 5�C, and at the end of this
time, 100 ml of ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O was added to the solution, which caused even more precipitation of white solid. The whole slurry was poured into 100 ml of ice-cold 2M HCl
solution in a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask, which was gently swirled, and there was a slight bubbling and fizzing, with the color of the solution shifting from white to blue to
green to yellow in under a minute. Quite spectacular! When the fizzing had subsided, the solution was once again placed in in an ice-bath with magnetic stirring. When the
temperature had dropped to about 5�C, the solution was clear with yellow granules of crude product at the bottom. The granules were filtered with suction, and
recrystallized from IPA. After air-drying, the canary-yellow crystals amounted to a yield of 65-70% of theory.</p>

<p>This nitropropene should be used within a week, or stored in the cold, as the color fades to a slight orange over a couple of weeks in room temperature, which is a sure sign of decomposition.</p>

<p>250 g piperonal is dissolved in 900 ml 95% EtOH and there is added 150 mls nitroethane, 10g methylamine hydrochloride and 8g sodium carbonate. After a brief stirring the
mixture is left in a dark place for 2 weeks. It is then poured into 7 L water, the precipitate filtered, washed with water and air-dried. Recrystallization from small qtties of EtOH. Yield 87%.</p>

<h4>2,5-Dimethoxynitrostyrene<a href="mdp2np.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a></h4>

<p>A mixture of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (1.97 g, 11.8 mmol) and nitromethane (0.72 g, 11.8 mmol) in methanol (200 mL) was stirred at room temperature until the solids dissolved. The solution was cooled to 0&deg;C and a 10.5 M NaOH solution (2 mL) was added dropwise over 20 min. The alkaline solution was added slowly to a 4% HCl solution (200 mL) maintained at 60&deg;C. The pale yellow amorphous solid that formed was filtered and washed with water (200 mL). The crude product was recrystallized from absolute ethanol to give yellow needles (2.11 g, 85%).</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of 10.5 M NaOH:</strong><br>
  With cooling, dissolve 10.5g sodium hydroxide in 20ml water, and at RT dilute the solution to exactly 25ml.</p>
