<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

          <p>This procedure describes an efficient, high-yielding and completely 
            OTC way of reducing virtually any nitrostyrene <strong>OR</strong> 
            phenyl-2-nitropropene using aluminium amalgam. </p>
          <p>Initially this approach to reducing nitroalkenes was pursued by <strong>SunLight</strong><a href="nitrostyrene.reduction.alhg.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> 
            based on an old German reference<a href="nitrostyrene.reduction.alhg.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, due to the suboptimal work-up strategy, 
            his results were far from ideal, which lead to this direction of research 
            being almost completely buried in vain.</p>
          <p>Luckily, some four years later an adventurous HyperLab Bee (who modestly 
            wished to remain anonymous) decided to once again take a look at this 
            procedure. His experiments ended in a complete and unquestionable 
            success!</p>
          <p>This news was privately communicated to certain reputable Hive and 
            HyperLab members (who also wished to keep their names private) in 
            order to verify the author's results. Very soon they also reported 
            a pronounced success with this reaction. <br>
          </p>

<h3>II. Experimental</h3>
<div class="exp">
<p>         <strong>#1: The original procedure by <em> Hyperlab Bee #1</em>.</strong></p>

            <p>Into a 3 liter kitchen jar.....yes, exactly :-). </p>
            <p>So... into a 3 liter kitchen jar there�s placed:</p>
            <p>- 75 mmoles of any nitrostyrene or phenylnitropropene (that should 
              bee ~20 g) <em>[Note 1]</em><br>
              - 200 mls GAA<br>
              - 300 mls IPA<br>
              - 100 mls water<br>
              - 0.75-1.3 g Hg(NO3)2 <em>[Note 2]</em></p>
            <p>Lastly, 40 g of kitchen Al foil is dumped into the soup.</p>
            <p>The suspension is incubated for 30-40 mins after which it assumes 
              black color and starts heating up.</p>
            <p>At this moment SWIM simply takes the whole shebang and shakes it 
              violently until the full dissolution of the nitro. At this point 
              the mixture is usually vigorously boiling and is so hot that it 
              can't bee held with bare hands.</p>
            <p>From that moment the reaction proceeds for 5-10 mins, leaving a 
              grey aluminous sludge as the result. The sludge is immediately dissolved 
              in 300 g KOH in 800 mls water (which makes the mixture again boil 
              so violently that the jar's bottom once fell off - after that we 
              switched to using plastic canisters). Surprisingly, this treatment 
              seems to not harm the product at all</p>
            <p>The result is a two-phase mixture, the upper layer being the desired 
              amine in IPA.</p>
            <p>The procedure has been tested multiple times on the nitroalkenes 
              corresponding to TMA-2, TMA-6 and 2C-H. It always gave yields not 
              less than 70%. <em>[Note 3]</em></p>
            <p><em>[Note 1]</em>: the nitroalkene must bee purified (rextallization 
              from IPA) as much as possible. Using dirty nitroalkenes results 
              in a sharp drop in yield.</p>
            <p><em>[Note 2]</em>: the actual quantity of mercuric salt was never 
              accurately measured - SWIM just added it at the tip of the knife.</p>
            <p><em>[Note 3]</em>: The lowest yield thus far was 12 mls of 2C-H 
              freebase from 20 g of 2,5-diMeO-nitrostyrene.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
          <p><strong>#2: The experimental trials by <em>Hive Bee #1</em>.</strong></p>

            <p>A 3-necked 2L RB was equiped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic 
              stirbar. The setup was charged with 100 mL GAA, 50 mL H2O and 150 
              mL IPA. The mixture was stirred and 1.0 g Hg(II) chloride was added. 
              When all salt was dissolved, 10.0 g 4-methoxyphenyl-2-nitropropene 
              was added.</p>
            <p>21 g Al foil was ripped in small pieces (ca 1 x 3 cm) which were 
              pressed (not firmly) into bals. When the nitropropene went into 
              solution, the Al foil was added one ball after the other. The initially 
              yellow solution colours greenish with a hint of black, and as the 
              reaction proceeds, changes to a unattractive grey. All Al is added 
              over a 30 min period. This prevents the reaction mixture from overheating. 
              Alot of heat is produced during the reaction... When I noticed that 
              gas evolution and bubbling of the slurry had stopped, I decided 
              to add another 100 mL GAA (2 x 50 mL). This restarted the reaction.</p>
            <p>About 90 minutes after addition of the Al, the reaction mixture 
              was treated with aqueous NaOH: first with 150 g NaOH in 400 mL water, 
              followed by 75 g NaOH in 200 mL water and by 50 g NaOH in 150 mL 
              water. This reaction is very exothermic, so beware... When all aqueous 
              NaOH was added, there were two phases, viz a clear orange upper 
              layer with IPA smell and the Al sludge. The orange layer was isolated 
              and diluted with aqueous HCl (20 mL conc HCl + 80 mL H2O). The mixture 
              was extracted with DCE (2 x 40 mL). The organic layer had a red 
              colour, while the aqueous phase had a yellow appearance. The latter 
              was made alkaline with 5 M NaOH solution and extracted with 100 
              mL chloroform. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium 
              sulfate and the solvent removed under reduced pressure and recuperated. 
              This yielded 5.9 g of an amber oil.</p>
            <p><strong>Yield: 69.9%</strong><br></p>

          <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

            <p>I have had the impression that impure nitropropene does have a 
              negative influence on the yields, as was stated by <em> HyperLab 
              Bee #1 </em>as well. I have tried TMA yesterday, and yields were 
              awful. The starting nitropropene, however, was far from pure. Today, 
              I tried a new 4-MA batch with impure starting product; 20.0 g 4-methoxyphenyl-2-nitropropene 
              yielded 5.0 g freebase after the workup I previously described. 
              However, my end products have always been very pure.</p>
            <p>I made a small modification, however. Of the 40 g Al that I added, 
              there was only 5 g made available for the reaction start. Once the 
              reaction started (in a violent way), the reaction was maintained 
              by gradually adding all Al, each additiopn being accompanied by 
              another small portion of Hg salt. This way, there was no solvent 
              loss via the reflux condenser. Also, when no more fumes escaped 
              from the top of the condenser, additional GAA was added. This did 
              not restart the reaction, even though some Al was clearly left unreacted.</p>

            #3. Reduction of 3,4-methylenedioxy-P2NP by <em>Hive Bee #2</em>.</strong></p>

            <p>55 g recrystallized 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl-2-nitropropene was 
              dissolved in a warm solution of 600 mls HOAc and 1000 mls IPA in 
              a 5Liter flask with magnetic stirring and heating mantle. 1 g HgCl2 
              dissolved in 300 mls H2O was added and mixture was brought up to 
              60 �C. A total of 90 grams of regular thickness kitchen aluminum 
              foil was shredded by folding a sheet in half(doubling it over) and 
              running it through a cross-cut paper shredder. This was added in 
              20 gram portions at a rate which kept the temperature at approx 
              70 �C for the entire rxn. Mag stirring was not impeded by using 
              foil of this type and the rxn was over in about 4 hours. 1000 mls 
              50% NaOH soln was added at a rate which prevented boiling over, 
              phases separated and the liquified Al/NaOAc phase was tapped off 
              leaving a light orange IPA soln organic layer in the funnel. IPA 
              was stripped off at the rotovap leaving behind a thick deep red 
              oil which smelled of amine. Acid/base cleanup resulted in a dark 
              red oil which was not suitable for crystallization. Oil was distilled 
              (105-108�C, 1.5 mmHg) to <strong>yield 32 grams (approx. 65% 
              yield)</strong> of water-white MDA base.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
            <p>Experiments were performed on 50 g substrate<br>
              1) HOAc reduced to 500 ml, Al was reduced to 60 g. Yield = 24 g 
              MDA base</p>
            <p>2) HOAc reduced to 500 ml and 100 g aluminum was divided into three 
              portions of 33 g which were added as the previous increment was 
              consumed. <br>
              Yield = 35 g MDA base.<br>

  <p><strong>#4. Reduction of unsubstituted P2NP by <em>HyperLab Bee #2</em>.</strong><br>
    </p>

            <p>Into a 3-L FBF there was placed 100 mls water, 250mls GAA and a 
              solution of 1g mercury in 2-3 mls conc. HNO3. <br>
              52 g (2 packs 10 meters each) of Al foil were folded into 7-8 layers, 
              cut in pieces 3x3 cm and loaded into the flask. <br>
              The flask was heated to 40 �C. When the start of amalgamation 
              was clearly visible in several minutes, heating was discontinued 
              and into the reaction there was added a suspension of 30 g <strong><em>non-recrystallized</em></strong> 
              phenyl-2-nitropropene in a mixture of 50 mls GAA and 100mls IPA 
              (nitropropene was obtained <em><strong>a la Barium�s MeAm condensation</strong> 
              - </em> an important notion since this method gives the product 
              of superior purity).</p>
            <p>The next 5-7 minutes the reaction proceeded rather smoothly... 
              I only turned away from it for some half a minute... and when I 
              turned around once again I saw that the mixture inside the flask 
              tries to surpass the last inches of the flask�s neck! Grabbing the 
              flask I rushed to the sink..... and then..... it was like as if 
              I was standing on Baikonur�s starting table trying to hold back 
              the rocket-launcher �Soyuz� during its blastoff.... The reactive 
              stream of "exhaust gasses" � hydrogen and IPA vapours 
              - was quite something.</p>
            <p>Thanks goodness, cooling helped and the foam only slightly escaped 
              the flask. The fireworks lasted for a minute or two, after which 
              the flask was placed into a cold water bath for 15 mins and its 
              contents were periodically shaken by hand. Cooling was removed and 
              the reaction was allowed to stand for another 40-50 minutes. At 
              first the temperature held itself at 85 � spontaneously, then a 
              little heating had to bee applied.</p>
            <p>The obtained grey porridge in which there still was some unreacted 
              aluminium was cooled and cautiously basified with 500 g KOH in 500mls 
              water. Two layers formed: the lower, aqueous, with some unreacted 
              hydroxides and the upper, consisting of IPA and the product. The 
              mixture was extracted with 2x150 mls ether, the pooled extracts 
              dryed and the solvent stripped off at rotovap. 25 g of crude amphetamine 
              base was obtained as a muddy (inorganics) liquid of skin color.</p>
            <p>It was vacuum distilled with a short column. 1st fraction � 0.8g, 
              b.p. 67-72 C/6 mmHg, 2nd fraction � the product, 20.8 g, b.p.72 
              C. And this is despite heating with a gas flame, instead of a bath!</p>
            <p>So, the <strong>yield was 20.8g (83.5%) </strong>of a crystally 
              clean product. And if we are to count the 1st fraction, from which 
              a goodly amount of a colorless sulfate was later made, we get a 
              yet higher figure. Moreover, a certain quantity of amphetamine was 
              lost in rotovap � the bath�s temperature was 80 �� and vacuum 
              � around 20 �C. In the morning it formed white granules of carbonate 
              on the rotor�s walls.</p>
            <p>In addition I want to note that the quantity of foil used can bee 
              evidently less as it doesn�t react fully anyway. I think 30-35 g 
              should bee enough.</p>
            <p>Another note � I researched a little the reaction of Al foil with 
              various proportions of water:IPA:GAA and it appears that the originally 
              used mixture gives the fastest reaction rate. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Well, that's it. I'm throwing all my LAH into the trashcan tomorrow 
              morning :-)</p></div>
