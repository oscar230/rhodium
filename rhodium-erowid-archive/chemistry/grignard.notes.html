<h3>Grignard reactions in solvents other than ether</h3>
<p>From Grignard Reactions of Non-metallic Substances, by M.S. Kharasch and Otto Reinmuth (1954)</p>

  <p>"Tertary Amines. Tschelinzeff<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>146</sup></a> remarked 
    the simarity betwwen the reactions of Grignard reagents with many oxygen compounds, 
    on the one hand and their nitrogen analogs, on the other hand, e.g. water 
    and ammonia, alcohols and amines (primary and secondary), ketones and nitriles, 
    esters and amides. From this he reasoned that the nitrogen analog of an ether 
    (e.i. a tertiary amine) might well play the same role as an ether in the preparation 
    of a grignard reagent." [In short this worked. Specificly he speaks of dimethylaniline.<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
  <p>"Hydrocarbons. ...Tschelinzeff149 attempted the preparation of of Grignard 
    reagents from a series of iodides (not specified) in benzene, both thiophene-free 
    and thiophene contaminated, but noted no preceptible reaction after forty-eight 
    hours at the boiling point. In xylene, he was able to prepare reagents from, 
    ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, and n-amyl iodides without the use of a "catalyst".</p>

  <p>When a few drops of a tertiary amine (suitable dimethylaniline) was added 
    such preparations could be carried out in benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, 
    petroleum ether, benzine, and terpenoid hydrocarbons. Reaction often begin 
    spontaneously, but always could be initiated by warming to 30-40 , or by adding 
    a crystal of iodine.... Simialr tertiary amine promoted Grignard reagents 
    preparations in hydrocarbon solvents are described b Tschelinzeff<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>150</sup></a>, by Stadnikoff<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>151</sup></a>, 
    and Hess and Rheinboldt<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>152</sup></a>. </p>
  <p>...A comparative study of the effectiveness of various ethers and their sulfur 
    analogs in facilitating Grignard reagent formation in benzene solution has 
    been made by Hepworth<a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>156</sup></a>.... In general oxygen compounds are much more effective 
    thantheir sulfur analogs. Open-chain compounds are more effective than the 
    related hetrocycles: e.g. ethyl n-propyl ether is more effective than pentamethylene 
    oxide; ethyl n-propyl sulfide is more effective than pentamethylene sulfide... 
  </p>
  <p>Gilman and McCracken<abbr title="Rec. Trav. Chim., 46, 463-72, (1927)"><a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>157</sup></a></abbr> 
    have reviewed earlier work on the preparation of Grgnard reagents in solvents 
    other than ethyl ether, and have investigated the effect on Grignard yields 
    of various hydrocarbon-ethyl ether mixtures. They conclude that in general, 
    the use of a mixed solvent results in a drop in yeild of about 10% below that 
    obtained with the optmum ethyl ether concentration.</p>

  <p>Barr'e and Repentigny<abbr title="Can. J. Research, 27B, 716-20, (1949)"><a href="grignard.notes.html#refs"><sup>160</sup></a></abbr> 
    describe the preparation of several Grignard reagents in hydrocarbon solvents 
    with dimethylaniline as "catalyst".</p>

  <p><strong>&quot;TABLE II-XII: <br>
    Preparations Of Several Griganrd Reagents In Hydrocarbon Solvents With The 
    Aid Of Dimethylaniline</strong></p>

  <p>Benzyl chloride in refluxing benzene (14h, 80ï¿½C) with the addition of 1.25g 
    PhNMe<sub>2</sub> as catalyst results in a 20-30% yield of Benzyl Magnesium Chloride, 
    but the Benzyl Chloride also quaternizes to some extent; neither allyl bromide 
    nor t-butyl chloride give appreciable yeilds of Grignard reagent."</p>

  <p><strong>Also, concerning ketone formation by Grignard reagent addition to 
    an excess of acid halide...</strong></p>

<p>"'The order of activity of the three acid halides, benzoyl flouride, chloride, and bromide,...Since the acid flouride is actually found to be the most reactive, it is
obvious that the reaction occurs through addition to the carbonyl group not through a metathetical reaction of the halogen atom...</p>

<p>It may or may not be significant in this connection that the order of reactivity of acyl halides toward the organoainc, -cadmium, and -mercury compounds (Which do not
under go carbonyl double bond addition, which is very slowly indeed) is said to be the reverse of that toward Grignard reagents...</p>

<p><strong>Preparation Of Ketones By Grignard-Halide Interaction</strong></p>

  <p>For that purpose low operating tempatures, reverse adition (i.e. addition 
    of the Grignard reagent to the acid chloride, or it's solution), and the use 
    of an excess of the acid chloride are obviously indicated. The reaction has 
    indeed been employed by, amoung others, Gilman et al<a href="grignard.notes.html#ref2"><sup>13</sup></a>,

<p>When applicable, however, the organozinc halides or the diorganocadmium, compounds give superior results.
</p>
  <p><strong>Ketone Preparation With The Aid Of Zinc And Cadmium Salts</strong></p>

<p>The advantage claimed for the use of organocadmium compounds are: that they are readily prepared form from
Grignard reagents and the relativly economical, nonhydroscoopic cadmium chloride; that the preparation and subsequent reaction can be carried out in ether solution
(although benzene, or toluene is preferred solvent for acid chloride reactions); that, although they react readily with acid chloride and acid anhydrides, they are are
very unreactive towards other functional groups (including the carbonyl) that react more or less readily with Grignard reagents. The R<sub>2</sub>Cd and RCdX compounds appear to be
equally satisfac- tory, but the former are most often used as requiring less cadmium chloride.</p>

  <p>The Organozinc compounds are similar in chemical properties to the corresponding 
    organocadmium compounds, but notwithstanding the recommondations of Blaise<a href="grignard.notes.html#ref2"><sup>25</sup></a>, 
    who gives no experimental detail, are alleged to to be comparatively disadvant- 
    ageous because of greater difficultly of preparation; the undesireableity 
    of using ether as a solvent in acid chloride reactions )because of ether cleavage 
    and ester formation); and the geatwerreactivity of the zinc compounds particularly 
    towards carbonyl groups. ...It is possible, however, to affect the preparation 
    by a method analogous to that commonly employed for the preparation of organocadmium 
    compounds, namely, the addition of anhydrous zinc chloride to a Grignard reagent 
    solution, a method that has been used with good sucess by Jones<a href="grignard.notes.html#ref2"><sup>27</sup></a> 
    and others."</p>
