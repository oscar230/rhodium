 <h3>Abstract</h3>

The reactivity of new formylating agents related to formamide has been investigated both
experimentally and theoretically. The reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane between
tris(diformylamino)methane (2) and several arenes, catalyzed by AlCl3 or BCl3, was shown to
proceed in good yields to afford the corresponding para-substituted aldehydes. The nature of the
active electrophilic species was also investigated theoretically. Thus, the relative stability of the O-
and N-protonated forms, as well as those of AlCl<sub>3</sub> adducts, of several formylating agents -
diformamide, triformamide, N,N,N,N-tetraformylhydrazine, and tris(diformylamino)methane -
were determined in the gas phase and in water or DCE by means of DFT calculations at the
B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level, the solvents being modeled with the IPCM method. The amide
oxygen atom in all cases appeared to be the most basic site, both in the Brøønsted and Lewis
sense, constituting a first step towards the understanding of the mechanism of this reaction.<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Despite the great importance of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes as intermediates in the chemical and
pharmaceutical industries, and the continuing intense research in this field, there is still a need for
new synthetic methods for the introduction of the aldehyde group into (hetero)aromatics. The
introduction of a formyl group by C-C bond formation is generally achieved by means of various
kinds of electrophilic aromatic substitutions, which can be subdivided further into two types of
reactions: (a) reactions involving the acid-promoted generation of a formyl cation or a precursor
thereof, such as formyl fluoride/boron trifluoride (Olah formylation),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1]</a> CO/HCl (Gattermann-
Koch reaction),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1,2]</a> CO/HF,<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1]</a> HCN/HCl (Gattermann reaction),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[3]</a> and the Vilsmeier
reagent,{1} formed from disubstituted formamides and phosphorus oxychloride or phosgene, and
(b) reactions yielding primary products which are immediately oxidized to aldehydes, such as the
synthesis of salicylaldehydes from phenols and paraformaldehyde in the presence of
SnCl4/trioctylamine<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1,4]</a> or the Duff reaction, yielding aromatic aldehydes from activated
aromatic compounds and urotropine in the presence of acids.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1,5]</a><p>

<p>Nowadays, the Vilsmeier (or Vilsmeier-Haack) reaction is the most common method for
formylation of aromatic rings. Nevertheless, it, like the other methods, has some significant
disadvantages. The formylating agents in these reactions are often toxic (as in the cases of carbon
monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, formyl fluoride, and phosgene), and they are also difficult to handle
in large amounts. Furthermore, the scope of these reactions is limited. The Vilsmeier-Haack
reaction is the method with the widest scope, but it is incapable of formylating simple alkylarenes
(unless they are much more reactive than benzene). A further difficulty is the occurrence of
phosphorus compounds in wastewater, which is a serious environmental problem, and the
formation of highly toxic, carcinogenic dialkylcarbamoyl chloride in a side reaction. The
dichloromethyl methyl ether/Lewis acid formylating system has an even wider scope than the
Vilsmeier-Haack reagent, but it has not yet found practical use.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[1,3,6]</a><p>

<h3>Formamide Derivatives as Formylating Agents</h3>

<p>Some time ago, we reported on a new synthetic method for the formylation of (hetero)aromatic
compounds using triformamide (1)/AlCl<sub>3</sub> as the formylating system (Scheme 1).<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[7,8]</a> This
reaction is useful for the formylation of a wide range of substrates, including unsubstituted and
alkyl-substituted aromatics, aromatic ethers, tertiary aromatic amines, fused aromatic rings, and
thiophenes. <p>

<p><h3>Scheme 1. New formylating agents based on formamide derivatives</h3><p>

<p>1. Triformamide <br>
2. Tris(diformylamino)methane<br>
3. Tris(dichloromethyl)amine<br>
4. N,N,N,N-tetraformylhydrazine<br></p>

<p>In this paper we wish to introduce some other reagents based on formamide derivatives that can
be used to formylate (hetero)aromatic compounds. We also present results of computational
investigations aimed at elucidation of the reaction intermediates of these formylations.<p>

<p>The typical mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions involves, as a preliminary
step, the formation of the actual electrophilic species. In the case of amides, it is assumed that the
Lewis basic site is the oxygen atom, by analogy with the behavior towards protonation.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[9]</a>
However, there is no guarantee that the behavior towards the proton exactly matches that
towards other Lewis acids. Thus, although one can easily formulate the generation of the
electrophilic species as a Lewis acid/base process involving the amide oxygen atom as the basic
site, the actual nature of the active species must be elucidated independently. For this purpose, we
have carried out quantum chemical calculations aimed at quantitative determination of the extent
of preference of formylating agents for protonation or Lewis acid complexation at either the
oxygen or nitrogen atom in the amide group.<p>

<h3>Formylations with Tris(diformylamino)methane</h3>

<p>During the preparation of triformamide (1),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[11,12]</a> tris(diformylamino)methane<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[10]</a> (2) is
formed as a by-product.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[8]</a> In an improved method, 2 can be prepared from triformamide and
sodium diformamide<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[13,14]</a> in 80% yield.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[8,15]</a></p>

<p>Tris(diformylamino)methane (2) contains six formyl groups, plus an additional one masked as an
orthoamide function, which seems to set a record for this type of compounds. In the presence of
(strong) Lewis acids, it is capable of formylating activated arenes.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[8,15]</a> The efficiency of 2 as a
formylating agent is higher than that of triformamide (1), since up to three out of the seven formyl
groups in 2 can be used synthetically, whereas 1 can transfer only one of its three formyl groups.<p>

<p>In the presence of AlCl<sub>3</sub> or BCl<sub>3</sub>, alkylarenes and aromatic ethers are formylated by
tris(diformylamino)methane (2) in moderate to good yields <A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#tbl1">(see Table 1)</a>. With AlCl<sub>3</sub> as the
Lewis acid, yields are highest if a tris(diformylamino)methane/AlCl<sub>3</sub> ratio of 1:6 to 1:8 is used
<a href="formylation.triformamide2.html#tbl2">(see Table 2)</a>. This corresponds to a ratio of 1:2 with regard to the number of formyl groups
transferred, a value coincident with the ratio found in the Friedel-Crafts acylation of esters and
anhydrides. 1,2-Dichloroethane proves to be the best solvent for the reaction, although other
solvents, such as chlorobenzene and carbon disulfide, are also suitable. Solvents containing nitro
groups, such as nitromethane and nitrobenzene, seem to suppress the formylating reaction,
probably because of complexation of the Lewis acid.<p>

<br><br><p>The reaction features a high para selectivity in the substrate, consistent with the high steric bulk of
the attacking species. As can be appreciated from Table 1 and Table 2, in order to achieve
satisfactory yields with formamide derivatives bearing one or more diformylamino groups, it is
necessary to use at least 2 equiv. of Lewis acid. It is hence very likely that the primary adduct
reacts with further Lewis acid to form the formylating species.</p>

<p>Lastly, we emphasize that the method we have presented can be performed using only
stoichiometric amounts of the formamide derivative, and 2 equiv. of Lewis acid per formyl group
transferred. E-factors (kg of waste per kg of product) of the new formylation procedures are in
the range from 4 to 11; further investigations will show whether these values can be reduced by
use of other types of catalysts. The comparable method with dichloromethyl methyl ether often
employs a large excess of the formylating mixture (up to 18 equiv.),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[16,17]</a> and the
regioselectivity is rather low.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[18]</a></p>

<h3>Formylation with Other Formamide Derivatives</h3>

<p>The perchlorinated derivative of triformamide, tris(dichloromethyl)amine (3),<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[12]</a> can be
prepared from N,N-dimethylformamide and phosgene, followed by photochlorination of the
resulting N,N-dimethylformamide chloride. In the presence of various Lewis and Brøønsted acids,
3 also proves to be a good formylating agent, and it is suitable for the formylation of a wide range
of aromatic compounds.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[8]</a> Thus, toluene reacts with 3/AlCl<sub>3</sub> to give tolualdehyde, in a yield of
70% and a p/o ratio of 30:1. Similarly, anisaldehyde can be prepared from anisole and 3/ZnCl<sub>2</sub> in
62% yield (p/o 24:1) <A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#Exp">(see Exp. Sect.)</a>. However, this complex subject will be dealt with in more
detail in a forthcoming paper. Preliminary studies on the formylating ability of another formamide
derivative, N,N,N,N-tetraformylhydrazine (4), are also encouraging.<A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[19,20]</a></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Arene formylation can conveniently be carried out in satisfactory yields with formamide
derivatives in the presence of Lewis acids. Quantum chemical calculations provide cogent
indications of the nature of the electrophilic species involved in this reaction. Thus, in the attack
by a proton or by AlCl<sub>3</sub> (protonation or Lewis acid adduct formation, respectively), the amide
oxygen atom is the most basic site, both in the gas phase and in water or DCE as solvents. The
formation of a chelate complex between the two adjacent carbonyl oxygen atoms in a
diformamide group and AlCl3 is also supported. All these results reinforce the proposition that
the attacking electrophilic species is formed by attachment of the Lewis acid to the oxygen atom
of the formamide derivatives, and endorse the proposed reaction mechanism (Scheme 5).<p>

<p><b>Formylation of Toluene with<i> 2</i> and Various Amounts of AlCl<sub>3</sub>.</p></b>
<p><b>(Typical) Procedure I:</b> Dry
AlCl<sub>3</sub> (90 mmol) was added with stirring to a mixture of toluene (45 mmol) and dry 1,2-
dichloroethane (25 mL), cooled in an ice/salt bath. After a few minutes,
tris(diformylamino)methane (2) (15 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred in the
cooling bath with exclusion of moisture for 20 h, during which the temperature rose to 0  °C. The
viscous, reddish brown mixture was carefully hydrolyzed by addition of 100 mL of ice-cold water,
and steam-distilled. The organic layer of the distillate was separated, and the aqueous phase
extracted three times with 10 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane. The combined organic layers were dried
with sodium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated at ordinary pressure. p-
Tolualdehyde (b.p. 84  °C/12 Torr) (204-205  °C/760 Torr <A href="formylation.triformamide2.html#refs">[26]</a>) was isolated by fractional
vacuum distillation. Yield 25 mmol (55%).</p>

<p><b>Formylation of Aromatic Compounds with <i>2</i>/Lewis Acid</p></b>
<p><b>(General) Procedure II:</b> A stirred
mixture of the aromatic compound (40-60 mmol) and 1,2-dichloroethane (25-40 mL) was cooled
in an ice/salt bath. The Lewis acid was added first, over 5 min, followed by
tris(diformylamino)methane (2). During the reaction time stated, the temperature of the reaction
mixture rose from ca. -15  °C to 0  °C <a href="formylation.triformamide2.html#tbl1">(see Table 1)</a>. After hydrolysis by careful addition of 100
mL of water, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times
with 10 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane. <b> Workup A:</b> The organic layers were combined, and the
solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue was treated with 100 mL of a saturated
sodium hydrogen sulfite solution, 3 mL of methanol, and ca. 250 mg of tetrabutylammonium
hydrogen sulfate. The bisulfite adduct separated upon stirring and was isolated by filtration. The
adduct was cleaved by addition of either 100 mL of 8% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution or 20 mL of 10% HCl.
The aldehyde was extracted from the mixture three times with 10 mL of ether. The combined
organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated. The
aldehyde was obtained by fractional distillation of the residue through a 15-cm Vigreux column.
<b>Workup B:</b> The combined organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate and filtered, and the
solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure. The aldehyde was obtained by fractional distillation
of the residue through a 10-cm Vigreux column.</p>

<b><p>Formylation of Aromatic Compounds with 3/Lewis Acid.</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Tolualdehyde from 3 and

was removed and the mixture was stirred for 15 h at 20  °C. The reaction mixture was
hydrolyzed with 50 mL of water and steam-distilled. The organic phase of the distillate was
separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The organic phases
were combined and dried with sodium sulfate. The drying agent was removed by filtration. The
solvents were removed from the filtrate by distillation at ordinary pressure. Tolualdehyde (2.31 g,
70%; 97% p-isomer, 3% o-isomer) was isolated by distillation (b.p. 80  °C/12 Torr). <b>(b)</b>
Anisaldehyde from 3 and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>: ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (2.18 g, 31.6 mmol) was added to a solution of 3 (4.2
g, 15.8 mmol) in anisole (20 mL, 187 mmol), whereupon the mixture turned red. The mixture was
heated with stirring for 3 h at 60-65  °C, hydrolyzed with 100 mL of water, and steam-distilled.
Dichloromethane (30 mL) was added to the distillate in order to produce better phase separation.
The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with 50 mL of
dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried with sodium sulfate. The solvents
