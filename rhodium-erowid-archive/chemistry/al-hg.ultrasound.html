<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The sonochemical promoted aluminum amalgam reduction of 2-nitroalkanols provides an improved yield and accelerated conversion to the corresponding amino alcohols when
compared to the non-ultrasound (benchtop) reductions. The appearance of byproduct hydroxylamines is minimized during the ultrasound promoted reaction. The product amino
alcohols were conveniently acylated in situ with promotion by ultrasound thus affording the N-acyl derivatives in the same operation.</p>
</div>

  <p>The importance of amino alcohols as synthetic intermediates together with
    their biological significance is widespread<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.
    In the case of 2-amino alcohols the corresponding 2-nitroalkanols may serve
    as the usual precursors to these compounds through selective reduction of
    the nitro group. While many methods for the reduction<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>
    of the nitro group exist, each has limitations; therefore useful alternatives
    based on the desired selectivity, efficiency or expense will always be embraced.
    We are interested in ultrasound-promoted organic transformations in which
    reactivity is enhanced by sonochemical activation<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> of insoluble reactants,
    catalysts, adsorbents or the generation of highly reactive microdispersions.</p>

  <p>Our experiences with the ultrasound (US)-enhanced aluminum amalgam (Al/Hg)
    reduction of phthalimides<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> led us to examine
    its effectiveness in the reduction of 2-nitroalkanols (<strong>Eq 1</strong>)<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>During a US-promoted Al/Hg reduction a highly reactive microdispersion is
    generated by shock wave-induced primary fragmentation together with the mass
    transport between the amalgam panicles and the solution of the substrate being
    increased by cavitation-induced turbulent flow<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>.
    As a result of applying the US-promoted Al/Hg method to 2-nitroalkanols. we
    report herein an inexpensive, rapid and mild method for the reduction of these
    substrates to the corresponding amino alcohols under the influence of ultrasound
    irradiation. 2-Nitroalkanols, conveniently obtained by the Henry reaction
    of aldehydes and nitroalkanes<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>, were subjected
    to sets of conditions involving ultrasound (US)-promoted and non-ultrasound
    (benchtop, BT) conditions. Overall the US-promoted reactions displayed improved
    yields over the benchtop cases together with a maximum 11-fold decrease
    in reaction time (<strong>Table 1</strong>)<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Since the concomitant reduction of water, the proton source for both BT and US cases,
    is also accelerated, the ultrasound cases required twice the equivalents of
    amalgam for complete consumption of starting material. In all cases the presence
    of the intermediate hydroxylamines were detected; however, conditions were
    such that complete reduction to the desired amino alcohols was the predominant
    reaction.</p>

  <p>We anticipated that the ultrasonic irradiation together with the increasing
    basicity of the reaction mixture would contribute toward enolization; however,
    the treatment of 2-nitrocyclohexanol with aluminum amalgam under US conditions
    in the presence of deuterium oxide provided no 2-amino-2-deuteriocyclohexanol.
    The mildly basic nature of the reaction mixture facilitates acylation of the
    amino group with acid chlorides or anhydrides after the reduction is complete
    so that the amino alcohols may be isolated as their N-benzoyl or N-acetyl
    derivatives as a result of a one-step process. Using enones or aryl halides
    as substrates and zinc or metal hydrides as reducing agents under heterogeneous
    conditions, Boudjouk<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> and Luche<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>
    have reported significant rate enhancements and improvements in yield as a
    result of ultrasound-promotion. Of note are the conjugate hydrogenations of
    Luche<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> which employ zinc metal under aqueous
    heterogenous conditions. As in the aluminum amalgam reduction such processes
    may involve the cavitation-induced generation of a microdispersion with simultaneous
    sonochemical activation. Application of high-intensity ultrasound to other
    types of reactions characterized by heterogeneity are currently under study
    in our laboratory and will be a topic of future reports.</p>


<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h5>General</h5>

    <p>Analytical and chromatographic methods used were as previously described<a href="al-hg.ultrasound.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>.
      Ultrasound was generated with a Sonies and Materials Vibra Cell<sup>TM</sup>
      Model VC 300 power supply and titanium microtip probe. The ultrasound-promoted
      reactions were run in a 200 mL cylindrical Pyrex jacketed vessel and cooled
      with a VCR Scientific 1140 constant temperature bath.</p>

<h5>Preparation of 2-nitroalkanols</h5>

<p>Nitroalkanols were prepared by nitro-aldol (Henry) reaction of the respective aldehyde (5 mmol) with the corresponding nitroalkane (25 mmol) in the presence of
tetramethylguanidine (0.25 mmol) in THF (5 mL). When TLC (hexanes/ethyl acetate, 4:1) indicated consumption of the aldehyde, the reaction mixture was concentrated in-
vacuo to yield a syrup which was gravity chromatographed to afford the nitroalkanol. Trans-2-nitrocyclohexanol was prepared by the reaction of silver nitrite (30 mmol)
with cyclohexene oxide (15 mmol) in DMSO/toluene (1:1 v/v 30 mL) at 100°C.</p>

<h5>Benchtop (BT) Reduction of Nitroalkanols</h5>

    <p>Food grade aluminum foil (2.5 mmol) was cut into strips (6x50 mm) and spirally
      wound about a glass stirring rod (6 mm dia.) to prepare coils. The coils
      were soaked in diethyl ether to remove machining oils and amalgamated individually
      by immersion (20 sec) in an agitated solution of aqueous mercury(II)chloride
      (2%) using forceps. After amalgamation the prepared coil was washed by immersion
      in agitated diethyl ether (5 sec) and immediately added to a THF (5 mL)
      solution of nitroalkanol (0.5 mmol) and water (7.5 mmol). The reaction is
      stirred under nitrogen until TLC (CHCl<sub>3</sub>/MeOH, 9:1) indicates
      consumption of starting material (high R<sub>f</sub>, yellow spot - ninhydrin)
      and intermediate hydroxylamine (lower R<sub>f</sub>, pink spot - ninhydrin)
      to yield amine (lowest R<sub>f</sub>, red spot - ninhydrin).</p>

<p>Once the reaction was complete (12-24 h), the grey suspension was filtered through a pad (1 cm) of Celite in a fritted glass funnel (30 mm, 60 mL, medium porosity) and
the filter cake was washed with THF (3x10 mL) and methanol (10 mL). The filtrate was concentrated to a colorless to pale yellow oil and flash chromatographed to afford
the amine.</p>

<h5>Ultrasound-Promoted (US) Reduction of Nitroalkanols</h5>

<p>Aluminum amalgam (5 mmol) prepared as described above was added to the cooled reaction vessel (25°C) containing THF (5 mL), nitroalkanol (0.5 mmol) and water (2.5 mmol).
The ultrasonic probe was immersed below the liquid surface (1 cm) and activated (power level = 3). Sonication was continued with addition of water (2.5 mmol) at 10 min
intervals until 15 mmol had been added. Total sonication time was 1.5 hr at which time TLC indicated near complete conversion to amine and the aluminum coils were
completely pulverized. The resultant thick grey slurry was then filtered as previously described or acylated.</p>

<h5>In-situ BT Acylation</h5>

    <p>When the reaction was judged complete by TLC, benzoyl chloride (0.55 mmol)
      was added via syringe and the reaction was stirred under nitrogen (1 h)
      at which TLC showed consumption of the amine and formation of the benzamide
      (high R<sub>f</sub>, tan spot - ninhydrin). Workup of the reaction was the
      same as previously described except that chromatography was done using hexanes/ethyl
      acetate.</p>

<h5>In-Situ US Acylation</h5>

<p>The thick slurry was diluted with additional THF (5 mL) and benzoyl chloride (0.55 mmol) was added via syringe. Ultrasound was reapplied (30 min), at which time TLC
indicated consumption of the amine. Workup was as previously described.</p>
