  <p>To a 3-necked 500 ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere was added 300 mL of 
    dry DCM, 0.1 mole of <a href="nitropropene.html">2-Nitropropene</a> (8.7g) and 0.5 moles of 1,3-Benzodioxole 
    (61 g). The flask was then secured within a dewar flask sitting on top of 
    a magnetic stirplate. Dry ice was added to the dewar flask which was filled 
    with acetone until a temperature of approx -78�C was acquired. Once the internal 
    flask temperature of -70�C was reached, 0.1 mole (19 g) of TiCl<sub>4</sub> 
    was dripped slowly into the stirred solution. The temp started to rise so 
    the addition was controlled to keep the internal flask temp around -60�C to 
    -70�C. The flask was then stirred for 30 mins at -70�C, by which time the 
    precipitate which formed from the addition had dissipated. The dewar flask 
    was removed and the stirring solution was allowed to warm up to room temperature, 
    during which time the black solution will change viscosity and colour.</p>
  <p>To hydrolyze the formed nitro-titanium complex, 100 mls of water was added 
    to the solution which was then refluxed for 2 hours. During the reflux a brown 
    gas (probably NO<sub>2</sub>) is evolved. The flask was cooled and vacuum 
    filtered (cleans it up a lot) the water layer seperated and discarded. The 
    organic layer was then washed with 3x200 mL of 10% NaOH and 1x200 mL of a 
    brine solution. It was then dried with magnesium sulfate, the DCM evaporated 
    and resulting orange-yellow oil vacuum distilled. The 1,3-Benzodioxole came 
    over at 40-45�C at 10 mbar then a yellow-green fluorescent oil (MDP2P) began 
    distilling at 135�C at 3 mbar.</p>

  <p>8 grams of MDP2P was collected, corresponding to 45% yield from 2-Nitropropene 
    or 23.5% from 1,3-Benzodioxole (calculated on the amount of 1,3-Benzodioxole 
    not recovered during workup).</p>
