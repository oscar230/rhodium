<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The preparation of lysergic acid <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamide is described. <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-Diethylamine was synthesised in 
three steps; sodium <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-acetate was treated with thionyl chloride giving <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-acetyl chloride which was 
reacted with ethylamine to give N-ethyl-<sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-acetamide. Reduction of this amide with lithium aluminium hydride 
gave <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamine which on treatment with a lysergic acid-imidazole complex gave the required product.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>As part of a study into the metabolism of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the synthesis of carbon-14 
labelled LSD has been investigated. Incorporation of carbon-14 the ergoline ring is not feasible and the two 
possibilities for labelling are the diethylamide side chain attached at C<sub>8</sub> and the methyl group attached at 
N6. Carbon-14-LSD labelled in the diethylamide side chain has already been prepared<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and in metabolic 
studies<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> only 4% of the carbon-14 was lost as <sup>14</sup>C-carbon dioxide. Thus LSD was prepared containing carbon-14 
in the diethylamide side chain.</p>

<p>The method used by Stoll et al.<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> for the synthesis of <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub> -diethylamine involved catalytic hydrogenation 
of <sup>14</sup>C-acetonitrile to give a mixture of diethylamine and ethylamine. The two amines were separated by 
counter-current distribution and the yield of <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamine was increased by reacting the ethylamine 
with ammonia and acetaldehyde.</p>

<p>In view of the difficulties in purification and the necessity of synthesising the <sup>14</sup>C-acetonitrile. The 
following scheme has been used in the present preparation:</p>

<p>No purification of the intermediates was necessary 
and the final solution of <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamine in ether was suitable for the subsequent formation of LSD. The 
incorporation of the <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamine into LSD was carried out by Stoll et al.<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> by reaction with isolysergic 
acid azide. A more convenient method is that of Cerny and Semonsky<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> which uses a lysergic acid-imidazole 
complex, formed in situ from lysergic acid and N,N'-carbonyl-diimidazole. This reaction is reported to give 
excellent yields when equimolar ratios of lysergic acid and amine are used.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Chemicals</h4>

<p>(+)-Lysergic acid  was purified prior to use by solution in warm 2N ammonia followed by precipitation with 2N acetic acid<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. </p>

<h4>Chromatography</h4>

<p>Thin layer chromatography was carried out on purchased aluminium roll, Silica gel F<sub>254</sub> (E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany). The Rf values for LSD, <em>iso</em>-LSD and lysergic acid in the solvent system, chloroform:methanol (3:2, v/v) are 0.74, 0.45 and 0.06 respectively. The spots were detected by fluorescence under UV light 254 nm) and by spraying with 1% N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in ethanol:HCl(aq) soln. (sp. gr. 1.18) (1:1, v/v).</p>

<p>Gas liquid chromatography was carried out on a Hewlett Packard Chromatograph and M. Scientific 402 High Efficiency Gas Chromatograph) fitted with a flame ionisation detector. A 5 ft glass column (3 mm I.D.) packed with PEG 6000 (10%), KOH (2%) on Chromosorb G (80-100 mesh) was used. Operating conditions: for N-ethylacetamide column temperature 150�C, N<sub>2</sub> flow rate 150 ml/min, retention time <span class="redtxt">[X]</span> min; for diethylamine, column temperature 75�C, N<sub>2</sub> flow rate 30 ml/min, retention time, 1.5 min.</p>

<h4>Radiochemical Techniques</h4>

<p>Radioactivity was determined with a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer (models 3214 and 3320) using a dioxane-based scintillator fluid@5. Scans of thin-layer chromatograms were made with a Packard radiochromatogram scanner model 7200). Also 0.5 cm wide sections of the absorbent were scraped into scintillation vials, scintillator fluid added and the radioactivity counted in the spectrometer.</p>

<h4>Synthesis a) <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-Diethylamine</h4>

<p>Thionyl chloride (160 mg) in dry ether (1 ml) was added to sodium <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-acetate (7.25 mg; 5 mCi) dried over 
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> under vacuum. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature and then similarly dried sodium 
acetate (63 mg) was added. After stirring for a further 20 min the solvent was removed and the solid washed 
with dry ether (3x1 ml). The pooled solution was stirred, ethylamine (300 mg) in dry ether (2 ml) added slowly 
drop by drop and after cooling to 0�C the precipitate was filtered off. The filtrate was then evaporated at 
0�C by a stream of dry nitrogen; the residue was taken up in dry ether (2 ml) and analysis showed a chemical 
yield of N-ethylacetamide of 55% (GLC) and a radiochemical yield of 48% (liquid scintillation counting, The 
solution of N-ethyl-<sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub> -acetamide in dry ether (1.5 ml) was added drop by drop to a stirred suspension of 
LiAlH<sub>4</sub> (160 mg) in dry ether (4 ml) at 20�C and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 
16 h. The suspension was then boiled under reflux for 3 h and after cooling to 0�C, water was added drop by 
drop to decompose the excess LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. A violent reaction occurred with loss of some radioactivity from the top 
of the condenser. When the reaction stopped. the mixture was transferred to a stoppered test tube, washed in 
with 10% NaOH, and saturated with NaCl. The mixture was then shaken vigorously and the ether layer removed 
after it had separated. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with ether (4x2 ml) and the pooled extracts dried 
over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Analysis gave a chemical yield of diethylamine of 31% (GLC) and a radiochemical yield of 32% 
(liquid scintillation counting) with respect to sodium acetate.</p>

<h4>Synthesis b - Lysergic acid <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamide</h4>

<p>(+)-Lysergic acid (98 mg) dried over P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> under vacuum was suspended in dry DMF (8 ml) and 
N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (252 mg) was added. After stirring the solution for 30 min in the dark at room 
temperature. [<sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>]-diethylamine (19 mg, 1.6 mCi) in dry ether (9 ml) was added drop by drop. The extent of 
reaction was determined (TLC) and a further quantity of diethylamine (7 mg) was added to increase the yield 
of LSD. After a further 2.5h stirring, the solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, and the 
residue dissolved in 2% (+)-tartaric acid (30 ml). This acidic solution (pH 4) was extracted with 
ether:ethanol (9:1, v/v) (4x25 ml). the pH adjusted to 9 with 10% NaOH and re-extracted with ether:ethanol 
(9:1, v/v) (6 x <span class="redtxt">[X]</span> ml). TLC showed that almost all the LSD and iso-LSD was present in the basic extract which 
was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, taken up in the minimum amount of methanol and streaked 
onto 4 20x20 cm Silica Gel H plates (0.75 mm). pre-eluted twice with methanol. After elution with 
chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) the two fluorescent bands were scraped off. eluted with methanol and assayed by 
TLC and radiochromatogram scanning. This showed traces of <em>iso</em>-LSD in the LSD and also some LSD in the iso-LSD.</p>

<p>The <sup>14</sup>C-LSD was purified by crystallisation from diisopropyl ether after exhaustive drying over P2O5 under 
vacuum. The yield was 29 mg (26%). specific activity 13.59 �Ci/mg). A second crop of <sup>14</sup>C-LSD of lower 
specific activity was obtained by the addition of LSD ( 25 mg) to the mother liquor of the above preparation, 
followed by recrystallisation (yield 25 mg, specific activity 2.78 �Ci/mg).</p>

<h4>Purity of 14C-LSD</h4>

<p>The mass spectrum (Varian MAT CH5) and IR spectrum (Perkin Elmer Infracord 37) are identical with a 
reference compound (Sandoz Ltd., Basle, Switzerland) and thin-layer chromatography in five systems [<strong>A</strong>, 
chloroform:methanol (3:2, v/v); <strong>B</strong>, acetone:chloroform (4:1, v/v); <strong>C</strong>, methanol:dioxane (3:2, v/v); <strong>D</strong>, 
chloroform: methanol:acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v); <strong>E</strong>, acetone:chloroform:NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) soln. (sp. gr. 0.88) 
(50:40:1.5, v/v)] gave only one spot. Radiochromatogram scanning and counting sections in 3 different 
solvent systems (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>) gave a radiochemical purity of ~97%.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>This method of lysergic acid <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamide synthesis has advantages over the method of Stoll et al.<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>The two counter-current distribution procedures and the column chromatographic purification of LSD have been 
eliminated with a considerable saving in time. The preparation is also carried out on a much smaller scale, 
enabling a higher specific activity in the final product.</p>

<p>The yield of N-ethylacetamide can be increased if acetic acid is used as starting material. In this case, 
acetyl chloride is obtained in a similar yield (~90%) but the reaction with ethylamine proceeds more smoothly 
to give a higher yield of N-ethylacetamide (85% as compared with 55-65%)<a href="14c-lsd.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. The yield on the reduction stage 
is poor (~60%) but this is probably due to losses during destruction of the excess lithium aluminium hydride, 
accentuated by the small scale of the preparation. Again the yield on the final stage, preparation of lysergic 
acid <sup>14</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-diethylamide, is low. This is due to formation of <em>iso</em>-LSD and losses in chromatography and 
crystallisation.</p>
