<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Aryl alkenes can be prepared from aryl ketones through reduction by refluxing with amalgamated zinc in a mixture of formic acid and ethanol.</p>
</div>

<p>Aldehydes and ketones play a central role in the synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds. Often the carbonyl 
group must be removed from a compound when its properties are no longer needed. One of the more commonly used methods for 
converting carbonyl groups into methyl or methylene groups is the Clemmensen reduction. We wish to report a modification 
of the Clemmensen reduction procedure which produces aryl alkenes directly from aryl ketones (<strong>Eq 1</strong>).</p>

<h4>Equation 1</h4>

<p>The original Clemmensen reduction procedure involved refluxing a mixture of the carbonyl compound, concentrated 
hydrochloric acid, and amalgamated zinc for 4-10 h.<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> While this procedure was successful with many compounds, variations 
were devised in order to widen the applicability of the reduction.<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>2-4</sup></a> In some instances the formation of alkenes was 
observed,<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>1a,4-9</sup></a> but no generally useful procedures for their preparation have been reported. Aliphatic ketones can be 
converted into alkenes in moderate yields using amalgamated zinc and chlorotrimethylsilane in ether, but 1-phenyl-1-ethanone 
gave no alkene under these conditions.<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Our modification of the Clemmensen procedure which gives the highest ratio of alkene to alkane and the highest isolated 
yields involves refluxing the ketone with amalgamated zinc in 88% formic acid and 95% ethanol for 1 h. Significant results 
are summarized in the <strong>Table</strong>. Acetic acid could be used in place of formic acid, but replacement with phosphoric acid, 
ammonium chloride, or anilinium chloride resulted in a lower ratio of alkene or a very slow reaction. Methanol as the 
cosolvent was about as effective as ethanol, but cyclohexane, benzene, <em>tert</em>-butyl alcohol, dioxane, or no cosolvent gave a 
slightly lower ratio of alkene. Zinc amalgamated in the usual manner was used for most experiments and gave the best 
results. When methylene chloride was used for extraction during the work-up instead of diethyl ether, the isolated yields 
were improved significantly.<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>1-Phenyl-2-propanone and 2-octanone, both alkyl ketones, did not react appreciably under the mild conditions used for 
aromatic ketones. 1-Phenyl-1-ethanone was reduced to a 16:84 GC ratio of ethylbenzene to styrene, but a distilled yield of 
only 19% was obtained. A <sup>1</sup>H NMR of an undistilled sample showed the presence of a cyclopropyl group which is believed to be 
formed from a zinc-carbene intermediate (Zn=C) reacting with alkene.<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Rearrangement of the same zinc-carbene intermediate accounts for the formation of alkene. Under the milder Clemmensen 
reduction conditions used here, apparently aryl ketones easily form the zinc-carbene intermediate, and rearrangement to 
the alkene is normally the major reaction pathway.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3><p><strong>Reduction of 1-Phenyl-1-butanone</strong></p> 

<p>This procedure was used for all reactions reported in the <strong>Table</strong>. In a round bottom flask were placed 10.11 g (0.155 mol) 
of Zn dust, 0.498 g (1.84 mmol) of HgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 mL of conc. HCl, and a stir bar. After 10 min of stirring, the 
liquid was decanted, and any lumps were broken up with a spatula. To the flask were added 20 mL of 88% formic acid, 6 mL of 
95% ethanol, and 2.0 mL (13.78 mmol) of 1-phenyl-1-butanone. The mixture was refluxed and stirred for 1 h. The liquid was 
decanted into a separatory funnel, and the residue stirred with 20 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min. The water was also added to the 
separatory funnel and the residue stirred with 20 mL of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min. The CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was used to extract the aqueous phase. 
The residue was washed two more times with 20 mL each of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and the CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was used to extract the aqueous phase each 
time. The combined CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> solution was washed with 1 N NaOH until the wash was basic (60 mL and 30 mL) and with sat. NaCl 
solution (60 mL) and dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>. After filtration and solvent removal, the residue was distilled using a Kugelrohr 
apparatus to give 1.46 g of product (80% yield based on the molecular weight of the alkene) (bath temp 113-121ï¿½C at 43 torr).</p> 

<p>The IR and NMR spectra were a good match for that of <em>trans</em>-1-phenyl-1-butene, and the NMR spectrum also showed peaks 
indicative of the presence of small amounts of <em>cis</em>-1-phenyl-1-butene, butylbenzene, and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Analysis by GC (10% 
Carbowax 20M) showed significant peaks at 0.54 min (1.3%), 1.7 min (7.2%), 2.3 min (10.1%) 3.4 min (80.5%). The peaks at 
0.54, 1.7, and 3.4 min correspond to the retention times of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, butylbenzene, and <em>trans</em>-1-phenyl-1-butene, respectively. 
The peaks at 2.3 and 3.4 min were collected by preparative GC. The NMR of the peak at 2.3 min agreed with that reported for 
<em>cis</em>-1-phenyl-1-butene,<a href="arylketones2arylalkenes.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> and the NMR of the peak at 3.4 min matched that of <em>trans</em>-1-phenyl-1-butene.</p>
