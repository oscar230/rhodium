	<h1>Red Phosphorous/Iodine Methamphetamine Synthesis</h1>
	by Placebo
</center>
<hr>

<p>Ok, this is an amalgamation of many peoples methods! I beleive this to be the
best, simplest, fastest, and cleanest method for producing meth-amphetamine, in
the highest yeilds possible for RP/I2/E reaction! Remember, each and every step
gives small losses, and this method has the least steps! It is a culmination of
efforts by, Worlock, CHEMMAN, and maybe a few tiny touches by me! I re-iterate,
I don't want any congratulations except for the write-up itself!</p>

<p>You will need these things, and no substitutions allowed! If you can't get this
shit, you aint ready to make the best Go-Go in town! This is a refinement of all
methods, and the next step up from Push Pull, But nobody should be dicouraged
from attempting this, as you will probably find it easier! PH paper, isn't even
necessary!</p>

<p>This post is one method from Go to Whoah! This post has to be followed from GO
to Whoah! Otherwise you can run into trouble, as povidone is not removed in this
extraction! It will be removed at the end! Each step was chosen to compliment
the next! Understand?</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Various jars
<li>2L pyrex vessel
<li>2L 2 neck round flat bottom flask
<li>1 condenser, I reccomend a coil condenser but a liebig will suffice!
<li>1 sloping splashhead or better still, a steam distillation sloping splashhead!
<li>A steam pressure cooker, that has releif valve at top
<li>Hotplate, electric of course!
<li>Filter paper, Bucner and vacuum would be nice too!
<li>thermometer
<li>1 glass stopper
<li>lengths of clear pvc tubing
<li>Pot with vegetable oil, that can fit your reaction vessel
</ul>

<h3>Reagents (All must be clean and anhydrous!)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Iodine crystals
<li>Red Phosphorous
<li>Pseudo-ephedrine, or ephedrine
<li>Methanol
<li>Toluene
<li>Acetone
<li>NaOH
<li>Ice
</ul>

<h3>Extraction of pfed</h3>

<p>Ok, this method will deal with the Hcl salt of pfed, and a streamlined version
of "the cure"! All pills are dumped into a large jar and double the volume of
methanol poured on top! This is stirred vigourously and let to settle, in the
fridge seems to speed it up! After top methanol layer has cleared it is
carefully decanted off. This procedure is repeated 3 times. All methanol pulls
are put together and reduced on a hotplate. As methanol gets down to last little
bit, it is taken off heat Then a portion of acetone, twice your remaing liquid
is dropped in. This forces the pfed crystals to crash out. Then remaining liquid
is carefully evaped off.</p>

<p>Now you have your crude/dirty pfed Hcl. Next we will be doing successive toluene
washes So put your pfed crystals in a pyrex (heat proof glass) Now add toluene
to a safe level that can be lightly boiled on hotplate After about 5 mins
boiling with stirring. Take off heat and let settle a minute. Now carefully pour
off toluene into a filter to catch any remnants of pfed that may follow. Now if
you get the toluene that has our contaminents in it and add some water You will
see the crap crash from the toluene into the water This is the crap that came
thru with the methanol pull!</p>

<p>So as we continue to do multiple toluene washes, We will continue to test the
toluene after pouring it off, To see how we are progressing with the cleanup!
When we have reached a point where no crap comes out of the toluene, With the
addition of water, then we are ready to try acetone! Usually about 3 boils in
toluene, but of course it depends how much your using! So, as before we will add
a portion of acetone and boil lightly! Now when we pour off the acetone, we will
add a tiny amount of water and some NaOH This is our final test, when you do
this and no crap falls out of acetone you are ready!</p>

<p>This will be the cleanest pfed you have ever seen, guarenteed! AND, yeilds
should be >90% if your careful! 95% is good.</p>

<h3>Reaction</h3>

<p>Smallest reaction to be attempted, especially by newbees, is 1oz of pfed! So
that even taking into account sloppiness, lack of experience and losses along
the way You should get some product!</p>

<p>Ratios of reagents are, 3:3:1 or 1:1:1/3 ie.E:I:RP aka, equal amounts of Iodine
and pfed, and a third as much RP! Comprenda!</p>

<p>Ok first prepare yourself an icebath! Yes icecubes and water in a sink or
bucket! Now, many will say you should add this first or that first! Well after
much reading of different peoples methods, I say.... Chuck the whole shebang in
together, while your flask is on ice, Lift and swirl ingredients together, while
maintaing on ice! Put your condenser on top and start water running thru, from
bottom to top! Now, the idea is to get the reaction going in the most controlled
way possible. Now you want to let reagents react in the icebath, if at all, Then
move vessel from icebath to room temp, If things look like they're going too
fast, put back in ice bath, You want to keep the reaction going but only at a
nice slow, controlled pace! This is also necessary to control vapour in the
condenser! Thick and or dis-colored smoke is bad! and plumes of smoke will
escape from condenser As things progress at a nice slow pace, as things slow too
much you can start applying heat! So prepare an oilbath and bring to about 50c,
now if there is no more action in your vessel You can move it to the oilbath,
and same as before, when things slow down, Adjust heat up, to say 100c then 150c
for one hour, to make sure reaction has completed The whole time you should be
watching to keep a nice reflux going, and not too much vapour is escaping from
condenser!</p>

<p>Now remove from heat and disconnect condenser, Now add ice water to quench
reaction, reason for ice water is to calm the reaction down when NaOH is added
Now its up to you if you want to filter out RP or leave till the end I would
leave it, it will be washed nicely by next process and be easier to filter! Now
add lots of NaOH to bring reaction mix to positive 14PH You cannot over-basify
as meth won't be destroyed, its a tough MF!</p>

<h3>Steam Distillation</h3>

<p>Now you need to set up your glassware for steam distillation! So attach steam
distillation sloping splashhead to top hole of flask! Now attach plastic hose to
steam inlet and other end, on release valve of pressure cooker that is full of
water! Now attach condenser on end of splashhead, and rig up some kind of prop
for it to stay up! Now place a jar at the end of condenser to catch our
distillate! Now you want to heat both the pressure cooker, and the reaction
flask! Now sit back and get ready for one of the most beautiful sites and
smells! The meth freebase that is sitting on the top of your aqueous layer in
flask will vapourise and be carried across and be condensed in the condenser and
trickle down into your jar It will sit atop a bottom layer of water! After the
last of the oil has come across, change jars and leave the setup to run for
another hour Just to make sure you got it all! Any povidone from the pills will
be stuck behind in the reaction vessel It has been noted that some polymer that
may have been left from extraction, may follow the steam!</p>

<h3>Crystallisation</h3>

<p>So, now we have a jar of water, with this sweet clear oil sitting on top! Now
options are to add Hcl acid slowly with stirring until oil layer disappears and
then evap the whole lot to get crystals! Or, as I found, you may have some
polymer that has come over with the steam and is now sitting in the water layer,
and it looks cloudy! So I don't want to evap all that, it will just concentrate
the shit in there (plus its very time consuming evapping water, plus you risk
losing some meth as the water evaps) So, I think you should just throw a little
toluene into jar, and then seperate! Now your absolutly pure meth freebase is in
your toluene! Now you can either gas, for instant clean meth, or Add minimal
DH2O and then acidify to PH7, shake, seperate and evap water for crystals!
repeat this step if you do it this way, as some more may come in second go!</p>

<p>Now with this process from start to finish, you shouldn't need to re-crystallise
As your product should be the cleanest shit anybody has ever seen anyway! But
you may want to for the purpose of growing nice big crystals! In which case, add
just enough hot methanol to dissolve all your meth and then place in freezer.
The secret is, the slower the evap, the bigger the crystals! So a nice slow room
temp evap over several days might be fun!</p>

<p>Enjoy, and do not attempt anything above, before you completely understand what you are doing! You must have a sound understanding of the basics first!</p>
