  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Olefins 
    higher than 3-C were converted to ketones using aqueous chloropalladate ion 
    as oxidant. The chloride ion content of the solution was kept at very low 
    levels relative to normal usage to increase significantly the reaction rates 
    of these higher olefins. The reduced palladium was reoxidized electrochemically 
    using the ferric/ferrous couple as the transfer agent. Using cyclopentene 
    as a model compound the ionic strength, the acidity, the concentration of 
    palladium, the means of extracting product and the means of adding olefin 
    were all adjusted as to achieve about 70% current selectivity with minimal 
    palladium inventory. There were indications of even better behaviour with 
    several open chain ketones.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">This
  paper discusses a means of converting olefins higher in molecular weight than
  ethylene into the corresponding ketones via an electrochemical version of the
  Wacker process. In the latter process [ 1-3 ], the olefin, ethylene or
  sometimes propylene, is bubbled through an aqueous solution of palladium
  chloride where it is converted to the corresponding carbonyl compound,
  acetaldehyde or acetone in these cases. With no oxidant present, palladium
  metal would eventually precipitate out.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">However, 
    cupric chloride and hydrochloric acid are also present in the solution to 
    reoxidize the reduced palladium and form the dichlorocuprate (1) anion. An 
    excess of hydrochloric acid is required to render the cuprous complex thermodynamically 
    stable. In the absence of excess chloride, cuprous ion would dismutate to 
    copper metal and cupric ion. Finally, the cupric ion is regenerated by blowing 
    air or oxygen through the mixture so that the net result is that olefin plus 
    oxygen yield carbonyl, and all other reagents are recycled.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Kinetic
  and mechanistic work on the process [4-7] reveals that the chemical Wacker
  process runs despite the fact that the chloride required to stabilize the
  cuprous ion is a strong inhibitor for the reaction. There are at least two
  steps in the mechanism where it has been postulated<o:p>
  </o:p>that
  chloride ion inhibits. One is in the formation of a palladium olefin complex
  ion:<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually,
  this soluble ion is postulated by analogy with the platinum analogue, Zeise's

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Kinetic
  and isotopic data suggest that after the complex forms, the next step involves
  reaction with water to produce an aqua complex which ionizes to a hydroxy
  complex releasing more chloride and hydrogen ions:<o:p>
  </o:p>

    &nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"> 
    In the absence of excess chloride, the same complex may be arrived at by the 
    reaction of an aqua complex of PdCl2OH(H20)- with an olefin molecule.<o:p> 
    &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">At
  this point, a relatively slow rearrangement of the complex occurs whose
  details are in doubt. A good discussion of the mechanism is given by Aguilo
  [9]. There may be a shift of the OH group from a trans- to a cis-position
  relative to the olefin. Then, the complexed olefin is apparently attacked at
  one end of the double bond by the neighbouring OH group causing the organic
  ligand to shift from <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">p</span>-bonding
  to <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">s</span>-bonding to the
  palladium. A hydride is shifted from the attacked carbon to its neighbour, and
  a molecule of the carbonyl compound splits off the complex. The palladium is
  left in a reduced form, possibly as a hydride (postulated by Halpern [10])
  which soon decomposes to the metal:<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -1.8pt; tab-stops: center 468.0pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
  most certain step in the above scheme is the shift of the hydrogen.
  Radiotracer studies have confirmed that the hydrogens on the carbon a to the
  carbonyl come from the olefin and not from the solvent. The hydride shift is
  not involved in the rate determining step, however, based on the lack of a
  kinetic isotope effect with C2D4. The reaction shows 'carbonium ion character'
  in that the Markonikov product is obtained. That is, ketones are formed from
  a-olefins in great preference to aldehydes. It is possible that the Pd-C sbond
  is partially ionic, leaving a slightly positively charged carbon. The effect
  of hydrocarbon structure on reaction rate is small, so that a free carbonium
  ion is probably not involved in the rate determining step. In any case, the
  important mechanistic point for the purposes of this work is that the reaction
  is sharply inhibited by chloride ion. The original workers [4] give an
  empirical rate expression for the ethylene reaction as:</font></p>

  the Wacker process runs at ratios of chloride to palladium of 200 to 400, in

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Apparently,
  ethylene is so reactive that it can withstand this impediment; however,
  reactivity drops with olefin size as given by the data of Henry at 25º C

  second inherent drawback associated with the use of air oxidation in acidic
  copper halide solutions is the formation of chlorinated by-products. Except
  for its palladium content the solution used for air regeneration in the Wacker
  process has the same ingredients as those used in the Kellogg olefin-oxyhydrochlorination
  process [12]. The by-products are apparently troublesome to remove, as
  indicated by the issue of various patents concerned with their separation
  [13].<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
  this paper, we consider an electrochemical process that permits the reaction
  to be run in the absence of excess chloride and oxygen. The reduced palladium,
  in whatever form it exists before it precipitates (shown above as PdCl3H2-),
  is reacted with an oxidant not requiring chloride for stability, such as
  ferric ion. The resulting ferrous ion is reoxidized electrochemically at an
  anode inserted in the aqueous phase. At the cathode conditions are arranged so
  that hydrogen is liberated. The complete scheme is:<o:p>

  other reagents recycle. This idea was actually suggested in 1967 by
  researchers at Hoechst [14]. The patent was apparently never implemented
  commercially, perhaps because it advocated total elimination of chloride ion,
  and might, therefore, have been inoperable.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The

    was feasible: whether the product could be isolated in high yield, whether 
    the palladium inventory could be kept economically low and whether the palladium 
    could be successfully recycled, and so on. The olefin chosen for the model

  investigation was carried out in a simple glass apparatus, which was gradually
  modified and enlarged with other glass ancillaries as the variables were
  analysed and the process took shape. The basic cells consisted of a jacketed
  anode compartment connected via a glass frit to a side arm containing the
  cathode. The cathode was a platinum wire used for hydrogen evolution. The
  anode compartments were of 250 or 500 cm³ capacity. A 5 cm x 5 cm gold-plated
  tantalum screen served as the anode for most of the experiments, although a 5
  cm² platinum screen was used in preliminary runs. The cell was also equipped
  with a gold wire probe and a reference electrode containing a gold wire,
  immersed in an equimolar mixture of ferrous and ferric perchlorates in 0.3 M
  perchloric acid. This was used to monitor the potential of the ferrous-ferric

  peroxide to form the ferric salt. It was subsequently found that during this
  iron dissolution step some reduction of perchlorate to chloride occurred to
  the extent of 0.05-0.15 moles of Cl per mole of Fe2+. Since the concentration
  of iron ions in solution eventually preferred was 0.2 M, an added chloride ion

  palladium concentration while maintaining reasonable electrolyte conductivity,
  a concentration of 0.3 M HCl04 was chosen. However, because of the high
  reaction rates ultimately obtained, lower palladium concentrations could have
  been tolerated and higher acidity would have been desirable. This would have
  improved conductivity, reduced concentration polarization in the cathode

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Early 
    attempts to use the ferric/ferrous redox couple at initial ferric concentrations 
    of 0.6 M led to precipitate formation in the solution after the cyclopentene 
    was introduced. This precipitation slowly generated palladium black, if wet 
    with dilute perchloric acid or dissolved in aqueous acetone. Based on literature 
    reports of the isolation of such complexes, it was probably the (PdC12 olefin)² 
    dimer referred to in the Introduction. It is interesting that this complex 
    could be dissolved in 1.3 N hydrochloric acid, where it yielded no palladium 
    precipitate in 24 h, again attesting to the inhibitory properties of chloride 
    ion. The material was not isolated in a pure enough form to be analysed, however.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Reducing
  the ferric ion concentrati6n prevented the precipitation of the complex.
  Apparently, the palladium-cyclopentene complex, with its high hydrocarbon
  content, and therefore borderline solubility in water, was salted out by the
  high ionic strength provided by the ferric ion. (A solution of 0.6 M in ferric
  perchlorate contributes 1/2 (0.6 x 9) + 3 x 0.6 = 3.6 mol 1-¹ to the ionic
  strength.) Reducing the iron concentration and thereby the ionic strength,
  avoided precipitate formation and also increased the rate of the reaction
  somewhat (Table 4).<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Under 
    conditions of reduced ferric and chloride contents, the factor having the 
    largest effect on the reaction rate was the mode of feeding the olefin. Admitting 
    it as gas bubbles gave a higher rate than simply stirring the liquid cyclopentene. 
    Adding a mechanical mixer along with the gas feed increased the rate further, 
    and finally sparging the olefin as a fine foam gave the highest rates obtained; 
    in the order of 100 A g -¹ (Table 6) as contrasted to the values of 600 mA 
    g-¹ in Table 5. The practical significance of this is that the palladium inventory 
    required for commercial production becomes minimal at the highest rates. For 
    example, at 100 A g -¹ an inventory of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>5700 g Pd is adequate for a production rate of ten million pounds of 
    cyclopentanone per year at 70% selectivity. The investment cost of palladium 
    should, therefore, amount to well under one cent per pound of ketone produced. 
    The range of values shown in Table 6 is partially due to other variables studied, 
    namely temperature and concentration, and partly due to the experimental variability 
    connected with a diffusion limited reaction. These data indicate that the 
    reaction itself is very fast and that the rate is limited only by the diffusion 
    of the olefin into the liquid phase or by diffusion of the olefin complex 
    from the edge of the bubbles into the bulk. The temperature dependence under 
    these conditions was very low, and the reproducibility was not good (± 10%) 
    again as might be expected for a diffusion limitation (Table 7).<o:p> </o:p>

  rates of oxidation of the ketone were measured in separate experiments simply
  by adding it to the electrolyte containing the palladium chloride, perchloric
  acid and ferric perchlorate, and measuring the rate of ferric reduction from
  the open circuit voltage decline. The rates were not constant in a single run,
  but appeared to increase with time, as if the initially formed products were
  more reactive than the starting ketone. At a given conversion level, the rates
  were fairly sensitive to temperature, as shown in Table 10.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not
  all the oxidation was caused by the palladium. At 70º C, the oxidation rate
  due to ferric alone in the absence of palladium was one fourth that of the
  oxidation rate of the total system. In the absence of ferric ion palladous ion
  oxidized cyclopentanone readily, as evidenced by a rapid drop in potential and
  precipitation of palladium metal. No rate data were taken under the latter
  conditions, however.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
  ketone oxidation reaction probably does not go to a single intermediate, but
  appears to proceed largely to C02. In a long term run with an excess of
  oxidants, the reaction rate declined with time until eventually 20 equivs of
  oxidant were consumed per mole of ketone. Complete conversion to C02 would
  require 26 equivs per mole. In a subsequent run, considerable C02 was trapped
  in an Ascarite tube, though the results were not quantitative. This result is
  favourable, for it means that the current used in oxidizing ketone corresponds
  to very little wasted ketone. A current selectivity of 70% corresponds to a
  product selecitivity of 98%, assuming the side oxidation proceeds all the way
  to C02.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Due
  to the complexity of the ketone side reactions, the above data may be used
  only as a rough index of the rate of product loss via side reactions. Using
  the maximum rate of ketone oxidation at 55º C, and the observed rate of
  olefin oxidation, one calculates current selectivities to product which are
  higher than those actually observed. Thus, the yields must also be lowered by
  acid catalysed condensation reactions and &quot; physical losses, not detected
  by this method. In any case, the need for continuous extraction to reduce the
  concentration of ketone in the electrolyte at any time, is clearly indicated.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The

  extracted the ketone from the aqueous phase quite efficiently and was at the
  same time the fed olefin. However, as has been discussed, rates of reaction
  were very low unless the olefin was fed as a gas, which made it impossible to

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Furthermore,

  cyclopentene, so that in long runs black palladium was visible in the solvent

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was possible to operate at 55º C with liquid cyclopentene (b.p. = 44º C)
  with a mixed extractant containing cyclopentene plus a higher boiling liquid
  such as benzene or cyclohexane. However, the organic layer tended to be rich
  in cyclopentene and the palladium complex was again extracted.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, it was realized that the extractant would have to be a saturated
  hydrocarbon and that the cyclopentene gas would have to be fed in a separate
  vessel so that it would not accumulate in the extractant stream. Since the
  reaction is diffusion limited, the amount of olefin dissolved in the
  electrolyte and thereby able to reach the extractant would be negligible.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cyclohexane and 2-methylpentane were tried. Their ability to extract
  cyclopentanone from aqueous acid into a hydrocarbon layer was inferior to that
  of cyclopentene, but still tolerable (Table 11).<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The methylpentane was finally selected as best since its lower boiling point,
  60º C (cf. 81º C for cyclohexane), reduced the rate of evaporation of the
  product (b.p. = 131º C) from the extractant boiler. Its use completely
  eliminated the palladium extraction problem. The rate of accumulation of
  ketone in the boiler was measured by gas chromatography relative to internal
  standards which had been placed in the boiler at the start of the experiments.
  In trial extraction experiments, the contacting efficiency was calculated to
  be about one quarter to one third of that if saturation were always complete.
  This, coupled with the limited solvent recycle rates and the low distribution
  constant, caused the extraction half-life to be estimated at about 2 h. Thus,
  in continuous runs the product concentration in the electrolyte built up
  slowly until the rate of extraction matched the rate of production of
  cyclopentanone. Product accumulation in the solvent boiler lagged considerably
  behind its production and continued after the reaction stopped. All of this
  could be improved in a larger plant of pilot unit, and the yields thereby
  increased.<o:p>

    longest run in the apparatus of Fig. I lasted for over six hours on feed, 
    during which time the reaction continued at a higher and fairly constant rate 
    and the palladium was calculated to have been regenerated over 90 times, as 
    shown in Table 12. The rate of product accumulation in the extractant boiler 
    lagged considerably behind the calculated rate of product generation (assuming 
    100% current selectivity) as shown in Fig. 4. The final yield, including material 
    later extracted from the electrolyte with ether, was 67% of that calculated 
    from the current passed and ferric ion reduced. The slope of the product accumulation 
    curve of Fig. 4 never approached this value, indicating that the extraction 
    was so poor that a steady-state was never reached during the six hours of 
    ketone production. In addition, later work with normal pentanones and hexanones 
    indicated that despite their high boiling points (13º C for cyclopentanone) 
    these intermediate ketones have an appreciable vapour pressure at 55º C and 
    might accumulate in the feed reboiler. No analysis of the boiler contents 
    was made, however. In view of all the above, the current selectivity of 67% 
    represents a minimal value which should easily be surpassed with other ketones 
    or in more industrially configured apparatuses.<o:p> </o:p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

  system in balance at steady-state. Since the area of the membrane would be
  equal to that of the anode, more reasonable current densities, in the range of
  100-200 mA cm-² , would be required across the membrane. With partial
  occupancy of the membrane sites by polyvalent Fe2+ and Fe 3+ ions, a voltage
  drop of the order of 1.0 V might be expected. However, a proton transference
  number of about 1.0 would maintain high conductivity in the liquid on both
  sides of the membrane giving resistance losses of say 0.2 V. This coupled with
  anode and cathode voltage losses of 0.3 and 0.2 V respectively, plus a
  theoretical cell voltage of 0.8 V, gives a total cell voltage of about 2.5 V.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
  possibility of manufacturing other ketones by this electrochemical process was
  examined briefly. It was first of all verified that open chain ketones are at
  least an order of magnitude more stable to oxidation than cyclopentanone in
  the acidic palladous-ferric solution (Table 13). The results suggest that
  yields should be higher and the necessity for continuous extraction is less
  for ketones other than cyclopentanone from the standpoint of oxidation
  stability alone. Of course, the possibility of acid catalysed condensations,
  not measured by the above procedure, still makes continuous extraction
  mandatory.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The yields and reaction rates with open
  chain olefins were of the same order of magnitude as cyclopentene (Table 14).
  This was determined in batch experiments run without continuous liquid
  extraction; using only the two right-hand vessels in Fig. 1. Most of the
  product ketone was found in the olefin boiler due to the exceptionally high
  activity coefficients of C5 and C6 ketones in aqueous solutions. Thus, the
  product was being removed continuously. The isomer distributions shown in the
  last column verify that terminal olefins form essentially no aldehydes, that
  double bonds do not migrate in this process and that internal olefins form the
  two possible ketones in approximately the manner expected from the carbonium
  ion character of the reaction. In the case of pentene-2 a more sensitive
  chromatograph was used, and a number of minor peaks were found.
  Their total area amounted to less than 1% of the major product peaks, however.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -1.8pt" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
  reaction was also carried out on the branched olefin, 2-methyl butene-2, a
  likely contaminant of cyclopentene. Gas-liquid chromatography on the resultant
  extract showed at least six different products in comparable amounts, whose
  identity was not further investigated. Smidt [3] also indicated that olefins
  bearing no hydrogen on one of the double-bonded carbons react slowly,
  undergoing hydration, other oxidations and rearrangements, and later,
  cleavage. lsobutylene, for example, yielded tertiary butanol along with
  acetone, isobutyraldehyde, a-methyl acrolein and methyl ethyl ketone. Branched
  olefins are best eliminated from the feed stream.</font></p>

    </font></span></b><font face="Arial" size="3">This electrochemical chloropalladate 
    process looks promising for small plants converting C4 and higher linear olefins 
    to the corresponding ketones, cases where the corresponding air oxidation 
    process has not been commercialised. The advantage of the electrochemical 
    process lies in its avoidance of excess chloride, which leads to slow rates 
    and chlorinated by-products. The process has been demonstrated in a continuous 
    laboratory unit with good current selectivities and maintenance of high catalyst 
    activity. The process cost remains to be investigated. It is known that the 
    palladium inventory can be very low, but the electrode cost and the materials 
    of construction have not been determined. The details of product recovery 
    via extraction or stripping would have to be worked out for each olefin one 
    desires to oxidize. Further studies would also have to be carried out to choose<o:p>
