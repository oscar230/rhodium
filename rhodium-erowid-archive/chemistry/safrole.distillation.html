Vigreux column, 3-way adapter, Liebig condenser, with thermometer 
(and thermometer adapter, if necessary), stands, clamps and bossheads.</p>
<p><b>**</b> Two options exist for a heating/stirring equipment. Either you can

<p><b>****</b> Two options exist for a water source. Either you can run fresh
tap water through vinyl tubing to your condenser and back to the drain,
or you can use a small recirculating water pump such as those found
in water fountains.</p>


<h3>Procedure:</h3>

<p>Time to set up for a fractional vacuum distillation (<b>see notes 
unless you've already performed this technique!</b>).<p>

There are two primary methods of heating the oil in the flask. One simple 
method for heating the oil has the clamped flask sitting on an electric 
heating mantle that is controlled by a variac. The heating mantle rests 
on a stirrer (or a hot plate stirrer although the heat is never turned 
on). An alternative method is to have the clamped flask sitting in 
an aluminum saucepan. This saucepan rests on the hot plate stirrer. Fill 
the saucepan with enough oil to mostly submerge your 500mL distilling
flask, and use a cooking oil thermometer to monitor the temperature of
the oil bath.</p>

<p>You should have no more than 300ml of our fragrant essential oil in the 
500mL round bottom flask and the flask should also contain a 1" egg (or 
octagonal) stirbar. Add your column to the flask, then place the 3-way 
adapter ontop, then the condenser, then the vacuum adapter, and put a 
250mL RB flask as the receiving flask. You should have placed a clamp at the
fractionating column and at the receiving flask. If desired, you can 
optionally place another clamp on the condenser. Last fit your thermometer
to your thermometer adapter (if you're using one) and place your thermometer 
into the 3-way adapter. Get your vacuum ready, but not connected or turned 
on.</p>

<p>During this run, you're going to have to insulate your fractionating 
column. Glass wool is the best heat resistant insulator. If you find
it at your hardware store make use of it. Fleece also works incredibly
well, but will not tolerate temperatures above 150�C. If you expect
your oil to come across above that temperature and can't find glass wool, 
cotton cloth (such pieces of a towel or sock), wrapped around the column 
will suffice. Use wire to keep the insulating material on. If you are 
distilling your safrole at a higher temperature you will need insulation, 
otherwise too much safrole will fall back into the distillation pot as 
reflux. If you have a good vacuum (<10mmHg) or your column is silvered and vacuum jacketed you likely can get away with no insulation.<p>

Now set your stirrer to spin like mad and heat the oil bath up quickly to 
the temperature you expect your safrole to come over. Use the oil thermometer 
to monitor the temperature of your oil bath, so you don't vastly overshoot 
the mark where safrole is going to come over. In my most recent case it 
was 145�C for a 60mmHg vacuum. Sometimes I'll just set it on low, and 
go off to grab something to eat as the oil warms up. Now, when the cooking 
oil is at 145�C... lower the heat, and apply the vacuum. Nothing usually 
comes over. Now, continue heating, but this time slowly, to about 25-30�C 
above that temperature... nothing usually comes over. If you have got 
something to come over, and it isn't your main fraction, remove the heat, 
disconnect your vacuum, and empty the garbage fraction that's in your 
flask, then replace it and continue... All of a sudden you're going to 
see the temperature on your thermometer climb quickly and hit that
temperature, say 145�C, and you will hold it there... do not rush this 
step of the distillation... and now just slowly collect the oil (1-2 
drops/second) until no more oil starts to come over, and you've shot at 
least 5�C past that temperature. So in my case I collect 145-150�C. With 
more experience, you can narrow that range to get even more pure safrole. 
A good visual indicator of a different fraction starting to come over, 
is there will be little "swirlies" in the receiving flask as the new 
liquid drips in. This is because the index of refraction of the next 
fraction is different.</p>

<p>Make a note of the temperature that your safrole comes over at.</p>

<p>If the temp that your safrole comes over is higher than 160�C check 
your seals on the tubing and glassware... more than likely there is a little
leak. If you're using an aspirator, and if you don't have good water 
pressure, you won't be able to get a good vacuum. Also, remember the 
Vaseline! Use an automotive vacuum gauge setup on a T-connector of your 
vacuum tubing if you suspect a leak, this will be able to quickly let 
you know if you're reaching near full vacuum each time. You should be 
getting at a very minimum, 28" of vacuum, and preferably higher.</p>

<p>At the end of the distillation, you should have a water white oil 
that really refracts light... and has a lovely smell... a little like 
licorice, a little like rootbeer, a nice potpourri smell... expect a 
yield of 75-90% safrole.</p>

<p>Now you have the fun job of cleaning the dishes. The best way is to 
use acetone to remove all the oils then wash with soapy water (if 
you feel it necessary). If there is any charring in your distilling 
flask, rinse with acetone, then let it soak in household ammonia or
10% sodium hydroxide for a few hours, then use a brush to easily scrub 
it out.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><b>Steps on building before you jump in:</b></p>

<div class="pic right">
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> 
<br>Example of a simple distillation setup.<br><br></p>
<img src="pictures/sdist.setup.gif">
</div>

<p><b>Step 1: </b>Once you get your distillation apparatus, set up your 
distillation apparatus on your bed before you try to put it together on the
stand. You will get a good idea about how the pieces go together, and 
become familiar with the fragility of the rig.

<p><b>Step 2: </b>Now you're ready to move it to the stand. Remember, this 
thing is build like a house.. bottom up. The boss-heads connect to the
3/8" or 1/2" steel rods that stand is made of and keep the clamps in 
place, the clamps will attached on both of the round bottom flasks, the
column and perhaps on the condenser as well. Read Zubrick for more advice
if you need more assistance.</p>

<p><b>Step 3: </b>Get practice distilling regular tap water using an oil 
bath. Make sure your condenser water is reliable whether is comes from
a recirculating fountain pump or from the tap, do not try to siphon 
water thru the condenser instead of using a pump or tap, although this 
technique works, it's too inconvenient and requires too much attention. 
Once you've done this, setup for regular fractional distillation and 
proceed.</p>

<p>The oil bath idea is simple... a metal bowl (do not use steel if you're 
using magnetic stirring as your stirrer will not function properly) with 
a flat bottom rests on the hotplate. It is filled with peanut or safflower 
oil. The distillation flask sits in the bowl but not touching the 
bottom, so that the hotplate heats the bowl, the bowl heats the oil, 
the oil heats the distillation flask. This is very effective, and 
although it will give off a bit of an oil smell, it's tolerable. And 
will be perfect for all your distillation needs... most especially if 
you do it under vacuum. You want even heating, especially if you're 
not using magnetic stirring. Be warned, if you're not using a vacuum
source to do this distillation I recommend not using this method. The
oil will smoke. Either use a heating mantle or a flat-bottomed flask
that is "tented" with aluminum foil. Rest the FB flask directly on the 
hot plate. Be very careful to remove the heat once the distillate it 
collected if you use this method, or you will scortch your flasks. While
on the subject of flat bottomed flasks, it should be mentioned to
NEVER use a large (>250ml) flat bottom flask under vacuum. The
risk of implosion is quite high.</p>

<p>The water should come across at 100�C, otherwise this indicates that 
your thermometer is off or the atmospheric pressure is significantly 
off in your area.</p>

<p><b>Step 4:</b>Try again with water, but now under vacuum, and note 
the temperature it comes over at.</p>

<p><b>Always</b> put a little Vaseline on the ground glass joints when 
doing a vacuum or high temperature distillation... this way they won't 
stick when you try to take them apart and will also let you know if 
you have a leak (air bubbles will be seen travelling thru the vaseline 
if you do have one). If you forget this advice and your joints freeze
together, free the stuck joints by evenly heating the outer joint with 
a lighter or propane torch. The glass should expand and you should be 
able to free each piece of glass.</p>

<p>This distillation with water will indicate the strength of your 
vacuum (see vacuum distillation notes at the end of this document) 
Once you know what your vacuum source can pull, then you can 
cross-reference it to when safrole should come over to know exactly 
what to keep and what to throw out when you do the distillation.</p>

<p>Remember, the flask is never directly heated in vacuum distillation, 
it can be heated with an "air bath" for regular distillation but it is
far too erratic for vacuum distillation.</p>


<p><b>Step 5: </b>You're now ready for sassafras! Go up and continue 
reading from the top. [Erowid Note: Edited to clarify that the oil here is 
NOT safrole based on reader feedback. July 2007.] If you <b>DON'T</b> think you're ready for 
sassafras, go buy some cheaper oil of star anise, and practice with 
it. Star Anise's oil, anethole, has very similar physical properties that
makes it useful for practicing techniques. It will come across at almost the 
same temperature as safrole. If you want to experiment more with 
the technique of fractional distillation, try distilling vodka or wine. Please note
that MDMA synthetic techniques using anethole can result in dangerous products
that are not MDMA. Anethole is NOT a substitute for safrole.</p>

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p><b>If you do not have a vigreux column:</b></p>

<p>Although it is preferable to use a short Vigreux column, distillation without a column will suffice as so long as you have magnetic stirring.</p>

<p><b>If you do not have the magnetic stirring:</b></p>

<p>If you do not have magnetic stirring, it will be much harder to do 
this distillation, but it is still possible. You must use a column or 
a Claisen adapter so that if you experience any heavy bumping, that 
the liquid will not spill over into the receiving flask. If you do 
not use magnetic stirring, add about 5g of very porous boiling stones 
made by breaking up pumice stone.</p>

<p>You can use room temperature water for your condenser. Note 
that four clamps are used in this setup, one at the distilling 
flask, one to secure the fractionating column, one to secure the 
condenser, one to secure the receiving flask. It is a good idea to 
use at least 3 clamps to hold this setup, any less is unsturdy. In this 
setup there is no thermometer adapter, as the three way adapter has 
one built in. Note the position of the thermometer bulb, this 
is where you want to place your thermometer. In this example boiling 
stones are shown being used, however it is more likely that you 
will be using magnetic stirring.</p>
