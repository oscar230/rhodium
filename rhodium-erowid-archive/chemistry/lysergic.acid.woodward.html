<h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Lysergic acid, the basic fragment derived from the ergot alkaloids, has 
      been synthesized in a fifteen-stage sequence beginning with 3-beta-carboxyethylindole. 
      The starting material was converted to the intermediate 1-benzoyl-5-keto-1,2,2a-3,4,5-hexahydrobenz-[cd]-indole 
      (<strong>4</strong>), containing three of the four rings present in lysergic 
      acid. This ketone in turn was transformed into the tetracyclic compound, 
      9-keto-7-methyl-4,5,5a,6,6a,7,8,9- octahydroindolo-[4.3-<em>fe</em>]-quinoline 
      (<strong>69</strong>), and thence to lysergic acid. The synthetic acid was 
      converted to dl-isolysergic acid hydrazide which had previously been resolved 
      and converted to ergonovine. The present work, therefore, completes also 
      the synthesis of this ergot alkaloid.</p>

</div>


  <p>The striking physiological properties of ergot early directed attention to 
    this remarkable product of the growth of the fungus <em>Claviceps Purpurea</em> 
    on rye grain. Pre-Christian allusions to its effects have been recorded, and 
    it was identified in 1676 as the causative agent of the dreaded medieval gangrenous 
    scourge, St. Anthony's Fire. The therapeutic powers of ergot were likewise 
    recognized during the middle ages. Its capacity to induce uterine contractions 
    was recorded as early as 1582, and crude preparations were introduced into 
    orthodox medicine early in the nineteenth century.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 
    However, its present important position in medical practice was made possible 
    only by the extensive researches of the past forty years on the isolation 
    and characterization of the pure active principles. These elegant investigations, 
    in which Arthur Stoll has played a dominant role,<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> 
    have led to the isolation of no less than six related bases all of which have 
    been shown to be amides of the same key substance, lysergic acid (<strong>1</strong>).<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 
    Of the natural bases, ergonovine (<strong>2</strong>) is a particularly simple 
    representative; the others-ergotamine (<strong>3</strong>, R=H; R'=- CH<sub>2</sub>-Ph), 
    ergosine (<strong>3</strong>, R=H; R'=-CH<sub>2</sub>CHMe<sub>2</sub>), ergocristine 
    (<strong>3</strong>, R=Me; R'=- CH<sub>2</sub>Ph), ergokryptine (<strong>3</strong>, 
    R=Me; R'=-CH<sub>2</sub>CHMe<sub>2</sub>), ergocornine (<strong>3</strong>, 
    R=Me; R'=Pr<sup>beta</sup>)-terminate in common in an unusual polypeptide 
    array.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  <p>Widespread interest in the synthesis of lysergic acid was stimulated even 
    before the structural issues were resolved in 1949. This attention was evoked 
    by the unique polycyclic system present in the acid and by the medical applications 
    of the derived natural bases. The synthesis of dihydrolysergic acid by Uhle 
    and Jacobs<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> was the first major accomplishment 
    in the synthetic studies, and this was followed by a number of attempts<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
    directed at lysergic acid itself. More recently, interest in the synthesis 
    has been heightened by the discovery of the startling capacity of the corresponding 
    diethylamide (LSD) to induce abnormal psychic states.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> 
    In this communication, we describe the synthesis of lysergic acid.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p>The presence within the lysergic acid skeleton of a beta-substituted indole 
    system and the ready availability of simple beta-substituted indoles suggested 
    such compounds as starting materials for synthetic work. However, the very 
    high reactivity of the hetero-ring of indole compounds seemed incompatible 
    with further extensive synthetic operations. Moreover, we were aware of the 
    possibility that many tricyclic indole intermediates (viz. various benz-[cd]-indoles) 
    would be susceptible to ready and irreversible isomerization to the more stable 
    naphthalenoid isomers.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In order to circumvent such problems, we adopted at the very outset the artifice of using dihydroindole derivatives.</p>

<h4>Synthesis of Tricyclic Ketone (4)</h4>

  <p>N-benzoyl-3-(beta-carboxyethyl)-dihydroindole (<strong>5</strong>)<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> 
    was converted by thionyl chloride in ether solution to the corresponding acid 
    chloride, and thence directly, by the action of aluminum chloride in carbon 
    disulfide or ethylene dichloride, to the ketone <strong>4</strong>. It is 
    of some interest that when the Friedel-Crafts reaction was carried out in 
    benzene solution, the sole product was the phenyl ketone <strong>6</strong>. 
    Attempts to effect direct cyclization of the acid <strong>5</strong> to <strong>4</strong> 
    with sulfuric acid or hydrogen fluoride were unsuccessful; with polyphosphoric 
    acid only a very small conversion was obtained. In another attempt to obtain 
    useful tricyclic intermediates, the oxalyl derivatives (<strong>7</strong>, 
    R=Me or Et) were prepared by condensation of the appropriate oxalic ester 
    with the corresponding ester of <strong>5</strong> in the presence of alkoxides. 
    When these esters were heated with 80% sulfuric acid, hydrolysis and decarboxylation 
    occurred smoothly, with the formation of the alpha-keto acid <strong>8</strong>, 
    but no cyclization to a dihydronaphthalene (<em>cf.</em> <strong>9</strong>) 
    was observed.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p>The tricyclic ketone <strong>4</strong> was hydrolyzed readily by aqueous 
    hydrochloric acid to the free base (<strong>10</strong>, R=H), which was dehydrogenated 
    by Pd/C in p-cymene to the known 5-keto-1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz-[cd]-indole 
    (<strong>11</strong>).<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>7a,7f</sup></a> On the other hand, <strong>4</strong> 
    itself, and the corresponding N-acetyl ketone (<strong>10</strong>, R=Ac), 
    which was prepared by either acetylation of (<strong>10</strong>, R=H), or 
    by aluminum chloride-catalyzed cyclization of the chloride of N-acetyl-3-(beta-carboxyethyl)-dihydroindole, 
    were dehydrogenated under similar conditions to the naphthalenoid compounds 
    (<strong>12</strong>, R=Bz or Ac). The stabilization of the naphthalene system 
    in the N-acetylated series as a result of the suppression of interaction between 
    the nitrogen atom and the carbonyl group in the ketonic isomers (<em>cf</em> 
    <strong>11</strong>, arrows) has been commented upon by Grob.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> 
    These dehydrogenation studies early in the work tended to confirm the soundness 
    of the synthetic approach based on dihydroindole derivatives. In addition 
    they indicated that the conversion to the indole system would have to be carried 
    out using compounds in which the nitrogen function was in the free base form.</p>

  <p>Most of the substances described in the present work fell into one or another 
    of several well-defined structural classes, which could be recognized readily 
    by characteristic ultraviolet and infrared spectra, and liberal use was made 
    of this valuable control. <em>The chromophoric systems in <strong>4</strong> 
    gave rise to absorption at 5.91 (ketone carbonyl) and 6.07mu (amide carbonyl) 
    in the infrared, and at 235 and 326mu in the ultraviolet (</em>cf <em>Fig.1</em>).</p>

<p>All of our subsequent synthetic experiments were based upon the tricyclic ketone 4, of an activated methylene
group at C-4, suggested that the construction of ring-D of lysergic acid might be initiated by the attachment
of the requisite nitrogen atom at the reactive position.</p>

  <p>The 4-bromo derivative <strong>13</strong>, an obvious intermediate for such 
    studies, was obtained in excellent yield by bromination of the tricyclic ketone 
    with either bromine or pyridine hydrobromide perbromide. However, early attempts 
    to utilize this compound in the alkylation of amines were unpromising. For 
    instance, the reaction of the bromo ketone <strong>13</strong> with methylamine, 
    even at RT took a complicated course and led in fairly good yield to the naphthalene 
    derivative <strong>14</strong>. In addition, initial experiments designed 
    to obtain the potentially useful ketal- ketone <strong>16</strong> by alkylation 
    of methylaminoacetone ethylene ketal <strong>15</strong> were likewise unsuccessful. 
    The side chain amine <strong>15</strong> was obtained by reaction of methylamine 
    with either chloro- or bromoacetone ethylene ketal.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> Further discussion 
    of these alkylations and of the ketal-ketone <strong>16</strong> will be deferred 
    until a later section.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, much of the early effort was directed toward the synthesis of 
    the alpha-amino ketone <strong>17</strong>. The preparation of the alpha-oximinoketone 
    <strong>18</strong> by condensation of <strong>4</strong> with butyl nitrite 
    in the presence of potassium ethoxide proceeded smoothly, but the desired 
    reaction of <strong>18</strong> could not be brought about. On the other hand, 
    treatment of the oxime of <strong>4</strong> with potassium ethoxide, followed 
    by acid, gave the desired 17, as hydrochloride, in good yield.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a> 
    The free base, however, decomposed immediately on liberation from its salt, 
    and in our hands was of little further synthetic utility. Another sequence 
    of reactions which led into the 4- amino series was initiated by condensation 
    of <strong>4</strong> with ethyl formate, or methyl oxalate, in the presence 
    of sodium methoxide. These reactions afforded <strong>19</strong> and <strong>20</strong>, 
    respectively.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a> When the hydroxymethylene compound <strong>19</strong> 
    was treated with hydrazoic acid in trifluoroacetic acid<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> in the 
    presence of sulfuric acid, the major product was the cyano-ketone <strong>21</strong>, 
    though the desired 4-formylaminoketone <strong>22</strong> was formed concomitantly 
    in low yield. Similar treatment of the methoxalyl compound <strong>20</strong> 
    gave the oxazole <strong>23</strong> in poor yield; the Schmidt reaction had 
    evidently proceed normally with subsequent cyclodehydration. Hydrolysis of 
    either the ester <strong>23</strong>, or the formylamino compound <strong>22</strong>, 
    gave the simple aminoketone <strong>24</strong>, which like <strong>17</strong> 
    was deemed too sensitive to be useful.</p>

  <p>In the hope that 4-alkylamino ketones might be prepared by the action of 
    amines on oxides of the type <strong>25</strong>, the ketone <strong>4</strong> 
    was converted into the enol acetate (<strong>26</strong>, R=Ac) and the enol 
    ether (<strong>26</strong>, R=Et) by the action of isopropenyl acetate and 
    ethyl orthoformate, respectively. When these enol derivatives were treated 
    with peracids, however, the product isolated was the hydroxyketone <strong>27</strong>.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

  <p>The simpler oxide <strong>29</strong> was prepared, however, by peroxidation 
    of the olefin <strong>28</strong>. The latter in turn was prepared from <strong>4</strong> 
    by reduction to the alcohol (<strong>30</strong>, R=OH) with sodium borohydride, 
    conversion to the bromide (<strong>30</strong>, R=Br) with phosphorus tribromide, 
    and dehydrohalogenation with collidine. The olefin <strong>28</strong> contains 
    the basic chromophoric system present in many subsequent compounds; <em>its 
    maximum absorption in the ultraviolet light is at 264mu (Fig. 2, curve A).</em> 
    The corresponding saturated compound <strong>31</strong>, is prepared from 
    <strong>28</strong> by hydrogenation, <em>absorbs at 267 and 292mu (Fig. 3, 
    curve A).</em> We further took advantage of having in hand these simple compounds 
    of known structure by replacing the N-benzoyl groups by N-acetyl functions. 
    <em>The resulting amide <strong>32</strong> possesses bands at 241, 254, 307 
    and 316mu (Fig. 2, curve B), while the bands of the saturated analog <strong>33</strong> 
    are at 213, 253, 279 and 289mu (Fig. 3, curve B).</em></p>

  <p>The oxide <strong>29</strong> was typical of its class in that is was readily 
    converted to a bromohydrin <strong>34</strong> with hydrogen bromide in benzene-ether, 
    and rearranged to the beta-tetralone (<strong>35</strong>) by magnesium bromide.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of greater synthetic interest was the smooth reaction of <strong>29</strong> 
    with amines. With methylamine at 100�C, for example, the simple alkanolamine 
    <strong>36</strong> was produced, while under similar conditions, methylaminoacetone 
    ethylene ketal <strong>15</strong> gave the ketal alcohol <strong>37</strong>.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>20</sup></a> 
    Numerous attempts to effect the oxidation of <strong>37</strong> to the corresponding 
    aminoketone <strong>16</strong> were unsuccessful. Reaction of <strong>36</strong> 
    with bromoacetone gave a substance which we formulate as the hemiketal <strong>38</strong> 
    in view of the absence of a carbonyl band below 6mu in its infrared spectrum, 
    and its ready conversion to a methyl ether <strong>29</strong> with methanolic 
    hydrogen chloride. The ether <strong>39</strong> was obtained also from <strong>37</strong> 
    by treatment with hydrogen chloride in methanol. Like <strong>37</strong>, 
    <strong>38</strong> could not be oxidized to any well- defined product.</p>

<h4>Addition of a carbon chain at C-5</h4>

  <p>An obvious alternative for building ring-D of lysergic acid involved the 
    elaboration of a carbon chain at C-5. The capacity of the carbonyl group in 
    the tricyclic ketone <strong>4</strong> to undergo addition reactions was 
    therefore utilized.</p>

  <p>The initial attempt in that direction involved the Reformatsky reaction. 
    When 4 was treated with methyl or ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of zinc, 
    and the resulting crude hydroxy-ester was warmed with formic acid, the unsaturated 
    ester (<strong>40</strong>, R=Me or Et) was obtained. The beta-gamma-position 
    of the double bond in these esters easily demonstrated by ultraviolet measurements 
    (<em>vide supra</em>). It is of some interest that only the unconjugated isomers 
    were isolated. The acid (<strong>40</strong>, R=H), obtained by careful alkaline 
    hydrolysis of either ester (<strong>40</strong>, R= Me or Et), was then converted 
    to the bromoketone <strong>41</strong> in excellent yield through successive 
    treatments with oxalyl chloride in toluene, diazomethane in DCM and aqueous 
    hydrobromic acid. Reduction of the bromoketone with sodium borohydride furnished 
    directly the oxide <strong>42</strong>; clearly the medium was sufficiently 
    basic to effect dehydrobromination of the intermediary bromohydrin. Perbenzoic 
    aid was then used to effect addition of an oxygen atom to the isolated double 
    bond of <strong>42</strong>, and the dioxide <strong>43</strong> was obtained.</p>

  <p>With methylamine at 100�C, the latter yielded an amorphous, tertiary, tetracyclic 
    base, characterized as the crystalline methiodide. There is little doubt that 
    the substance possesses the structure <strong>44</strong>, and in view of 
    its close relation to other tetracyclic substances, described below, it seems 
    likely that intensive further investigation should have enabled us to connect 
    this series with our other synthetic routes. However, the low overall yield 
    in the conversion of <strong>4</strong> to <strong>44</strong>, which may 
    be attributed in the main to an insufficient opportunity for stereochemical 
    control, and the availability of superior paths, led us not to make the effort.</p>
  <p>Another attempt to utilize the Reformatsky ester (<strong>40</strong>, R=Me) 
    foundered early on a point of sufficient interest to merit description.</p>

  <p>Conversion of the corresponding oxide <strong>45</strong> was easily effected 
    by monoperphthalic acid. We hoped that <strong>45</strong> would yield the 
    diester <strong>46</strong> on treatment with sarcosine methyl ester and were 
    encouraged by the observation that methylamine at 100�C gave the lactam <strong>47</strong>. 
    However, the changes depicted in (<strong>48</strong>, arrows) occurred so 
    readily in the experiment with sarcosine ester that the lactone <strong>49</strong> 
    was the sole product.</p>

<h4>The Unsaturated Aldehyde 50</h4>

  <p>The unsaturated aldehyde <strong>50</strong> containing as it does a very 
    reactive carbonyl group, and a point of entry for the introduction of substituents 
    at C-4, occupied a central position in many schemes for the elaboration of 
    ring- D. Furthermore, it was found to be readily preparable from the tricyclic 
    ketone <strong>4</strong>, through the corresponding glycidic ester (<strong>51</strong>, 
    R=Et) obtained from the ketone by treatment with ethyl chloroacetate in the 
    presence of potassium t-butoxide.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a> The ester was smoothly hydrolyzed 
    to the sodium salt (<strong>51</strong>, R=Na), which was converted to the 
    saturated aldehyde <strong>52</strong> with mineral acids, or directly to 
    derivatives of that compound with appropriate carbonyl reagents. Our major 
    interest in the sodium salt, however, was excited by the observation that 
    it gave the semicarbazone of <strong>50</strong> simply and in high yield 
    when it was treated successively, in acetonitrile solution, with pyridine 
    hydrobromide perbromide and semicarbazide.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>22</sup></a> The free aldehyde 
    <strong>50</strong> was readily obtained from the derivative by exchange of 
    the semicarbazide residue to pyruvic acid.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

  <p>The synthetic opportunities presented by the unsaturated aldehyde were exploited, 
    <em>inter alia,</em> in at least three directions<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>24</sup></a>;</p>

  <p><strong>i.</strong> With ethylene glycol and toluenesulfonic acid, the aldehyde 
    was converted to the ethylene acetal <strong>53</strong>, which was smoothly 
    oxidized by perbenzoic acid to the oxide <strong>54</strong>. The latter reacted 
    with methylamine at 120�C to give the base <strong>55</strong>, which in turn 
    combined readily with acrylonitrile to give <strong>56</strong>. It will not 
    be difficult to imagine the uses to which we wished to put the nitrile <strong>56</strong>; 
    but the recalcitrance of the acetal function stood in the way of all of them. 
    With methanolic hydrogen chloride, for example, the ester <strong>57</strong> 
    was formed, while 6N HCl acid gave <strong>58</strong>; hot 90% acetic acid 
    removed the beta-cyanoethyl chain, and gave the familiar <strong>55</strong>. 
    Attempts to remove the offending function by more brutal means led only to 
    deep-seated changes of no utility.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

  <p><strong>ii.</strong> The unsaturated nitrile <strong>59</strong> was easily 
    obtained from the aldehyde <strong>50</strong>, through treatment of the corresponding 
    oxime with thionyl chloride. Conversion of the 4,5-double bond to an oxide 
    function, by means of alkaline hydrogen peroxide, was accompanied by hydration 
    of the nitrile group, and the epoxyamide <strong>60</strong> was obtained 
    in substantially quantitative yield. Like other 4,5-oxides, <strong>60</strong> 
    was susceptible to attack by amines; with methylaminoacetone ethylene ketal, 
    the base <strong>61</strong> was readily obtained. The remaining task in this 
    series in the conversion of the alpha-hydroxyamide function to a carbonyl 
    group. It remains undone; the most novel of the various results obtained in 
    this effort was the formation of the pentacyclic lactone <strong>62</strong> 
    when the amide was treated with red lead oxide in acetic acid, in an attempt 
    to bring about oxidative cleavage of the group at C-5.</p>

  <p><strong>iii.</strong> The aldehyde <strong>50</strong> was converted to the 
    epoxy alcohol <strong>64</strong> by either of two methods. In the first, 
    and preferred method, alkaline hydrogen peroxide was used to convert the aldehyde 
    to the corresponding oxide <strong>63</strong>, which was then reduced with 
    sodium borohydride. Alternatively, the latter reagent was used to convert 
    <strong>50</strong> to the unsaturated alcohol <strong>65</strong>, which 
    was oxidized to <strong>64</strong> by perbenzoic acid. This method suffered 
    from the concomitant formation of a certain amount of the dihydro alcohol 
    <strong>66</strong> in the reduction step. Although this difficulty was overcome 
    by the use of Ponndorf reaction, the oxidation stage was relatively inefficient.</p>

  <p>Reaction of the epoxyalcohol <strong>64</strong> with methylaminoacetone 
    ethylene ketal <strong>15</strong> gave, although poor yield, the desired 
    amino glycol <strong>67</strong>, which was very smoothly oxidized to the 
    ketone <strong>16</strong> by slightly more than one mole of periodate in 
    acid solution.</p>  
  <p>The important intermediate ketal-ketone <strong>16</strong> thus became available 
    in an eleven-stage sequence from the tricyclic ketone <strong>4</strong>. 
    However, both the length and the inefficiency of this route led us once again 
    to re- examine the possible direct preparation of <strong>16</strong> from 
    the bromoketone <strong>13</strong>. In a new series of experiments it was 
    discovered that reaction of <strong>13</strong> with methylaminoacetone ethylene 
    ketal <strong>15</strong> <em>in a non-polar solvent</em> afforded the ketal-ketone 
    <strong>16</strong> in excellent yield. The cumbersome earlier route, therefore, 
    could be abandoned.</p>

<h4>The Tetracyclic Series</h4>

  <p>With the obtention of the ketone <strong>16</strong>, the stage was set for 
    entry into the tetracyclic phase of our work. Thus, it may be noted that the 
    intermediate contains, actually or potentially, all of the functions necessary 
    for closure of ring-D, and for attachment of the lysergic acid carboxyl group 
    as well.</p>

  <p>The first step was taken with the hydrolysis of <strong>16</strong> to the 
    diketone <strong>68</strong>, best effected by treatment with 6N HCl acid.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>25</sup></a> 
    The diketone was then smoothly cyclized, by sodium methoxide in absolute ethanol, 
    to the tetracyclic unsaturated ketone <strong>69</strong>, which in turn was 
    converted to the protected unsaturated alcohol <strong>70</strong>, by successive 
    treatments with acetic anhydride and sodium borohydride, or vice-versa<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It was now necessary to replace the hydroxyl function in <strong>70</strong> 
    by a carboxyl group. An initial attempt in that direction was based on the 
    observation of Price and Krishnamurti<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>27</sup></a> that 
    allyl alcohol is easily and directly converted to allyl cyanide by treatment 
    with cuprous cyanide in concentrated hydrochloric acid. However, when the 
    allylic alcohol <strong>70</strong> was treated under similar conditions with 
    the aim of exchanging -OH for - CN, it was transformed simply into the epimeric 
    alcohol <strong>71</strong>.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the result was encouraging insofar as it suggested that carbonium 
    ion reactions at C-9 were practicable. We next treated the alcohol <strong>70</strong> 
    with liquid hydrogen cyanide in the presence of boron fluoride etherate. Perhaps 
    not without analogy,<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>29</sup></a> this reaction led to 
    the very smooth production of the formylamino compound <strong>72</strong>.</p>

  <p>Our attention was then directed to the preparation of the chloride <strong>73</strong>, 
    and after a series of experiments in a number of solvents it was found to 
    be readily prepared as its hydrochloride, by the action of thionyl chloride 
    on <strong>70</strong> in liquid sulfur dioxide. The chloride was extraordinarily 
    susceptible to hydrolysis to the alcohol <strong>71</strong>, and initial 
    attempts to replace the chlorine atom by a cyano group in hydroxylic solvents 
    were seriously complicated by the formation of the alcohol <strong>71</strong> 
    and corresponding ethers. The difficultly was surmounted by treating the hydrochloride 
    of <strong>73</strong> with excess sodium cyanide, under which conditions 
    the desired nitrile <strong>74</strong> was formed in good yield. Methanolysis 
    of <strong>74</strong> catalyzed by sulfuric acid gave the ester (<strong>75</strong>, 
    R=Me), which was hydrolyzed by HCl acid or by sodium hydroxide to the corresponding 
    acid (<strong>75</strong>, R=H).</p>

  <p>Two hydrogen atoms, placed by design at C-5 and C-5a to deprive our synthetic 
    operations of the dangers attendant upon the presence of an indole ring, now 
    alone remained to be eliminated. The position of these atoms, as components 
    of a dihydroaromatic system, provided a basis for supposing that they should 
    be relatively readily removed, and dehydrogenation studies were taken in hand. 
    As was the case in our earlier experiences with related N-acyl derivatives 
    (<em>vide supra</em>, <strong>10</strong> to <strong>12</strong>), the N-acetyl 
    derivative of the ester (<strong>75</strong>, R=Me) was converted by Pd/C 
    in boiling xylene to the known naphthalenoid compound <strong>76</strong>.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>30</sup></a> 
    On the other hand, when the sodium salt of the acid (<strong>75</strong>, 
    R=H) was treated in boiling water with Raney nickel, disproportionation occurred, 
    with formation of <strong>77</strong>. Under these conditions generation of 
    the desired indole system was accomplished, but reduction of the double bond 
    in ring-D took place as well.</p>

  <p>Subsequent studies obviated these difficulties; in similar experiments in which 
    heat-deactivated Raney nickel was used as dehydrogenation catalyst in the 
    presence of sodium arsenate,<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>31</sup></a> dl-lysergic acid (<strong>78</strong>) 
    was the sole product isolated.</p>

  <p>The synthetic <em>dl</em>-lysergic acid was converted through its methyl 
    ester, into <em>dl</em>-isolysergic acid hydrazide.<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>32</sup></a> 
    The acid and the hydrazide were shown to be identical with samples prepared<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>32,33</sup></a> 
    from natural materials by comparison of melting points, mixture melting points, 
    infrared and ultraviolet spectra, X-ray powder diagrams, pKa's, and paper 
    chromatographic behavior.</p>

  <p>Since <em>dl</em>-isolysergic acid hydrazide has already been resolved and 
    converted to ergonovine <strong>2</strong>,<a href="lysergic.acid.woodward.html#refs"><sup>34</sup></a>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

    <p>Melting points were determined in soft glass capillary tubes and are uncorrected. 
      Ultraviolet and infrared measurements were used for control purposes throughout 
      the investigation, and spectra of all pure substances prepared were determined. 
      However, in the sequel, spectra are recorded ordinarily only for the substances 
      in the main line of the synthesis and for key model compounds. In each case 
      in the infrared measurements, the abscissa is plotted in wave lengths (2.6-12mu) 
      and the ordinate in percentage transmission (0-100%). The measurements were 
      made on a Beckman IR 2-T automatic recording spetrophotometer. Determinations 
      were run at 0.15 molar concentration in chloroform solution except those 
      designated with an "M" on the curve. In the latter a mineral oil mull was 
      used. Ultraviolet data were obtained in methanol solution using a Cary model 
      11 automatic recording spectrophotometer.</p>

      for the determination of its structure. Their deductions were incomplete 
      only in respect to the placing of one double bond, and stereochemical points.

No other authentic members of this class are known, and it may be questioned whether factors are present in these molecules which would confer on the ortho amide structures stability vis-a-vis the ring chain tautomeric isomers (i). It is of interest that the large-ring lactone structure (i), earlier considered favorably by Stoll was first suggested by Barger as long ago as 1938 (Barger, &quot;Handbuch der experimentellen Pharmakologie&quot;, suppl. Vol. VI, (1938), pp. 84, 221). Attention may be directed here to the presence of large lactone rings in a number of other metabolic products of microorganisms [enneatin A and B: Pl. A.

	<li><span class="oli">We considered that this possibility would apply generally to any intermediate containing the tricyclic system (ii), and one additional double bond. Our presumption of the greater stability of the naphthalenoid isomers was based on the fact the resonance energy of naphthalene in much greater than that of indole [L. Pauling, &quot;The Nature of the Chemical Bond&quot;, Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca, N.Y., (1942)]. It has been amply justified by subsequent events. Thus, lysergic acid itself falls into the above category, and has recently been found to suffer ready irreversible isomerization to (iii) in the presence of acids (ref. 7d). Furthermore, at least two attempts by other groups (ref. 7d and 7e) to synthesize lysergic acid were based apparently on the opposite presumption, i.e., isomerization of (iii) to 1, but such an isomerization could not be effected after (iii) had been obtained by synthesis.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">So far as we are aware, there are no previous instances of this reaction sequence, in which advantage is taken of the intermediacy of an enolate in the decarboxylation of glycidates:  The dehydrobromination, induced by semicarbazide, follows well-explored paths [W. McGuckin and E. Kendall, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 74, 5311, (1952)].</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">E. Hershberg, JOC, 13, 542, (1948)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">We contemplated the possibility of constructing the desired system in a single step, using the aldehyde 50 in a "quasi-physiological" reaction with methylaminomethylmalonic acid (cf. (iv) to (v)) or suitable components for, or equivalents of that substance. However, a number of attempts to reduce this conception to practice were uneventful. Indeed, the aldehyde was uniformly disappointing in all reactions with simple amines or with active methylene compounds; in the former case, prior to the reaction at the aldehyde group, rather than at C-4, seemed to be the rule and, in all cases, dehydrogenation (or disproportionation) with formation of naphthalene derivatives was a complicating factor.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Other instances are available of the difficulty of hydrolyzing acetals and ketals neighbored by a basic nitrogen atom [R. Moggridge and A. Neuberger, J. Chem. Soc. 745, (1938); C. Grob and H. Utzinger, Helv. Chim. Acta., 37, 1256, (1954)]. The basis for such behavior is reasonable: the usual easy heterolytic cleavage of the C-O bond in such substances involved the generation of a stablilized cation (cf (vi) to (vii)) the formation of which is strongly suppressed by a proximate N+. In the case at hand, the positive pole engendered by the presence of a hydroxyl group, and perhaps also steric and hindrance effects, must enhance the difficulty. It will be noted, nevertheless, that an important later stage in our synthesis involves the hydrolysis of a basic ketal [vide infra. (16-68)].</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">It is worthy to note that the ketones of this series are susceptible to very ready aerial oxidation. Thus, in an attempt to effect the acetylation of 68 with acetic anhydride in methanol, the sole product isolated was (viii). Special attention may be directed to the facile dehydrogenation of the N-acetyl derivative of the tetracyclic ketone 69 to the interesting betaine (ix), and the reduction of the latter by sodium borohydride to an unsaturated alcohol (x) isomeric with 70.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">C. Price and I Krishnamurti, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 72, 5334, (1950).</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">The stereochemistry implied in the formula 70 and 71, and the complete solution, symbolized for 71 in (xi) may be developed as follows: 
		<br>(a) the tightly fused A/B/C ring system can be constructed only with a quasi-axial hydrogen atom at C-5a. 
		<br>(b) C-6a will enjoy the more stable of the two possible orientations, i.e., that containing a quasi-equatorial C-N bond; since opportunities for equilibration have been provided  in both the tricyclic and tetracyclic classes (cf. 68 and 69), by the proximity of a carbonyl or a vinylogous carbonyl function. 
		<br>(c) sodium borohydride reduction of the carbonyl groups ordinarily leads to equatorial alcohols (cf 70); 
		<br>furthermore, the relative basicity of 70, (pKa, 6.02) and 71 (pKa, 6.68) confirms our assignment, in that stablilization of the conjugate acid by hydrogen bonding is possible in the stronger base 71, but not in 70. A related case, that of quinine and epiquinine, is discussed by R. Turner and R.Woodward (R. Manske and H. Holmes, &quot;The Alkaloids&quot;, Academic Press, Inc, N.Y., N.Y., (1953), p. 32.). Assignment of the configuration of the epimeric 10-hydroxydihydrodesoxycodienes was recently made in a similar fashion [H. Rapoport and S. Masamune, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 77, 4330, (1955).]</span></li>
