<p>Treatment of o-vanillin <strong>21</strong> with bromine in a mixture of sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid gave 5-Bromo-3-methoxysalicylaldehyde <strong>22</strong><a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, which was subjected to Dakin oxidation
conditions to give 3,4-Dihydroxy-5-methoxybromobenzene <strong>23</strong><a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. Methylenation of <strong>23</strong> gave the known 3,4-Methylenedioxy-5-methoxybromobenzene <strong>24</strong><a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>5-Bromo-3-methoxysalicylaldehyde (22)</h4>

<p>To a solution of <strong>21</strong> (73.7 g, 0.48 mmol) and sodium acetate (60 g, 0.73 mmol) in acetic acid (1.8 L) was added bromine (25 mL, 0.48 mmol) in acetic acid (20 mL). The
resultant yellow solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Acetic acid was evaporated in vacuo, and
the residue was partitioned between CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (1 L) and H<sub>2</sub>O (1 L). The organic phase was washed with H<sub>2</sub>O
(2x1 L), dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and evaporated in vacuo to leave a brown solid. Recrystallization from acetic acid/H<sub>2</sub>O
gave <strong>22</strong> (96.2 g, 0.416 mol, 86%) as yellow needles, R<sub>f</sub> 0.53 (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/hexanes 4:1); mp 122-124�C (lit<a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> 128-129�C).</p>

<h4>3,4-Dihydroxy-5-methoxybromobenzene (23)</h4>

<p>To a solution of <strong>22</strong> (20 g, 86.6 mmol) in 2% NaOH (425 mL) at room temperature was added a solution of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (54 g, 476 mmol) in H<sub>2</sub>O (510 mL).
The mixture turned a deep purple color and was left to stir for 30 min; 2M HCl (50 mL) was added and the
solution lightened to a pale pink color. The aqueous solution was extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (4x250 mL). The
combined extracts were washed with saturated aqueous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (2x500 mL), and dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).
Evaporation in vacuo gave crude <strong>23</strong> (16.8 g, 77 mmol, 89%) as a white solid, R<sub>f</sub> 0.28 (hexanes/EtOAc 7:3); mp 72-74�C (lit<a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 74-76�C).</p>

<h4>3,4-Methylenedioxy-5-methoxybromobenzene (24)</h4>

<p>To a mixture of <strong>23</strong> (20 g, 90.9 mmol) in DMF (230 mL) and K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (18.9 g, 136 mmol) was added bromochloromethane (6.6 mL, 100 mmol). The
mixture was warmed to 80�C for 2 h during which time it turned a dirty green color. A further portion of
bromochloromethane (6.6 mL, 100 mmol) was added and heating continued for 1 h. The solution was allowed
to cool, diluted with H<sub>2</sub>O (230 mL) and extracted with Et<sub>2</sub>O (3x250 mL). The combined ethereal layers were
washed with brine (200 ml) and dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>). Evaporation in vacuo yielded crude product, which was
purified by chromatography over silica gel eluting with hexanes/Et<sub>2</sub>O (9:1). Recrystallization from Et<sub>2</sub>O/hexanes
gave <strong>24</strong> (17.67 g, 76.5 mmol, 85%) as white crystals, R<sub>f</sub> 0.66 (hexanes/Et<sub>2</sub>O 4:1); mp 80-81�C (lit<a href="34-md-5-meo-phbr.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> 78-79�C).</p>
