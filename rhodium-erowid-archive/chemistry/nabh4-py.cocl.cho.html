<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>By use of sodium borohydride in N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing a molar excess of pyridine as a borane scavenger, direct conversion of both aliphatic and aromatic acid chlorides to the corresponding aldehydes can be achieved in >70% yield with minimal (5-10%) alcohol formation.</p> 

</div>
<p>One of the most useful synthetic transformations in organic synthesis is the conversion of an acid chloride to the corresponding aldehyde without overreduction to the alcohol. Until recently, this type of selective reduction was difficult to accomplish and was most frequently effected by catalytic hydrogenation (the Rosenmund reduction<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>). However, in the past few years, several novel reducing agents have been developed<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> to accomplish the desired transformation.</p>

<p>In view of its selectivity as a reducing agent, ease of handling, and low cost, sodium borohydride would seem to be an attractive reagent for effecting the selective reduction of an acid chloride to an aldehyde. However, the latter transformation was consistently reported to occur with overreduction to the alcohol until Johnstone and coworkers<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> discovered that the intermediate aldehyde could indeed be isolated in fair to good yield if such reductions are conducted at 0�C in acetonitrile in the presence of certain metal ions complexed with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). In the absence of metal salts aldehydes were isolated, albeit in low yield, only if the reduction was effected at -70�C.</p>

<p>Since this metal-assisted borohydride reduction of acyl halides suffers from low to moderate yields (24-58%) obtained with aliphatic compounds and results in a significant amount (always >10%) of alcohol from overreduction, we decided to investigate the reaction further. Our initial studies<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> revealed that sodium borohydride in a mixture of DMF-tetrahydrofuran (THF) is capable of converting both aliphatic and aromatic acyl chlorides to the corresponding aldehydes in high yield without the presence of any additional metal salts if the reaction is quenched by use of a mixture of propionic acid - dilute hydrochloric acid - ethyl vinyl ether. Unfortunately, aldehydes could be isolated in good yield using this methodology only if the reaction was conducted at low temperature. For example, treatment<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> of <em>o</em>-chlorobenzoyl chloride with sodium borohydride in DMF - THF at -70�C afforded a product mixture containing the corresponding aldehyde and alcohol in a 5:1 ratio. However, a similar experiment<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> conducted at 0�C resulted in a substantial amount of overreduction since <em>o</em>-chlorobenzyl alcohol comprised 75% of the product mixture. Somewhat unexpectedly, doubling the reaction time prior to the quench had little effect on the overreduction in the latter reaction an indication that overreduction might be occurring during the quench. Since the procedures used in quenching the reactions at -70�C and 0�C were virtually identical<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, this disparity of results offers further evidence<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> of the stability of the initial reaction intermediate (<strong>1</strong>) at -70�C (and lack thereof, with generation of borane, at 0�C).</p>

<p>In addition to the disadvantage of requiring a low reaction temperature, our previous methodology<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> presented two other difficulties. The aldehydes in all cases were contaminated with varying amounts of material derived from ethyl vinyl ether; and the unusual quench presented a serious hazard due to the vigorous evolution of hydrogen. This communication reports that such problems can be circumvented if the reduction is effected in the presence of pyridine, which serves as an efficient scavenger of the borane presumably liberated<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> if the reaction is conducted at 0�C.</p>

</div>

<p>In contrast to the results obtained at 0�C in the absence of pyridine, it was found that treatment of <em>o</em>-chlorobenzoyl chloride with sodium borohydride in DMF-THF containing a molar excess of pyridine using a procedure only slightly different<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> from that described below afforded the corresponding aldehyde contaminated with less than 20% of the corresponding alcohol. Accompanying these two products was a substantial amount of pyridine borane (<strong>2</strong>)<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>. The apparent stability of the latter compound (<strong>2</strong>) in the presence of the aldehyde is consistent with the known<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> properties of this reducing agent	i.e., it reduces aldehydes and ketones only at elevated temperature. Since pyridine borane is virtually insoluble in water and very soluble in ether, a chromatographic separation seemed called for. Unexpectedly, when the aldehyde-pyridine borane mixture was applied neat to a column of Florisil<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>, rapid elution with 84:16 hexane/ether did succeed in leaving pyridine borane on the column but afforded a 95:5 mixture of alcohol:aldehyde! Equally frustrating were attempts to destroy pyridine borane with strongly acidic quenches (20mL of 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid; 20mL of propionic acid- 9mL of 4M aqueous hydrochloric acid) prior to reaction workup. Such efforts consistently led to a reaction product in which only alcohol could be detected by both NMR and IR analysis! In retrospect, such observations are consistent with the enhanced reducing properties amine borane complexes are known<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> to exhibit in the presence of Lewis acids.</p>

<p>Eventually a facile method (see the following procedure) was developed to remove pyridine borane in a non-destructive manner from the reaction mixture prior to isolation of the aldehyde. As the results in <strong>Table I</strong> indicate, this methodology seems to be applicable to both aromatic and aliphatic acid chlorides. A more detailed study of this reduction, including its scope and use of other types of borane scavengers<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>, is presently being initiated and results will be reported in a future article.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><strong>Standard Reduction Procedure</strong><a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a></p> 
<p>To a solution of 129 mg (3.4 mmoles) of sodium borohydride and 2.0 mL of pyridine in 5.0 mL of DMF and 3.0 mL of anhydrous THF cooled to approximately 0�C (external bath temperature) was added rapidly (<5 seconds) a solution of 4.0 mmoles of an acyl chloride in 2.0 mL of anhydrous THF. This mixture was subsequently stirred at 0�C for 1 minute before 0.50 mL of water was added to the flask to hydrolyze the excess acid chloride. Stirring of this mixture was continued at 0�C for an additional 60 seconds, after which 50 mL of 4:1 (v/v) hexane: solvent ether was quickly introduced into the flask. The globules of pyridine borane which appeared at this point can be separated from the reaction product by rapid filtration of the reaction mixture through a small column of Florisil (25 mL). An additional 25 mL portion of 4:1 (v/v) hexane: solvent ether was used to rinse out the reaction flask and ensure quantitative elution of the desired aldehyde (and any of the corresponding alcohol<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>) from the Florisil column<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>. 25 mL of ether was added to the combined filtrate, and this organic phase was washed successively with 15% aqueous NaCl (2x100mL), 1:1 (v/v) 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid:brine (1x100mL), 4:1 (v/v) 1M aqueous NaOH:brine (2x100mL), and saturated brine (100 ml). The organic layer was then dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and the solvent removed in vacuo.</p>

	<li><span class="oli">Previous experiments<a href="nabh4-py.cocl.cho.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> had demonstrated that surprisingly no precipitate of sodium chloride was observed if slightly less than one molar equivalent of NaBH<sub>4</sub> was utilized for the reduction of acyl chlorides at -70�C an indication that the initial reaction intermediate (<strong>1</strong>) might be stable under these conditions. In sharp contrast, similar reductions at 0�C led to instantaneous formation of a white precipitate (presumably NaCl).</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Results of studies conducted at 0�C using <em>o</em>-chlorobenzoyl chloride appear to indicate that pyridine borane (<strong>2</strong>) may actually be formed by direct reaction between pyridine and intermediate <strong>1</strong> (prior to its collapse). For example, if the addition of pyridine was delayed until 1 minute after the addition of the acid chloride, the product mixture contained approximately 90% alcohol. No significant decrease in overreduction was observed if 1-2 minutes was allotted after addition of pyridine before the quench with 0.5 mL of water. Apparently the reaction between pyridine and borane (once liberated) is not that facile under these conditions.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">The procedure was identical to that described in this communication with the following exceptions: (<strong>a</strong>) the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 mL of solvent ether one minute after the addition of 0.50 mL of water; (<strong>b</strong>) no filtration through Florisil was performed; and (<strong>c</strong>) the 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid:brine wash was omitted.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Ethyl vinyl ether has now been shown to be much less effective than pyridine in preventing overreduction of the aldehyde during the reaction quench.
