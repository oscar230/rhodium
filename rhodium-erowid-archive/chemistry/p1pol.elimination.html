  <p>Dehydration of Phenyl-1-propanol with any suitable catalyst like <a href="p1pol.elimination.html#tsoh">p-Toluenesulfonic 
    Acid</a> or <a href="p1pol.elimination.html#khso4">Potassium Hydrogen Sulfate</a> will eliminate 
    water from the alcohol, resulting in the formation of a high yield (80%+) 
    of propenylbenzene (a.k.a. &beta;-Methylstyrene or 1-phenylpropene), which 
    is an excellent precursor for the synthesis of <a href="p2p.phenylpropenes.html">phenyl-2-propanone</a>, 
    (meth)amphetamine, cathinones as well as <a href="ppa.synthesis.html">ephedrine 
    alkaloids</a>.</p>

  <p>This general procedure is not limited to the preparation of solely unsubstituted 
    propenylbenzenes, as it has successfully been used in the past for other analogs<a href="p1pol.elimination.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Dehydration of Phenyl-1-propanol to Propenylbenzene</h3>

<a name="tsoh"></a>
<h4>Using p-Toluenesulfonic Acid</h4>

<p>50.3g (0.369 mol) redistilled Phenyl-1-propanol (P-1-Pol), 1.002g p-Toluenesulfonic acid and approx 150ml Toluene was placed in a 500 mL two-necked RBF with stir bar 
and thermometer in one neck just to see the vapor temperature, then up for reflux with a Dean-Stark trap.</p>

<p>Oil bath was set to 130�C and reflux rate was less than 2 drops/sec. Reflux slowed when 6.2ml of H<sub>2</sub>O was collected. Vapor temperature climbed from 113�C to 
116�C and oil bath climbed to 140�C with reflux starting again, washing the rest of the water droplets from the condenser and surrounding area into the trap. Heat was 
stopped and a total of 6.5ml H<sub>2</sub>O was collected. This took about 4 hours.</p>

<p>The solution was transferred to a 500ml separation funnel and washed with 65ml 10% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> then 65ml Brine. The solution was a clear light yellow, and this 
was poured into a 400ml beaker with stir bar and dried with some CaCl<sub>2</sub>, then filtered into a 500ml RBF and set up for fractional distillation with a Claisen 
adaptor packed with Raschig rings. The oil bath was heated to 70�C and the toluene was removed by vacuum distillation.</p>

<p>The residue was cooled and transferred to a 100ml RBF and the 500ml flask was washed with a little toluene, which was added to the solution in the small RBF. The 100ml 
RBF was heated at atm pressure to collect the last of the Toluene, then at 174�C-175�C came the propenylbenzene (Oil bath was at 210�C). When nothing more distilled over 
at that temp, vacuum was applied to get the last drops over, resulting in a total recovery of 34.2g propenylbenzene (78.4% yield) and in the distillation flask 6.7g of a 
brown viscous mushy liquid remained, which upon testing was found to be acid to litmus.</p>

<a name="khso4"></a>
<h4>Using Potassium Hydrogen Sulfate</h4>

<p>55g Phenyl-1-propanol, with all DCM removed, was placed in a 250ml RBF with stir bar, and 1.2g KHSO<sub>4</sub> was added and set up for simple distillation using a 
recovery tube instead of a distillation head.</p>

<p>With oil bath at 147�C, small bubbles were seen. At 158�C, water began forming in the recovery tube and falling back into the flask causing fizzing and white smoke. 
This problem was effectively curtailed by the use of a heat gun aimed at the recovery tube every time water appeared.</p>

<p>At about 183�C, the water droplets started to appear oily. At 198�C no more water was seen to evolve and propenylbenzene started coming over (along with water), but no 
more need for the heat gun. Over 205-210�C, the benzene was coming over fast, then slowed.</p>

<p>The oil bath was taken up to 220�C when the rest of the benzene appeared to come over. After that, the temp was taken to 228�C when a light yellow liquid appeared and 
distillation was stopped. 56.7g total was collected and 2.8g remained in the reaction flask.</p>

<p>Transferred to a 250ml sep funnel, ~6.1g water was separated and the propenylbenzene was drained into a 250ml Erlenmeyer flask, the receiver flask and sep funnel was 
washed with 10ml DCM, which was then combined with the propenylbenzene.</p>

<p>Added some CaCl<sub>2</sub>, left for an hour and filtered into a 100ml RBF with stir bar. Washed the Erlenmeyer flask and filter cake with 3x20ml DCM and added these 
washes to the propenylbenzene as well.</p>

<p>Set up for fractional vacuum distillation, the DCM evaporated at a bath temp of 50�C, and then at a temp of 54�C, the product distilled over at 42-43�C/5.5 mbar to 
give  crystal clear propenylbenzene in a yield of 83.8%. Yeah!</p>

<p>Better than I've ever done and I feel sure I can get over 90%. I have a feeling that water falling back into the reaction flask lowers the yield and some white stuff 
can be seen in the condenser and recovery tube when this happens. Using a distillation head and thermometer will guarantee the water falling back in, even with a heat 
gun. Heat tape is a probably an even better idea.</p>
