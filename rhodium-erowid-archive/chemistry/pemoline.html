<p><strong>The Pemoline Molecule</strong></p>
</div>

  <p>Pemoline, first synthesized in 1913<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, is a
    CNS stimulant of the lesser known chemical family of oxazolines. The only
    other widely known member of this family is 4-Methylaminorex (a.k.a. 4-MAR,
    or &quot;U4Euh&quot;). Other than chemically, Pemoline differs from other
    stimulants in that it has very few symphatomimetic side effects, such as dry
    mouth, cardiac stress, or dilated pupils. It does not posess the jitteriness
    of caffeine either. The exact mechanism or site of action, via which pemoline
    acts, is not known with certainity, many studies indicate that it acts through
    dopaminergic mechanisms.</p>

<p>Clinically, in treating ADHD, Pemoline is normally given in dosages
ranging between 37.5 and 75mg daily, with the maximum reccommended daily
dose being 112.5 mg. Peak serum levels after single doses are reached
within 2 to 4 hours and the serum half-life is approximately 12 hours.
As Pemoline is insoluble in water, the powder is essentially tasteless.
Pemoline is about five times as strong a CNS stimulant as caffeine,
slightly stronger than methylphenidate (Ritalin) and but is not as strong
as methamphetamine<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. Pemoline does not
suppress appetite like most other stimulants<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.
The LD<sub>50</sub> of both Pemoline and its magnesium complex is 550
mg/kg in rats<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. The melting point of
Pemoline is 256-257�C, and is soluble to an extent of 50 &micro;g/ml in water,
the figures for Pemoline Magnesium being >300�C and 70 &micro;g/ml respectively.
Pemoline is also practically insoluble in ether and acetone. Slightly
soluble in propylene glycol (1%) and in hot ethanol.</p>

<p>Pemoline is metabolized to an extent of 57% - the rest is excreted unchanged, primarily via the kidneys. Approximately 75% of an
oral dose is recovered in the urine within 24 hours. Metabolites include pemoline conjugates, pemoline dione and mandelic acid. In studies
conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration. However, this does not present proof for pemoline
being non-addictive, only that the safety is relatively high.</p>



<p>Pemoline Magnesium, originally thought to be a chelate between pemoline
and magnesium, displays certain pharmacological advantages over pemoline.
The compound is the monohydrate of a equimolar mixture between pemoline
and magnesium hydroxide. The absorption of pemoline magnesium is more
rapid and the duration of action is extended, and the effect is more
reliable<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>5,6</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

        <h4>Mandelic Acid Esterification</h4>

        <p>15.2 g (0.1 mole) DL-mandelic acid is dissolved in 250ml ethanol (at
          least 95%, but preferably absolute) containing 2ml conc. sulfuric acid.
          The mixture is held at reflux temperature for 3 hours and is then cooled
          to room temperature and allowed to stand overnight. 10g of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
          is added to neutralize the acid (some foaming may occur). The solution
          is filtered and the excess solvent is removed under vacuum. The residue
          is mixed with 50ml water and extracted with 3x50ml CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.
          The water phase is discarded and the combined extracts are mixed and
          powdered sodium sulfate is added to the solution until it is free of
          any turbidity. The solution is suction filtered and the solvent is removed
          under vacuum. The residue is an almost colorless liquid, weighing around
          12g (70%), pure enough for use in the next step. The ethyl mandelate
          can be further purified by vacuum distillation. The boiling point at
          atmospherical pressure is 253-255�C (103-105�C/2mmHg).</p>

<p>The preparation method for methyl mandelate is essentially the same. After removal of the solvent in the last step, methyl mandelate
spontaneously forms a slightly off-white crystalline mass, pure enough for use in the next step. Can be purified by recrystallization from
hot methanol, mp 54-56�C (bp 135�C at 12mmHg).</p>

        <p><strong>Esterification of Mandelic Acid Using an Iron(II)Sulfate Catalyst</strong><a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

        <p>Place a mixture of mandelic acid (10mmol), alcohol (20mL) and Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&middot;H<sub>2</sub>O
          (0.1g) in a 50mL two-necked flask , equipped with a condenser and mechanical
          stirrer. Reflux the mixture with stirring for 4 h, then remove the excess
          of alcohol by distillation under reduced pressure. Dilute the residue
          with ether (40mL) and filter off the catalyst. Wash the filtrate with
          5% sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated brine solution. Dry over
          anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filter and evaporate to give the crude
          product, which is distilled. The pure product is isolated by recrystallization
          from petroleum ether.</p>

<p>Methyl ester, mp 53-54�C, ethyl ester mp 35-36�C. Yields 83% of theory.</p>

<h4>Synthesis of Pemoline</h4>

        <p><strong>Using Sodium Metal as the Base:</strong> Slowly add 2.3 grams
          (0.1 mole) of sodium metal cut into small pieces to 50ml MeOH. Let the
          exothermic reaction subside and cool the beaker with ice/water. Add
          12.2 grams (0.1 mole) of guanidine nitrate, and let stir for 30mins.
          Add 0.1 mole mandelic ester (18 g ethyl mandelate or 16.6 grams methyl
          mandelate) dissolved in 50ml MeOH. Reflux the resulting solution until
          the evolution of NH<sub>3</sub> ceases (about 60 min). Let cool, and
          acidify to pH 2-4 with conc HCl. Filter off the precipitated crystals,
          and rinse with cold water and MeOH. Air dry to give the title compound
          as fine white crystals, mp 256-257�C.</p>

<p><strong>Using Sodium Hydroxide as the Base:</strong> A solution of guanidine freebase (Prepared by mixing a solution of 6.1g (0.05 mol) of Guanidine Nitrate in 30 ml of hot ethanol and a
solution of 2g (0.05 mol) NaOH in 25 ml hot ethanol). 4.5g (0.025 mol) of ethyl mandelate in 5ml of ethanol is added to this boiling mix,
and it is left at reflux for 30 minutes. The solution is cooled to room temperature, and 50 ml of cold distilled water is added. The
solution is filtered and the precipitate is washed with cold water and MeOH in small portions. The precipitated pemoline is air dried on
filter paper. Yield 90%, mp 256-257�C (dec).</p>

<p>The Guanidine can also be substituted with an equimolar amount of Cyanamide, giving a yield of roughly 80-90%<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>9,10</sup></a>.</p>

        <h4>Pemoline Magnesium<a href="pemoline.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a></h4>

        <p>To of Pemoline (4.4 g. 25 mmol) was added 50 ml of ethanol and 6 ml
          of 20 NaOH solution with rapid stirring. Following complete dissolution
          of the pemoline the solution was diluted with 100 ml distilled water.
          A solution of MgSO<sub>4</sub>&middot;7 H<sub>2</sub>O (6.2g, 25 mmol)
          in 20 ml water was slowly added over a period of 5 min., followed by
          5.5 ml of 20% NaOH solution to return the pH to 11. The resulting mixture
          was stirred for one hour, allowed to settle overnight, the clear aqueous
          solution decanted and the product obtained by filtration. The product
          was washed with water until the washings were neutral to litmus, then
          with a small quantity of acetone, followed by air drying.</p>
        <p>Yield 5.9 g or 90% of theoretical.</p>
