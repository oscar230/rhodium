<h2>A Simple Preparation of Tryptamine</h2>
<h4>Synthesis 475 (1972)</h4>
<p>by T. Kametani et al, HTML by Rhodium</p>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt">

  <p>Tryptamine was first synthesized by means of Fischer indole cyclization of 
    the phenylhydrazone of 4-aminobutyraldehyde<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. 
    Later, Majima and Hoshino<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>3</sup></a> prepared it by reduction 
    of indol-3-yl-acetonitrile which was derived from the reaction of indol-3-yl-magnesium 
    iodide with chloroacetonitrile. These methods have been superseded by the 
    preparative sequence involving gramine methiodide<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, 
    and by the synthesis via indol-3-yl-glyoxylamides<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>5,6</sup></a>. 
    Other methods are the lithium aluminum hydride reduction of either 3-(2-nitroethyl)-indole<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
    or 3-(2-nitrovinyl)-indole<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. A synthesis by 
    the reaction of indolylmagnesium bromide with ethylene imine was also reported<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>9</sup></a>. 
    However, these methods require expensive materials and numerous steps. Now 
    we wish to report an inexpensive one-step preparation of tryptamine from L-tryptophan 
    (<strong>1</strong>).</p>

<p>Thus, a suspension of L-tryptophan in forty times of weight of diphenylmethane was gently refluxed under a stream of nitrogen for 15--20 min, during which time evolution of carbon
dioxide was observed. After cooling, the clear yellow reaction mixture was treated with hydrogen chloride, and the resulting precipitate was collected and recrystallised to give tryptamine
hydrochloride in 60-63 % yield.</p>

  <p>Reduction of indol-3-yl-glyoxylamide<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>10,11</sup></a> (<strong>2</strong>) 
    with a mixture of aluminum chloride and lithium aluminum hydride (1:1) gave 
    tryptamine hydrochloride in ~70% yield.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Tryptamine Hydrochloride from L-Tryptophan (1):</h4>

    <p>A suspension of L-tryptophan (250 mg) in warm diphenylmethane (10 g) was gently 
      refluxed in a stream of nitrogen for 5-20 min until no more evolution of 
      carbon dioxide was observed. After cooling, the clear pale yellow reaction 
      mixture was treated with a benzene solution (20 ml) saturated with dry hydrogen 
      chloride. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed 
      with n-hexane and dried to afford crude tryptamine hydrochloride (223 mg, 
      93%) which was recrystallised from ethanol/ethyl acetate to yield tryptamine 
      hydrochloride (151 mg, 63%) as colorless needles, mp 248-249°C (Ref.<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, mp 
      246-248°C).</p>

<h4>Hydride Reduction of Indole-3-yl-glyoxylamide (2):</h4>

    <p>To a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (8 g) in tetrahydrofuran (200 
      ml) was added a solution of anhydrous aluminum chloride (28 g) in tetrahydrofuran 
      (300 ml) dropwise and with ice-cooling during 1.5 hr. To this hydride solution 
      was added dropwise a solution of indol-3-yl-glyoxylamide<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/refs"><sup>10,11</sup></a>(8 
      g) in tetrahydrofuran (400 ml) during 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture was then 
      stirred at 20-25° for 6 hr. An aqueous solution of 30°C sodium hydroxide 
      (400 ml) was added to the above mixture under ice-cooling, and the reaction 
      mixture was filtered off using celite. The filtrate was evaporated under 
      reduced pressure under a current of nitrogen to give a brown residue which 
      was extracted with a mixed solvent ethyl ether/methanol (95:5). Removal 
      of the solvent gave a solid which was dissolved in ethyl ether/methanol 
      (95:5). The resulting solution was then treated with dry hydrogen chloride 
      to form a precipitate. Filtration, followed by evaporation of the filtrate 
      to dryness, afforded tryptamine hydrochloride: yield: 1.5 g (70%). Recrystallization 
      from ethanol/ethyl acetate gave colorless needles, mp 246-248°C.</p>
