		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-4.jpg"></div>

		<p valign="top">Now get something to grasp onto the "lip" and break it off.</p>

	<tr>
    <td>
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-6.jpg"></div>
		<p valign="top">You should come up with 4 little pieces like these (2 silver, and 2 plastic rings)</p>
	</td>
    <td>
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-7.jpg"></div>
		<p valign="top">Being careful not to let any metal stay in contact (tools touching the silver parts or crimping some together), start taking sections of the casing and start pulling away. If the battery begins to heat up and you can't find where anything is in contact, throw it in your np so it won't ignite.</p>

	</tr>

	<tr>
    <td>
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-8.jpg"></div>
		<p valign="top">Take a pair of needle nose pliers and start rolling each section down like you were "peeling" a banana.</p>
	</td>
    <td>
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-9.jpg"></div>
		<p valign="top">Keep doing this until you are able to completely remove the casing. On the side at the bottom there will be a silver strip. Completely remove it by getting a good grip and pulling it out.<p valign="top"></td>

    <td colspan="2">
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-a.jpg"></div>
		<div class="pic right"><img src="pictures/battery-b.jpg"></div>
		<p valign="top">If you aren't going to use these right away, leave them like they are and store in some kind of NP solvent.</p>
		<h5 class="redtxt">Note by Rhodium:</h5>
        <p class="redtxt">You absolutely <strong>must</strong> use an inert hydrocarbon
          solvent for the storage of Lithium! Using the wrong solvent (especially
          halogenated and protic solvents) can and <strong>will</strong> lead
          to fires and possible explosions. Safe solvents include dry toluene,
          xylene, pentane/hexane/heptane, as well as <strong>pure</strong> petroleum
          ether or naphta (if you are unsure about the purity, use something else!).</p>
		<p valign="top">If you are ready for them, then find the end of the wrapping and start to unroll. It might be like a roll of tape getting started and try to strip into sections so be sure and get it to where it unrolls even. When you get it unrolled you will have a black layer, 2 white ones with a dull silver one in between them. This is your lithium and will start to heat up as it is exposed to air.</p>
		<p valign="top">Make sure you use them immediately or put them in some solvent cause they will catch on fire!</p>
