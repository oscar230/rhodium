<b>REINVESTIGATION OF THE GRIGNARD REACTIONS WITH FORMIC ACID.<br>
        A CONVENIENT METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF ALDEHYDES</b>

</p>

<b>Summary:</b> <em>Grignard reagents react with formic acid in
tetrahydrofuran to produce aldehydes in relatively good
yields. Various aldehydes such as alkyl, aryl, allyl, benzyl
and vinyl aldehydes were prepared from the corresponding
Grignard reagents. The reaction with vinyl Grignard reagents
proceeded with retention of configuration.</em>

</p>

<p>

Many methods have been reported for the preparation of aldehydes by
the reactions of Grignard reagents with masked formic acid or formal
derivatives<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#1_1">1</a></sup>. However, the reaction with formic
acid itself, which is obviously the most direct approach, was reported
to afford aldehydes only in very low yields<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#1_2">2</a>,<a href="grignard.formic.html#1_3">3</a></sup>, and, therefore, has not been used for
aldehyde synthesis.

</p>

<p>

Recently, a striking solvent effect of THF on Grignard reactions with
acid chlorides was observed. In marked contrast to the reaction in
ether, the reaction in THF gave ketones almost quantitatively. This
finding prompted us to reinvestigate the reaction of Grignard reagents
with formic acid in THF in expectation of production of aldehydes in
better yields than in ether.

</p>

<p>

In the preliminary investigation, the reaction of two moles of
hexylmagnesium bromide with a mole of formic acid in THF was carried
out, and a satisfactory yield (72%) of heptanal was obtained.
However, rather suprisingly, heptanal was found to be produced in a
55% yield even when ether was used as the solvent. The yield was
lower than for the reaction in THF but not so low as previously
reported<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#1_2">2</a>,<a href="grignard.formic.html#1_3">3</a></sup>. Though
the precise reason is not clear, we believe that insufficient drying
of formic acid was responsible for the low yield of aldehydes in the
previous investigations.

</p>

<p>

In view of the potential economy of this aldehyde synthesis in THF, we
decided to carry out the reaction which gives the magnesium salt of
formic acid by treatment with an equimolar amount of a readily
available Grignard reagent such as ethylmagnesium bromide, and then to
treat the magnesium salt with one mole of the desired Grignard reagent
as shown in eqs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.

</p>

<p>

<b>(1)</b>HCOOH + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> MgBr  ---&gt;  HCOOMgBr +
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>

</p>

<p>

<b>(2)</b>  HCOOMgBr + RMgBr  ---&gt;  HCR(OMgBr)<sub>2</sub>
---H<sub>2</sub>O --&gt;  RCHO

</p>

<p>

In a representative procedure, ethylmagnesium bromide in THF (0.84 M;
16 ml, 13.4 mmol) was added dropwise (20 min) to a solution of formic
acid (0.45 ml, 11.9 mmol) in dry THF (15 ml) while stirring under
argon at 0�.  Hexylmagnesium bromide (0.79 M; 10.5 ml, 8.3 mmol) was
then added (10 min) to this solution, and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was
decomposed with 2N HCl, extracted with ether, dried over
Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> , and then distilled under reduced
pressure (62�C, 35 Torr) to afford heptanal (0.72 g, 75% yield).

</p>

<p>

The presumed intermediate (1) seemed stable under the reaction
conditions and was converted to aldehyde only by hydrolysis, as the
<sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis of the reaction mixture in THF showed no peak due
to formyl protons before hydrolysis, whereas the peak appeared after the
addition of 2N HCl to the sample in the NMR tube.

</p>

<p>

As illustrated by the entries in Table 1, the method can be readily
extended to various Grignard reagents such as alkyl, aryl, benzyl,
allyl and vinyl Grignard reagents. The listed yields were obtained
using the above procedure without optimization for each substrate. It
can be seen that the yields were satisfactory in all cases except for
secondary aliphatic Grignard reagents. The reaction with vinylic
Grignard reagents followed by hydrolysis under neutral conditions (by
addition of H<sub>2</sub>O)<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#1_8">8</a></sup> afforded an
alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with the same stereoconfiguration as
the starting Grignard reagents, indicating that the reaction of
vinylic Grignard reagents with formic acid proceeds with retention of
configuration. Unfortunately, even if a Grignard reagent is prepared
from a pure (E) or (Z)-1-alkenyl halide, it becomes a mixture of (E)
and (Z)-1-alkenyl- magnesium halides<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#1_9">9</a>,<a href="grignard.formic.html#1_10">10</a>,<a href="grignard.formic.html#1_11">11</a></sup>.
Therefore, pure (E) and (Z)-2-alkenals could not be obtained directly.
However, as (Z)-2-alkenal is easily isomerized to the stable
(E)-isomer by acid, pure (E)-2-alkenal may be obtained easily by the
present method. Thus, pure (E)-cinnamaldehyde was prepared from the
Grignard reagent from either (E) or (Z)-beta-bromostyrene by
hydrolysis with 2N HCl after the reaction. Most   aldehyde syntheses
by the reactions of Grignard reagents with formic acid  derivatives in
the literatures need the acidic hydrolysis step. Therefore, it seems
difficult to prepare (Z)-2-alkenals by these methods. Therefore, it
is important to note that the present aldehyde synthesis makes it
possible to prepare (Z)-2-alkenals from (Z)-l-alkenylmagnesium halides
from either (E) or (Z)-beta-bromostyrene by hydrolysis with 2N HCl
after the reaction. Most aldehyde syntheses by the reactions of
Grignard reagents with formic acid derivatives in the literatures need
the acidic hydrolysis step. Therefore, it seems difficult to prepare
(Z)-2-alkenals by these methods. Therefore, it is important to note
that the present aldehyde synthesis makes it possible to prepare
(Z)-2-alkenals from (Z)-l-alkenylmagnesium halides.

<b>FORMYLATION OF ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS WITH LITHIUM (OR SODIUM)
FORMATE.
PART I. A FACILE SYNTHESIS OF ALDEHYDES FROM GRIGNARD REAGENT</b>

M. Bogavac, L. Arsenijevic, S. Pavlov and V. Arsenijevic
Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy
Belgrade, Yugoslavia

<b>Summary:</b> <em>Grignard reagent reacts with lithium (or sodium)
formate in boiling THF giving the corresponding aldehydes in
good yields. This reaction can be carried out at room
temperature as well, but stirring of the reaction mixture for
two or three days is required.</em>

<p>

Aldehydes can be obtained by the reaction of Grignard reagent with a
variety of compounds<a href="grignard.formic.html#2_1">1</a> and, recently, with several
N-formyl amines<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#2_2">2</a>-<a href="grignard.formic.html#2_4">4</a></sup>.
Some of this formamides give the aldehydes free of
secondary alcohol by-product. It has been also shown
that aldehydes can, be prepared in good yields by the
reaction of scrupulously anhydrous formic acid with
two moles of Grignard reagent, provided the reaction
is carried out in THF solution<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#2_5">5</a></sup>. The earlier
described synthesis of aldehydes from formic acid [or
copper(II) formate] and Grignard reagents, on account
of low yields, was of no preparative value<sup><a href="grignard.formic.html#2_6">6</a>,<a href="grignard.formic.html#2_7">7</a></sup>.

</p>

<p>

In this paper we have investigated the possibility of avoiding the use
of formic acid (the drying of this acid is a rather tedious process)
and have found that the formylation of Grignard reagent with lithium
or sodium formate is very convenient, one pot procedure, and gives
aldehydes without secondary alcohol as by-product ; also, in this
reaction only one mole of Grignard reagent is used and the transfer of
the reagent to the dropping funnel is unnecessary. These salts are
commercially available or may be easily prepared in the laboratory.

</p>

<p>

Alkaline salts of formic acid are very slightly soluble in THF, but on
heating, they react with Grignard reagent whereby the latter is added
to the formate carbonyl group. If the reaction is carried out in
ether, the yields are considerably lower, even after refluxing the
reaction mixture for three days. If a mixture of ether and THF (1:2)
is applied, the yields are approximately the same as those obtained in
THF, but a longer heating is required ; this is significant in cases
when it is more convenient to prepare Grignard reagent in ethereal
than in THF solution.

</p>

<p>

<b>Representative procedure:</b> to 0.192 mole of Grignard reagent
(prepared from 4.8 g of magnesium, 37.4 g of 2-bromoanisol and 200 ml
of THF), 11.5 g (0.22 mole) of lithium formate is added and the
reaction mixture is heated with boiling in a nitrogen atmosphere until
an almost clear solution is obtained (about 2 h), the major part of
THF is removed by distillation, 100 ml of ether and about 0.1 g of
hydroquinone are added to the residue, and the reaction mixture is
decomposed with dilute HCl (cooled to 0�.  2-Methoxybenzaldehyde is
isolated in usual way and distilled under nitrogen: bp 114�C/17 mmHg,
mp 36-7�C. The yield is 23 g (85%).

<b>Octanal:</b>

</p>

<p>

To a solution of 5.47g (119 mmol) of anhydrous formic acid in 150 ml
anhydrous THF under an atmosphere of nitrogen a solution of
ethylmagnesium bromide, prepared from 14.6 g (134 mmol) ethyl bromide
and 3.26g (134 mmol) magnesium turnings in 160 ml THF, is added during
the course of 2h with constant stirring at 0-2�.  At the same
temperature then a solution of n-heptylmagnesium bromide, prepared
from 14.9g (82.2 mmol) and 2.02g (83.2 mmol) magnesium turnings in 110
ml THF is added with stirring during the course of 1h. The solution
is stirred for another 2h at room temperature.

</p>

<p>

The batch is then hydrolysed by adding 100 ml of 2M HCl and extracted
by shaking with 400 ml Et<sub>2</sub>O <em>(in a sep funnel)</em>. The
organic phase is washed with saturated NaCl solution and then dried
over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solvent is removed under a
