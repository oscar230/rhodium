	  <p>Halogen exchange reactions between alkyl halides and metal salts
	  (Finkelstein reaction)[1,2,3] have found only limited synthetic applications
	  in the few examples where the equilibrium could be shifted in the desired
	  direction. In other cases, large excess of the metal halide are required making
	  the procedure uneconomical [4,5].</p>
	  <p>A new approach to the Finkelstein reaction was recently introduced
	  independently by several groups [6-9] who utilized phase transfer catalysts
	  to accelerate halogen exchange between metal salts in aqueous solutions and
	  alkyl halides in organic phase. It was shown that chloride, bromide, and
	  iodide as their sodium or potassium salts can be efficiently exchanged with
	  various alkyl chlorides or bromides. These reactions still suffer from the
	  disadvantage of being reversible, thus demanding large excess of the donor
	  halide salt (5 - 10 mol ratio) for obtaining significant yields of the alkyl
	  halide product. Alternatively, the aqueous salt of the metal salt was exchanged
	  several times with fresh solutions until the required conversion was obtained.</p>
	  <p> We have now observed that calcium bromide can serve as a very effective
	  brominating agent for primary alkyl halides in the presence of lipophilic
	  quanternary as phase transfer catalysts according to the following general
	  scheme.</p>
	  <center><b>2 R-Cl (org) + CaBr<sub>2</sub> ----> 2 R-Br (org) + CaCl<sub>2</sub></b></center>
	  <p>The reactions were typically carried out at 110<sup>o</sup>C in the
	  presence of 2 mol% of tetrahexylammonium bromide and in the absence of any
	  additional solvent (Table). Quanternary ammonium or phosphonium salts with
	  less than 25 carbon atoms proved to be non-effective in the catalysis.</p>

<b>[b]</b> The conversions were determined by G.L.C (conditions: 20% Carbowax 20 M

<p>Surprisingly, it was found that the exchange reaction of calcium bromide with
primary alkyl bromides is practically non-reversible, provided that the amount of
water in the system is limited to 5% w/w of the calcium bromide. Under such conditions,
no molar excess of the bromide salt is necessary to achieve 90-95% conversions.
When larger amounts of water were present in the system, the conversions were lower.
This phenomenon was found to be unique to calcium bromide as a brominating agent
and was not observed with sodium and potassium bromides, where the quantity of
water in the system had only a minor effect on the conversions. Highly concentrated
(95% w/w) solutions of sodium bromide and potassium bromide yielded only 78 and
34% conversions, respectively, when reacted with stoichiometric quantities of
<i>n</i>-octyl chloride.</p>
<p>The unique behavior of calcium bromide in these systems is attributed to the
very high ratio of activity coefficients of calcium bromide to calcium chloride
in highly concentrated aqueous solutions and to the fact that calcium chloride is
precipitated from concentrated solutions of calcium bromide. The physical properties
of these systems will be published separately. </p>
<h3>1-Bromooctane; Typical Procedure;</h3>
<p>In a 100 ml round bottomed flask, 1-chlorooctane (14.87 g, 0.1 mol), 95%
calcium bromide (10.53 g, 0.05 mol) and tetrahexylammonium bromide (0.8692 g 0.002 mol)
The mixture is stirred with a mechanical stirrer for 24 h at 110°C. After this time,
G.L.C. analysis (20% Carbowax 20 M on Chromosorb W) shows a 92.8% conversion to
1-bromooctane. The mixture is diluted with dichloromethane (25 ml), the organic layer
is separated, washed with water (2 x 25 ml), dried with sodium sulfate, and distilled
to give 1-bromooctane of purity 99%; yield: 17.2 g (89%); n<sub>d</sub><sup>20</sup>
: 1.4518 (Ref.<sup>10</sup> n<sub>d</sub><sup>20</sup>: 1.4524
