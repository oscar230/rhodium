<h2>High-yielding synthesis of MDA from MDP2P<br>via Formation of the Oxime Followed by Reduction</h2>

<div class="stdtxt">

<p>This route to MDA isn't anything new. In fact it has been around since 1955. The general overview of the reaction is; <strong>1</strong>) Formation of the oxime and <strong>2</strong>)
reduction of the oxime to the amine. The fist step is easily accomplished by reacting the parent ketone with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Old geezer
Shulgin did this with pyridine<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> in a 51% yield. But it can be done with considerably better yields employing plain sodium acetate and methanol<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1. Formation of the oxime.</strong></p>

<p>5.4g sodium acetate trihydrate and 4ml water was combined in a 50ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was heated gently with stirring until the
acetate was in solution. 20 ml MeOH was added followed with 4.5g MDP2P. To this there was added 2.3g hydroxylamine hydrochloride and the mixture was
refluxed with stirring for 1.5h. After this period 10ml water was added and the heating source was removed and the mixture was allowed to cool in a
waterbath with the stirring continued. After returning to room temp the flask was put in the freezer for an hour or so. The white crystalline material
was filtered and washed with 50ml water (the filtrate may turn  cloudy as small amounts of product crystallizes). The product was dried over magnesium
perchlorate to constant weight. </p>
<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 4.5g (92%), mp 84-85�C. Lit: 84-87�C (H<sub>2</sub>O-EtOH)</p>
<p>The oxime can also be made in equally good yields with sodium carbonate as the base in 60% EtOH<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The reduction is done with sodium metal in EtOH<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>2,4</sup></a>:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2. Reduction of the oxime.</strong></p>

<p>3.86g (0.02 mole) oxime was dissolved in 50 ml dry ethanol (fresh 99.5% is OK, otherwise look in Vogel for a procedure for making anhydrous EtOH with
Mg and I<sub>2</sub>) in a two-necked 250ml roundbottomed flask equipped with a condenser, a cork and a stirring magnet. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux,
the heat was turned off and 5g elemental sodium was added in such rate that a steady reflux was maintained (make 20-30 pieces and store under hexane).
The first additions is conviently kept small. <em>(Note: Hydrogen evolution!)</em>. At the end the reaction was slower so the heating mantle was turned back on to
speed things up. The waterwhite, clear postrxn mixture was then slowly treated with 16g H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in 200ml cold water. The EtOH was removed under vacuum,
and the resulting water phase was washed twice with DCM. The aq. phase was made basic by addition of 25% NaOH. The freebase was extracted with 3x30ml DCM.
The pooled organic extracts was evaporated under vacuum to constant weight leaving a pale colored residue (3.36g, 94%).</p>

<p>The freebase was dissolved in 20ml IPA, neutralized with 1.6ml HCl and percipitated by the addition of 40 ml Et<sub>2</sub>O. The crystals was filtered and washed
with a small amount of Et<sub>2</sub>O. </p>
<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 3.4g of white MDA-HCl, mp 187.5-188.5�C. (Lit: 187-188�C)</p>
</div>
<p>This reduction can also be done in n-BuOH<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>  and with quite a few NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction systems (NiCl<sub>2</sub><a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, TiCl<sub>4</sub><a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, MoO<sub>3</sub><a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>, Co-PC<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>,
Amberlyst-15/LiCl<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>, and even with plain NaBH<sub>4</sub> in EtOH<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>). Adding NaOH to a suspension of Ni-Al is also said to reduce oximes<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> as is
SnCl<sub>2</sub>-Sn-HCl<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Different  synthesis of oximes starting with nitroalkenes should be looked into, as this could be a good alternative to the existing methods for reducing
nitroalkenes. SnCl<sub>2</sub>  reduces nitroalkenes to oximes under both acidic and basic conditions<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>14,15,16</sup></a>. Zn(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in 1,2-DiMeO-ethane does reduce
3,4-MD-phenyl-2-nitropropene to the oxime in good yields<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>. Another promising route is the use of Pb in DMF<a href="mdaoxime.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>. This seems to reduce most nitroalkenes
to the corresponding oximes.</p>
