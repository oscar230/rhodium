<b>Steam volatility of methamphetamine, amphetamine and
ephedrine</b><br>


<p>

This article was dug up for you by lugh. (thanks!)
   It compares the steam volatility of pervitine,
benzedrine and ephedrine. this might be very interesting for
those steaming their reaction mixture.  I read
the key sentence for the ADD/ADHDers amongst us ;) but this
might also be of interesting for those trying to steam
ephedrine out of plant material. check it out...

<center><b>On the steam volatility of Pervitine, Benzedrine and Ephedrine</b></center><br>
<center>by R.  H�NEMOHR and.    SCHEIBE (1)</center>

</p>

<p>

For the isolation of amphetamines and related compounds, as
well in small as in big scale, besides extraction, steam
distillation from basic solution is used since long, because
those compounds are usually volatile with steam.
Also in recent time, this method of isolation of
amphetamines from biological material, resp. purification of
obtained reaction mixtures, was recommended for example by
Griebel, Vidic and Scheibe.  D.
Richter on the other hand believes to be able to isolate
amphetamines without steam distillation, whereas
Mc.  Nally emphatically recommends the use
thereof.

</p>

<p>

With this method it is possible to separate amphetamines
from alkaloids and biogenic amines (especially decomposition
products of proteins), as long as those are not
volatile.  However according to our experiences,
presence of adrenaline derivates in the biological material
can make troubles during the detection of amphetamines in
the steam distillate.  According to Vidic these
troubles can be circumvented by using his method of
detection with platinum chloride reagent.  He
explicitly mentioned that using his method, no interferences
by adrenaline derivates or biogenic amines are to be
expected.

</p>

<p>

Because of these unclarities, it seemed advisable to verify
the steam volatility of pervitine, benzedrine and similar
compounds in a number of experiments.  To achieve
this goal, it was necessary to characterise the behaviour of
the amphetamines benzedrine and pervitine in steam
distillation.  At the same time it should be
clarified if a quantitative isolation of those amphetamines
from aqueous medium is possible.  As comparison
substance only ephedrine was used.

</p>

<p>

According to the available literature (Graf), the
amphetamine bases should be separable from the ephedrine
base.  But unpublished experiments (Scheibe)
showed that a certain amount of this base is found in the
distillate, when steam distilling from basic
solution.  That's why pervitine hydrochloride,
benzedrine sulfate and ephedrine hydrochloride were steam
distilled from basic solution and the distillate collected
in sulfuric acid in multiple fractions.  Thus it
was possible to get an idea of the course of the steam
distillation.  We will describe the details of
this method below.

</p>

<p>

The preparation of the solutions was the same for all the
compounds, namely pervitine hydrochloride, benzedrine
sulfate and ephedrine hydrochloride.  All
solutions were made up with distilled water, the measurement
thereof was performed in officially calibrated graduated
flasks, resp. pippetes.  All glassware was
thoroughly washed and degreased.

</p>

<p>

The substance to be analysed was dried for 24h in an
evacuated dissicator.  Then exactly 25 mg were
weighed on a microscale, dissolved in a little water,
transfered into a 100 ml graduated flask and the flask
filled up exactly to the 100 ml mark.  Series of
different concentrations were then prepared from this stock
solution containing in each case 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200,
250, 300 and 400 ug substance in 2 ml.  The
individual solutions and the stock solution were kept at
+4�C in the fridge if they couldn't be used right
away.  However it is not advisable to use the
solutions for more than 10 days, because after this time the
concentration on substance starts to decline drastically.

</p>

<p>

2 ml of an exactly adjusted solution were then made basic in
a separatory funnel with 2 drops 30% sodium hydroxide
solution and extracted two times with 2 ml pure
chloroform.  The extracts were transferred into a
little measuring flask with a 5 ml mark.  Then
the solution was extracted a third time with 2 ml
chloroform, but only so much of the chloroform was
transferred into the measuring flask so that the volume of
the extract was exactly 5 ml.  The contents of
the measuring flask were filtered through filterpaper
(moistened with chloroform) into a test tube and treated
with 3 drops 2% picric acid in chloroform.
Pervitine- (Benzedrine-, Ephedrine-) picrate was thus
obtained, giving the solution a more or less intense yellow
colour, depending on the concentration.

</p>

<p>

The extinction of those solutions was measured with a
Pulfrich-photometer using 1 cm layer thickness against pure
chloroform with a S42 filter.  The extinctions,
each determined by 6 readings, were plotted against a
coordinate system, using the usual method.  In
order to determine the blank value, 2 ml aqua dest were
recorded.  The thus obtained extinction
coefficient was never higher than 0.03 (0.02 - 0.04).

</p>

<p>

The calibration curves were linear for all substances below
an absolute amount of 300 ug of pure substance, whereas at
higher amounts, the increase of the extinction was not
proportional to the increase of concentration anymore (see
curves).  The effect of time on the extinction
(after addition of picric acid) was also determined by
repeated measurement.  Here it appeared (as
opposing to statements by D.  Richter) that about
5 minutes after the addition of picric acid the extinction
does not change for the next 24 h.

</p>

</p>

<p>

The steam distillation was performed using the common
Parnas-Wagner (Schott & Gen., Jena) apparatus for
nitrogen determination.  2 ml of the to be
analysed solution and then 2 ml 30% sodium hydroxide were
introduced into the distillation flask.  Three
times about 2 ml water were used to wash the last bit of
substance into the flask.  For every solution
five graduated separatory funnels where filled with 10 ml 4N
sulfuric acid; for ephedrine up to 15 separatory funnels
were necessary per sample.  The steam flask was
heated with a triple bunsen burner.  The lower
end of the condenser was slightly immersed into the sulfuric
acid in the separatory funnel.  The distillation
was executed until 10 ml of distillate were collected, then
the receiver was quickly changed until no more base could be
detected.  When changing the receiver care was
taken not to lose a single drop.  The content of
every separatory funnel was then treated with 30% sodium
hydroxide until clearly basic.  Then the solution
was extracted, filtered and measured like described above.

</p>

<p>

When steam distilling between 5 and 500 ug pervitine, the
bulk of the base could already be found in the first
fraction.  In the case of ephedrine on the other
hand, the base came considerably slower.  The
steam distillation had to be extremely forced in this
case.  The bulk of the base (especially when
using bigger amounts) was nearly evenly distributed in the
first 10 fractions.  Even when using solutions of
low concentration, the base could be detected more or less
noticeably in the 6th up to the 10th fraction.
The amount of base in the first 5 fractions was considerably
lower than in the case of pervitine or
benzedrine.  Benzedrine seems to behave like
pervitine in steam distillations, but the former seems to be
more volatile with steam (see pic.  2).

amines in the different fractions of the steam distillation.
- The lowest section gives the amount in the first fraction,
the second from bottom the amount in the second fraction and
so on.

</p>

<p>

1 = 100 ug Pervitine HCl<br>
2 = 500 ug Pervitine HCl<br>
3 = 100 ug Benzedrine sulfate<br>
4 = 500 ug Benzedrine sulfate<br>
5 = 100 ug Ephedrine HCl<br>
5 = 500 ug Ephedrine HCl

</p>

<p>

On the basis of the performed experiments, one notes that
pervitine and benzedrine are very volatile with steam and
are to be expected in the first fractions.  This
is in accordance with relevant publications.
Amphetamines can easily be separated from less volatile
bases by steam distillation.

</p>

<p>

If it was to be desired that already the first fraction
contains an as big as possible amount of ephedrine, then the
used steam had to be very powerful and the distillation had
to be assisted by direct heating of the distillation
flask.  While the qualitative detection of
ephedrine gave only a very weak positive result when slowly
distilling, using a strong stream gave considerably more
base.  Even though not always 100% of the bases
could be recovered in the experiments, no bases could be
detected in the distillation flask.  This can
possibly be attributed to the destruction of the amines
after longer heating in strongly alkaline solution - see for
example Griebel (manual entry)! -

</p>

<p>

Strangely, Vidic found with his microbeaker experiments that
the main part of the pervitine base was to be found in the
<b>second</b> fraction (in the second
condensation).  Our experiments clearly show that
Vidic's results are only valid for the microbeaker method
(this is also true for the Griebel method) and must not be
generalised.

</p>

<p>

<font color="red">A separation of ephedrine from the
amphetamines seems possible if a steam distillation <b>as
mild as possible</b> is used to isolate the
amphetamines.</font color="red">   Then a forced
steam distillation can be used to separately collect the
ephedrine.

</p>

<p>

For the analysis of biological material, it rests to find
out if the steam distillation is better done before or after
the extraction of the main groups of pharmaceuticals
etc.  As is generally known, distillation from
alkaline medium sets free an abundance of biogenic amines
through basic reaction, which can appear in the distillate
and interfere with the analysis of the
amphetamines.  Of course the results of the
measurements are the more doubtable, the more of those
interfering substances etc. are in the
distillate.  Especially with thoroughly dried
ether and chloroform extracts this seems not to be that much
of a problem as with untreated material, so it seem
purposeful to perform the steam distillation only after
extraction with organic solvents.

</p>

<p>

<b>Summary</b>

</p>

<p>In order to obtain exact fundamentals for the isolation of amphetamines, the steam volatility thereof was examined. The following results were obtained:</p>

<p>

1.  Pervitine and benzedrine are fairly volatile.<br>
2.  They can be isolated nearly quantitatively from aqueous alkaline solution by steam distillation.<br>
3.  An separation from ephedrine can only be achieved by steam distillation when special experimental conditions (slow distillation) are adhered to.<br>
