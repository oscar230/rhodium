<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Three syntheses of the natural synergist dillapiol from the natural, commercially available sesamol as
starting material, are described. A major difference between these is the order of introduction of the
additional methoxy and allyl substituents. In one of the syntheses, a formyl group is introduced at C4 via an
electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction and then converted into the methoxy group using a Baeyer-Villiger
reaction and subsequent methylation; in the other two, a directed ortho-metalation, Baeyer-Villiger,
methylation sequence was employed. Various intermediates along the synthetic route were used to generate more
than 30 analogs, including the 4-thiomethyldillapiol, to investigate the structure activity relationships of
the pesticide synergism of these compounds.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/dillanalogs.sch0.gif">
</div>

<p>During the past few years we have been involved in a project aimed at developing natural insecticides<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Part of this includes the use of the naturally occurring synergist dillapiol (<strong>1</strong>). Dillapiol is a member of a
group of both natural and synthetic synergists known as polysubstrate mono-oxygenase inhibitors (PMSO) whose
key structural unit is a benzene ring bearing a methylenedioxy unit<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. Examples of natural lignans with known
synergistic activity, in addition to the dillapiol, are myristicin (<strong>2</strong>) and safrole (<strong>3</strong>).</p>

<p>Dillapiol is a monolignan and a major constituent of the essential oils of a number of plants, including
Indian dill (<em>Antheum graveolus</em>)<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> [sic], and <em>Piper aduncum</em><a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, a species in the Piperaceae family. The latter
grows as a small shrub in many tropical areas such as Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia.
The development of dillapiol for commercial purposes requires either an inexpensive reliable natural source or
a viable synthetic source. Additionally for registration purposes both the toxicity to nontarget species and
pharmacokinetics including the nature of the metabolites need to be known. The latter studies can be carried
out best with isotopically labeled material.</p>

<p>Three syntheses of dillapiol have previously been reported. 3,4,5-Trimethoxyacetophenone<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, 2-hydroxy-3-
methoxybenzaldehyde (o-vanillin)<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, and 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> were used as starting materials. These
syntheses required 5-7 steps and occurred in 2, 10, and 6% yield, respectively.</p>

<h3>Discussion of results</h3>

<div class="pic right">
<p><strong>Scheme 1</strong></p>
<img src="pictures/dillanalogs.sch1.gif">
<p class="style1"><em>Reagents:</em> <strong>(a)</strong> K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>2</sub>Br; <strong>(b)</strong> N,N-dimethylaniline (180�C); 
<br><strong>(c)</strong> (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>-SnCl<sub>4</sub>-Bu<sub>3</sub>N; <strong>(d)</strong> CH<sub>3</sub>I-K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>;<strong> (e)</strong> MCPBA-CHCl<sub>3</sub> (18 h, 0�C); 
<br><strong>(f)</strong> LiOH-THF-H<sub>2</sub>O; <strong>(g)</strong> CH<sub>3</sub>I-K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-acetone.</p>
</div>

<p>Three syntheses have been completed starting with sesamol (<strong>6</strong>). These are shown in <strong>Schemes 1-3</strong>. In the first
synthesis, <strong>Scheme 1</strong>, sesamol (<strong>6</strong>)<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#notes"><sup>*</sup></a> was converted to the ortho-allylated phenol <strong>7</strong> in 81% overall yield via
O-allylation, followed by a Claisen rearrangement. Introduction of the formyl group into the 4 position in 7 was
accomplished by treatment with formaldehyde, SnCl<sub>4</sub>, and tributylamine<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> to afford <strong>8</strong> in 60% isolated yield.
Replacement of tributylamine by other tertiary amines such as triethyl- or trioctylamine either reduces or did
not improve the yield of <strong>8</strong>. The variation of other reaction parameters such as temperature and reaction time
also did not result in yield improvements.</p>

<p>This compound was quantitatively methylated to <strong>9</strong> in preparation for the Baeyer-Villiger and subsequent
hydrolysis of the formate ester to form <strong>10</strong>. The conversion of <strong>9</strong> to <strong>10</strong> was carried out using 1 equiv. of MCPBA
in CHCl<sub>3</sub> at 0�C for 18 h and afforded the formyl intermediate in 71% isolated yield, saponification of which
gave 10. Under these conditions competition by the alkene moiety for the peracid to give an epoxide was minor;
at room temperature the rates of desired Baeyer-Villiger and the epoxidation were quite comparable. Finally,
methylation of 10 with CH<sub>3</sub>I-K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in acetone afforded pure dillapiol.</p>

<p>The overall yield of dillapiol from sesamol via <strong>Scheme 1</strong>, based on the isolated yields of each intermediate,
is more than 21%. The major shortcomings of this route are the rather stringent conditions required for the
introduction of the formyl group and the problem of the competing epoxidation of the terminal double bond
during the Baeyer-Villiger reaction of <strong>9</strong>. These difficulties became more severe on attempted scale-up.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<p><strong>Scheme 2</strong></p>
<img src="pictures/dillanalogs.sch2.gif">
<p class="style1"><em>Reagents:</em> <strong>(a)</strong> MOM-Cl, <em>n-</em>BuLi; <strong>(b)</strong> <em>n</em>-BuLi, THF, (-78�C), then DMF; <strong>(c)</strong> MCPBA; 
<br><strong>(d)</strong> 10% KOH; <strong>(e)</strong> K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>I; <strong>(f)</strong> CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, NaI; <strong>(g)</strong> K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 
<br>CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>2</sub>Br; <strong>(h)</strong> N,N-dimethylaniline (180�C); <strong>(i)</strong> K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>I</p>
</div>

<p>Considerable effort was expended to avoid the sensitive reactions and shorten the synthesis by going directly
from <strong>7</strong> to the resorcinol <strong>20</strong> and hence to dillapiol. Direct o-hydroxylation of <strong>7</strong> using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-AlCl<sub>3</sub> according to
Kurz and Johnson<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> or by use of oxygen and copper metal in the presence of CuCl<sub>2</sub> as developed by Capdevielle
and Maumy<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> was unsuccessful and gave mainly recovered <strong>7</strong>. In the second synthesis, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>, the
MOM-protected sesamol <strong>11</strong> was o-metallated<a href="dillapiole.analogs.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> and treated with DMF to produce the aldehyde <strong>12</strong> in 85% yield. The
protection of phenol as a THP derivative, thus avoiding the rather expensive MOM-chloride, was not possible
since reaction of <strong>6</strong> with dihydropyran in the presence of acid resulted in the introduction of the THP unit at
C6 via an electrophile aromatic substitution to afford <strong>16</strong> rather than the desired phenol protection.</p>

<p>Baeyer-Villiger oxidation followed by basic hydrolysis afforded phenol <strong>13</strong> which was methylated to give <strong>14</strong>.
Removal of the MOM group set the stage for alkylation and subsequent Claisen rearrangement to afford phenol
  <strong>15</strong>, methylation of which gave dillapiol <strong>1</strong>. The overall yield of dillapiol via <strong>Scheme 2</strong> was 19%. After this
synthesis was completed we realized that one might be able to avoid the protection-deprotection sequence if
ortho-directed metallation and subsequent introduction of the formyl group could be carried out on the allyl
ether <strong>17</strong> to give <strong>18</strong>. The conversion of <strong>18</strong> to dillapiol would require first a Baeyer-Villiger reaction and
hydrolysis to the resorcinol <strong>19</strong> and then double methylation to dillapiol. Such a sequence would save three
steps from the synthesis shown in <strong>Scheme 2</strong>.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<p><strong>Scheme 3</strong></p>
<img src="pictures/dillanalogs.sch3.gif">
<p class="style1"><em>Reagents</em>: <strong>(a)</strong> nBuLi, THF, (-78�C), then DMF; 
<br><strong>(b)</strong> MCPBA (25�C), then KOH; <strong>(c)</strong> N,N-dimethylaniline 
<br>(180�C); <strong>(d)</strong> CH3I, K2CO3, acetone.</p>
</div>

<p>We were concerned that <strong>17</strong> would undergo a 1,2-Wittig rearrangement rather than the directed <em>ortho</em>-metallation.
Fortunately, this fear was unfounded and reaction of <strong>17</strong> with 1 equiv. of <em>n</em>-BuLi followed addition of DMF gave
<strong>18</strong> in 87% isolated yield. Conversion to <strong>19</strong> was successful upon stirring with MCPBA at 0�C for 24 h. The
reduced nucleophilicity of the double bond in <strong>18</strong> relative to <strong>9</strong> allows the Baeyer-Villiger reaction to proceed
without competition from the epoxidation of the allyl ether. The intermediate formate ester was hydrolyzed to
<strong>19</strong> without purification. Claisen rearrangement of <strong>19</strong> at 190�C afforded the resorcinol <strong>20</strong> which was methylated
to dillapiol. The overall yield of dillapiol from sesamol via <strong>Scheme 3</strong> is 31%.</p>

<h3>Synthesis of dillapiol analogues</h3>

<p>Several of the intermediates in <strong>Schemes 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> were suitable for the preparation of dillapiol analogues. For
example, ortho-metallation of the MOM-protected sesamol <strong>11</strong>, followed by treatment with dimethyl disulfide
afforded the S-methyl derivative <strong>21</strong> in 91% yield. This compound was converted via <strong>22a</strong> into the 3-thiomethyl
analog of dillapiol <strong>23a</strong> in four steps in 48% overall yield.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<p><strong>Scheme 4</strong></p>
<img src="pictures/dillanalogs.sch4.gif">
<p class="style1"><em>Reagents:</em> <strong>(a)</strong> <em>n</em>-BuLi, THF, (-78�C), then RSSR; <strong>(b)</strong> HCl-MeOH-NaI; 
<br><strong>(c)</strong> allyl bromide - K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - acetone; <strong>(d)</strong> N,N-dimethylaniline (180�C); 
<br><strong>(e)</strong> CH<sub>3</sub>I-K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-acetone</p>
</div>

<p>Surprisingly, reaction of the ortho-lithiated allyl ether with dimethyl disulfide was not nearly as efficient
as reaction with DMF and afforded only about 55% of the desired product. In addition, a significant amount of
a by-product which was difficult to separate from the desired product was obtained. The by-product has not
been identified and this route to sulfur analogues of dillapiol was not pursued further.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p><strong>General comments</strong></p>

<p>Solvents used in reactions were distilled prior to use. <em>n</em>-BuLi was purchased from Aldrich as a hexane solution and titrated [<em>diphenylacetic acid</em>] prior to use. Usual work-up refers to partitioning of the reaction mixture between an organic solvent such as ether, ethyl acetate, or dichloromethane and water or 5% NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution, drying of the organic phase with anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and evaporating the solvents at reduced pressure. Yields, unless indicated otherwise, refer to chromatographically pure fractions.</p>

<p>From 4.0 g of <strong>21a</strong> and 3.94 g of NaI in 15 mL of acetone and 40 mL of 3 N methanolic HCl was obtained 2.65 g (80%) of the title compound as a white powder, mp 51-53�C.</p>

<p><strong>Allylation of the 4-thio-5-hydroxy derivatives, General procedure</strong></p>

<p>The above phenols were dissolved in acetone containing about 10-20% excess of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The mixture was refluxed for up to 24 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was partitioned between ether and 10% NaOH solution. Further processing of the ether phase gave the desired product.</p>

<p><strong>5-Allyoxy-4-methylthio-1,3-benzodioxole</strong></p>

<p>From 1.89 g of 5-hydroxy derivative, series a, 2.13 g of potassium carbonate and 0.90 mL of allyl bromide in 15 mL acetone was obtained after 23 h of reflux, 2.03 g (88%) of the desired product as a clear liquid.</p>

<p><strong>Claisen rearrangement of the 5-allyl ethers General procedure</strong></p>

<p>The 5-allyl ethers obtained as described above were dissolved in a small quantity of N,N-dimethylaniline and heated to 190�C for 1-3 h. The cooled reaction mixture was diluted with ether and extracted with 10% NaOH solution. The combined basic extracts were acidified and extracted with ether. Further work-up and purification yielded the desired Claisen rearrangement products.</p>

<p><strong>5-Hydroxy-4-methylthio-6-(2-propenyl)-1,3-benzodioxole (22a)</strong></p>

<p>Allyl ether, series a (1.0 g, 4.0 mmol) when heated in 5 mL of N,N-dimethylaniline (5 mL) at 190�C for 2.5 h, gave 0.87 g (87%) of 22a as a colourless liquid.</p>

<p><strong>5-Methoxy-4-methylthio-6-(2-propenyl)-1,3-benzodioxole (23a)</strong></p>

<p>Phenol <strong>22a</strong> (400 mg, 1.8 mmol), was converted in 87% yield (372 mg) to <strong>23a</strong> in the same manner as the conversion <strong>8</strong> to <strong>9</strong>.</p>
