        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>First of all many thanks go to CHEM_GUY for his continuous urging of
          the Hive community to try Urushibara Nickel reduction on phenylnitropene.
          This reduction turned out to be easier than any so far encountered.
          This is not based on any of the excellent references pertaining to Urushibara
          that have been mentioned on the hive, only chem_guys postings! </p>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>

        <p>Dissolve 4.0g Nickel Chloride hydrate (light green crystals) in 75
          ml 95% ethanol w/ mag stirring and warming to 50�C. After salt is dissolved
          remove stir bar and add 1ml water and 1ml conc. HCl.<a href="amph.urushibara.html#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> While solution
          at 50�C slowly add 5g regular Reynolds wrap torn up into 0.25 x 1.0in
          strips in 1g portions with manual stirring. The aluminum will SLOWLY
          react with the nickel salt forming the metal Ni<sub>(s)</sub> through metathesis
          as a dark grey chunky powder which settles to the bottom. A gentle effervescence
          of hydrogen occurs during reaction. Add aluminum at a rate that maintains
          a steady effervescence and keeps temperature roughly in the 50�C range.
          Note this may take up to two hours! At the end of Al addition all green
          color from nickel salt should be discharged. If any color remains add
          another gram of aluminum and wait for soln to clear. Precipitated Nickel
          powder was added to 100ml 20% NaOH soln and manually stirred at 60�C
          for 30 min. Excess NaOH is decanted and nickel is washed with 5 x100ml
          aliquots of distilled water to remove excess base. At this point Urishubara
          nickel catalyst is prepared and ready for reduction.</p>

	 <p>Dissolve 5g pure
          phenylnitropropene in 50ml Ethanol and add to Ni solution.<a href="amph.urushibara.html#notes"><sup>2</sup></a> Now slowly
          add 3ml conc. HCl<a href="amph.urushibara.html#notes"><sup>3</sup></a> and 1 gram shredded aluminum w/ manual stirring.
          Aluminum will slowly dissolve with a more vigorous effervescence of
          hydrogen than the first step. Maintaining good stirring with a glass
          stirring rod is essential in beginning. Attempted magnetic stirring
          will result in frustration because nickel is ferromagnetic and will
          stick to stirbar preventing surface area exposure necessary for reduction.
          After aluminum is dissolved add three more milliliters HCl and one more
          gram Al. Repeat adding acid and Al until 10 grams Al and about 30ml
          HCl has been added. Aluminum reacts slowly. Expect addition to take
          about six hours, longer if temp falls below 50�C. Constant stirring towards
          end is not necessary, just give mix a good stir occasionally.</p>

	 <p>After all aluminum is added and mostly decomposed slowly pour in a soln of
          30g NaOH in 100ml H<sub>2</sub>O with careful stirring. Wear goggles and be careful!
          Base neutralization is highly exothermic! In 30 minutes all aluminum
          sludge will solvate into bottom aqueous layer and a nice orange alcohol
          layer reeking of amine will settle out on top. Nickel is not dissolved
          by the NaOH so it will remain floating around between the two layers
          but this does not present a major problem. After all, it�s not poisonous
          like mercury or anything! Now decant off the top orange organic layer
          and distill off alcohol down to a orange stinky syrup completely different
          smelling than the P2NP. Dissolve these goodies in acetone and slowly
          add sulfuric acid to precipitate the amine sulfate. <i><b>Voila!!!!!!</b></i>
          about 3 grams light yellow amphetamine sulfate.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
		<a name="notes"></a>

	<ol>
	<li><span class="oli">Addition of water and acid found to be necessary to initiate rxn between NiCl<sub>2</sub> and Al.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">When nitropropene was added to NiCl<sub>2</sub> soln before conversion to Ni powder was complete some polymerization occurred greatly reducing yield. It seems essential to add P2NP to rxn after Ni is fully precipitated.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Use of Sulfuric acid produced inferior results causing polymerization of P2NP to red tar.</span></li> 
	</ol>
        <p><strong>Increasing Yield:</strong> Use overhead mechanical stirring to keep nickel catalyst better suspended during reduction. Re-extract aqueous NaOH/Al layer
          w/ toluene and work up in standard manner. Use larger amount of nickel catalyst and more aluminum for H<sub>2</sub> generation.</p>
