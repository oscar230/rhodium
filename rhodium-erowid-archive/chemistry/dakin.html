This bee found a rather interesting reference today when reading a new
chem book on reaction mechanisms. It involves the so-called
<em>Dakin</em> reaction.

<b>Title:</b> Sodium Percarbonate: A Convenient Reagent for the Dakin Reaction<br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Sodium percarbonate, a readily available, inexpensive and
easy to handle reagent efficiently oxidizes hydroxylated benzaldehydes
and hydroxylated acetophenones to hydroxyphenols.

</p>

<p>

Phenols and their derivatives are fundamentally important substrates
used extensively in organic synthesis. In the Dakin reaction,
hydroxylated benzaldehydes are converted to hydroxy-phenols through
the replacement of formyl groups by a hydroxyl moiety using alkaline
hydrogen peroxide (1). Other reagents have been employed to oxidize
aromatic aldehydes to arylformates; these include peroxyacetic acid
(2), peroxybenzoic acid (3), m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (4) and
organoperoxyselenic acid (5).

</p>

<p>

Sodium percarbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.1,5H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a very inexpensive large scale
industrial chemical which is extensively used in the detergent
industry as a bleaching agent (6). It has been used for the oxidation
of sulfides (7), amines (7,8), organoboranes (9) as well as for the
epoxidation of olefins (7) and hydrolysis of nitriles to amides (10).
We now wish to report that sodium percarbonate oxidizes hydroxylated
benzaldehydes and acetophenones to hydroxy phenols in good yields
(Table).

</p>

<p>

In a typical procedure, a mixture of aromatic aldehyde (3.0 mmol) and
sodium percarbonate (3.0 mmol) is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10.0
mL) and water (4.0 mL) and sonicated in an ultrasound bath under an
argon atmosphere. The reaction is quenched with acetic acid (1.0 mL)
and the solvent removed under vacuum. Methanol is added to the residue
and the mixture filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced
pressure and chromatographed (silica gel; 30% ethyl acetate in
hexanes).  Para-hydroxybenzaldehydes react more slowly than the
corresponding ortho-hydroxybenzaldehydes. Meta-hydroxybenzaldehyde
fails to undergo oxidation. 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde also failed
to react with
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.1,5H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which may
be due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In addition to aromatic
aldehydes, we examined the conversion of hydroxylated acetophenones to
hydroxyphenols. 2-hydroxyacetophenones (entries 11 and 13) were
oxidized to catechols while 4-hydroxyacetophenones (entries 12 and 14)
failed to undergo oxidation.

--- The End ---

<p>

Didn't find it in TFSE. Since the applied substances (sodium
percarbonate) are not only extremely OTC but also relatively cheap,
and since yields don't look that bad, SWiM thought by himself...
"hell, let's share that one" ;).  Hint: think further, think
methylating... This procudure might be an alternative to *some*
Baeyer-Villiger oxidations.
