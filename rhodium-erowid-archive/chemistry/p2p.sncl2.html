<h2>Phenyl-2-Propanones from Phenyl-2-Nitropropenes<br>Using Tin(II)chloride and Hydrochloric Acid</h2>

<p>This is a variation of the Varma and Kabalka method<a href="p2p.sncl2.html#refs"><sup>1,2</sup></a>, but they stopped at the oxime stage and said that it was just to extract the 
oxime with ether. Well the extraction of the oxime from the tin crap/sludge is a <strong>nightmare</strong>. So I thought way not render the whole 
thing acidic and hydrolyse the oxime to the ketone. At the same time the problem with the tin is no more, since both Sn(II)chloride and 
Sn(IV)chloride will stay in the water phase.</p>

<p>Tin(II)chloride is quite non-toxic and generally very nice. If desired, it's possible for the tin(II)chloride to be regenerated by electrolysis of the formed tin(IV)chloride.</p> 	 
	  	
<p>When the reduction/hydrolysis (reflux) is over there is actually no need to separate the layers. Just steam distill it as is. Toluene, ketone 
and water will distill, not the tin salts. One step less - this variation has been exemplified in <a href="p2p.sncl2.html#tmp2p">the synthesis of 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-propanone</a> (2,4,5-TMP2P - a TMA-2 precursor).</p>

<div class="exp">
<h4>First Trial: o-Fluoro-P2P</h4>

<p>18.1g (100mmol) 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-nitropropene was added dry in portions to 49.5g (220mmol) SnCl<sub>2</sub>&middot;2H<sub>2</sub>O suspended in 75ml 
EtOAc while the reaction temperature was kept between 20-40�C by a cold water bath. When all nitropropene was added and the 
color had changed to white (5 min) the EtOAc solution was transferred to a RB flask containing 250ml water and 50 ml hydrochloric 
acid. The EtOAc was removed by distillation under diminished pressure and the aqueous suspension of oxime and tin salts was 
allowed to stir at 80�C for 1 hour. The water phase was now steam distilled to remove the ketone. When no more oily drops 
came over the distillate was extracted with DCM. The DCM extracts was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and the DCM  removed by distillation leaving 
a quite pure ketone as a colorless oil.</p>
<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 13,5g (89%) 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-propanone
<br><strong>Purity:</strong> 98% (HPLC)
<br>
<strong>Properties:</strong> bp 47&deg;C/0.05 mmHg, d 1.077g/ml (according to the Aldrich Catalog).</p> 
<p>It's a clear oily liquid with a aromatic smell, quite nice. I have not distilled it yet. I rarely do so with the ketones since I get them pure enough anyway. </p>

<br>
<h4>Further Trials: Preparation of P2P and MDP2P</h4>
<p>This nitroalkene &rarr; ketoxime &rarr; ketone procedure was tried with two other phenyl-2-nitropropenes:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 30.82g (230mmol, 92%) 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) </p>

<h3>General Procedure</h3>

<p>This is a very general procedure and it has so far worked with every single phenylnitropropene I've tried. The yields has been 
in the range of 85-92%. The lower yields are very likely a result of my impatience. Longer time for hydrolysis should have given 
higher yields.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="oli">100 mmol of the phenylnitropropene</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">220 mmol (50 g) Tin(II)chloride dihydrate</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">200 mmol HCl (as a calculated amount conc. aq HCl)</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">50 ml toluene</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">200 ml water</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">NaCl (solid)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>Dissolve the tin(II)chloride in water mixed with the hydrochloric acid. Add the substrate to a rb flask and rinse it all down with the 
toluene. Now add the aqueous solution to the rb flask in one portion. With good stirring bring the mixture to a gentle reflux for 2 
hours. Chill the flask to room temp and saturate the aqueous phase with NaCl, separate the two layers and transfer the top organic 
layer to a 1L flask containing 500ml water. Steam distill until no more oily drops comes over. This means between 500ml to 1.5L 
distillate is to be collected depending on the volatility of the ketone. When the steam distillation is over the distillate consits of 
two layers, one top layer of touene and the major part of the ketone. Separate the layers in a separatory funnel and extract the 
aqueous phase with 2x100ml toluene. Combine the toluene extracts, dry them with MgSO<sub>4</sub> and remove the toluene in a rotovap. This leaves 
the ketone as a yellow oil ready for whatever you might have in mind for it.</p>

<h3>2,4,5-TMP2P Using Direct Steam Distillation</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="oli">5g (19,8mmol) 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">12.3g (55mmol) tin(II)chloride dihydrate</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">15ml conc. hydrochloric acid</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">20ml toluene</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">15ml water</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">100ml EtOAc</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Tin(II)chloride was dissolved in 15ml water and 15ml conc hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution was added to a 200ml RB 
flask containing 20ml toluene and 5g substrate. The mixture was heated to 80&deg;C on a water bath with good stirring for 1.5 hours. 
During this time the color changed from a deep yellow to dark orange and then to light yellow.</p>

<p>After 1.5 hours 200ml water was added and the toluene was removed by steam distillation. The now bright yellow aqueous phase containing 
dark yellow oily droplets was saturated with NaCl and extracted with 2x50ml EtOAc which removed all color. The ethyl acetate was washed 
once with 50ml saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution, once with 50ml water, once with brine and then dried with MgSO<sub>4</sub>. The solvent was removed in a 
rotovap leaving 3.7g of a yellow oil which slowly partially solidified to something reminding of honey.</p>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 3.7g (83.8%) 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-propanone</p>

<p><strong>Notes on the process by GC_MS:</strong></p>

<p>I was a long time ago since I tested the procedure on Rh's page, and I am currently in the need of some phenyl-2-propanone 
analogues, I wanted to re-evaluate the applicability of the method.</p>

<p>Substances: 32.6 g 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene (recrystallized from toluene), 100 g tin(II)chloride dihydrate, water and hydrochloric 
acid.</p>

<p>I allowed hydrolysis of the ketoxime for ca 1.5 h at 85-90�C. The reaction mixture was steam distilled to yield a yellow oil. 
The distillate was extracted with DCM and the combined organic phases washed with water. It is claimed that this procedure yields a 
reasonably pure product. On this, a little bit of comment...</p>

<p>For the most amongst us, this oil indeed is pure enough. However, when washing the organic phase with aqueous NaOH instead of water, 
a discoloured aqueous phase is noticed. Some chromatography showed me that there was some benzyl alcohol present. Also, the "purified" 
oil contained some benzaldehyde (ca 5%). Depending on what the purposes are of the P2P, benzaldehydes are an interfering factor 
(reductive amination).</p>
