<h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p align="left">The preparation of the optical antipodes of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
      (cathinone) from norephedrine and an improved large-scale resolution of 
      norephedrine are described. The characterization of cathinone and its salts 
      is discussed.</p>

</div>

  <p>The chewing of the leaves of Catha edulis Forsk (Khat) by the natives of 
    several Asian and African countries to provide rapid stimulation is extremely 
    prevalent<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and has been considered to be a serious problem of drug dependence 
    not unlike that associated with amphetamine<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. In fact, on the basis of the 
    observations of Eddy et al.<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> the United Nations Narcotics Laboratory undertook 
    research on the chemistry of Khat and its components<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Earlier in this century (+)-norpseudoephedrine, a CNS-active compound, was 
    identified among the basic alkaloid components of Khat<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. 
    Later investigations<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>5-8</sup></a> revealed the presence 
    of other bases, but the isolation and characterization of the main constituent 
    has only been reported within the last few years by the United Nations Narcotics 
    Laboratory<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>9,10</sup></a>. Specifically, the presence of 
    (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> and its absolute 
    configuration<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>, as well as the presence of 
    3,6-dimethyl-2,5-diphenylpyrazine<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> were reported. 
    Since this information is only available in the United Nations Documents which 
    are somewhat hard to come by<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>, it will be briefly 
    summarized here. Extraction of freeze-dried plant material with methanol, 
    followed by separation of the nonpolar and weakly basic species and purification 
    by acid-base extractions gave an odiferous yellow oil which, after treatment 
    with oxalic acid, gave a solid: mp 157-160°C<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>. 
    This compound was identified as &alpha;-amino- propiophenone oxalate by its 
    UV, IR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, and mass spectra<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>. 
    In another reports the absolute configuration of the plant extract was deduced 
    from comparison of the CD curve observed for a separately isolated sample 
    of oxalate salt with those of model compounds. It was concluded<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> 
    that natural &alpha;-aminopropiophenone has the S configuration, which is 
    biogenetically consistent with the configurations of both (+)-norpseudo- ephedrine 
    and (-)-norephedrine at the corresponding asymmetric center.</p>

  <p>These reports do, however, contain some puzzling results. The stereospecific 
    synthesis of (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone by bromination of propiophenone 
    followed by the Gabriel synthesis is claimed<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>. 
    Indeed, the melting point (175°C) reported for the hydrochloride salt of the 
    synthetic product differs substantially from that reported previously for 
    racemic &alpha;-amino- propiophenone hydrochloride (184°C (12), and 187°C<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> 
    and is in agreement with the melting point reported by Takamatsu (175-176°C<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a>) 
    for (+)-&alpha;- aminopropiophenone hydrochloride. Furthermore, it was reportedly 
    that when this salt was converted to an amine oxalate, a solid with a melting 
    point of 172-175°C, which showed no melting point depression with natural 
    cathinone oxalate, was obtained.</p>

  <p>These results seem to suggest that the stereospecific synthesis of (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    hydrochloride from propiophenone had been accomplished without the benefit 
    of optically active reagents, solvents, or resolution. Other apparent inconsistencies 
    appear in the literature relating to &alpha;-aminopropiophenone. For example, 
    the report<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> that treatment of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    with ethanolic hydrochloric acid gave (+)-&alpha;-amino-propiophenone hydrochloride, 
    mp 175-176°C, would appear to be an error presumably the <em>l</em>-mandelate 
    salt of (+)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone was treated with ethanolic hydrochloric 
    acid.</p>

  <p>In the light of increased interest in expanding the pharmacological and medical 
    investigations of the major constituents of Khat<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> and because known methods 
    of resolution of racemic &alpha;-aminopropiophenone were inadequate for the 
    preparation of gram quantities of the required antipodes of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone, 
    we undertook the development of an improved synthetic pathway to optically 
    active &alpha;-aminopropiophenone. At the same time, having pure &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    and its optical antipodes in hand, we were able to establish some of the properties 
    and chemical behavior of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone and of its salts and to 
    explain some of the literature discrepancies.</p>

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/cathinone1.gif" width="195" height="268" border="0">
</div>

  <p>Attempts to resolve (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone via the mandelate salt 
    by following the reported procedures<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>7,14</sup></a> yielded 
    only minute quantities of product in spite of the care taken to exclude light. 
    Somewhat better results were obtained with tartaric acid. Thus, (+)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    crystallized with (-)-tartaric acid and the (-) enantiomer crystallized with 
    (+)-tartaric acid. For both antipodes the yields were small, probably due 
    to the strong tendency of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone (<strong>1</strong>) 
    to cyclize to 3,6-dimethyl-2,5-diphenyldihydropyrazine (<strong>3</strong>), 
    with subsequent oxidation to 3,6-dimethyl-2,5-diphenylpyrazine (<strong>2</strong>) 
    when it is not stabilized by the presence of strong acids<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/cathinone2.gif" width="300" height="875" border="0">
</div>

  <p>Consequently, an alternative route to optically active cathinone was developed. 
    Norephedrine was resolved in high yield into its (+) and (-) antipodes with 
    O,O-dibenzoyl- d-tartaric acid<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>. Each enantiomer was converted to its N-formyl 
    derivative and oxidized with chromium trioxide in pyridine. Hydrolysis with 
    20% hydrochloric acid at 40°C gave optically pure &alpha;- aminopropiophenone 
    hydrochloride without racemization. In this manner there was obtained, from 
    racemic norephedrine, (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone in 39% overall yield and 
    the (+) enantiomer in 40% overall yield. It should be noted that use of an 
    N-acetyl blocking group in the oxidation of norephedrine to &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    was unsuitable because removal of the acetyl group led to racemization (~60%). 
    Similarly, if deprotection of N-formyl-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone was carried 
    out with weaker acid (<20% HCl) and at higher temperature (>40°C), racemization 
    was observed.</p>

  <p>An approach to the stereospecific synthesis of (S)-cathinone from (S)-N-(methoxycarbonyl)alanine 
    has been recently published<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>. The Friedel-Crafts 
    yield was reported to be 50-60%; assuming a 90% yield in removal of the N-methoxycarbonyl 
    protecting group, the overall yield obtained would be slightly higher than 
    that obtained by our method. However, whereas our approach leads to both enantiomers 
    on using a natural (and therefore relatively inexpensive) tartaric acid derivative, 
    preparation of (R)- cathinone by the procedure of McClure et al<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> 
    requires nonnatural alanine.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the melting points obtained by us for racemic and optically 
    active &alpha;-aminopropiophenone hydrochloride were practically the same (racemic, 
    mp 190-191°C; optically active, mp 189-191°C). Furthermore, our melting points 
    for the optical antipodes were substantially higher than those previously 
    reported (175-176°C)<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a>. Our experiments suggest that the low melting point 
    was observed when the samples were insufficiently dried.</p>

  <p>Because it had been found that optically active &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    racemized readily in the absence of strong acids<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a>, it occurred to us that 
    the plant extract obtained by using dilute acetic acid at room temperature 
    might have racemized to some extent during the extraction procedure and/or 
    while present as the salt of a weak acid such as oxalic acid. The hydrochloride 
    salts of (-)-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone and of the racemate were therefore converted 
    to the oxalate salts. The optically active and racemic oxalate salts had very 
    similar melting points (optically active, mp 173-175°C; racemic, mp 172-173°C), 
    as we had found for the hydrochloride salts. In addition, they did not exhibit 
    melting point depression when admixed. Thus, although optical resolution by 
    direct crystallization of mixtures of interconverting enantiomers is possible 
    in principle<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a>, the strong tendency of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    to racemize and/or cyclize when it is not stabilized by the presence of a 
    strong acid<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>13,18</sup></a> may account for the apparent 
    identity of the oxalate salt of the plant extract and of synthetic &alpha;-aminopropiophenone 
    observed<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>. Clearly, in this case the melting 
    points cannot serve as criteria for optical purity. </p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<ol>
<li><span class="oli">The optical antipodes of &alpha;-aminopropiophenone can be prepared in high yield by oxidation of optically active N-formylnorephedrine, followed by deblocking of the amino group. The resolution of nor-ephedrine is best carried out by using O,O-dibenzoyltartaric acid.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">Melting points cannot be used as criteria of the optical 
      purity of cathinone derivatives because of the <strong>(a)</strong> similarity 
      of the melting points of the racemic and optically active compound and <strong>(b)</strong> 
      lack of melting point depression upon admixing of opposite antipodes and/or 
      racemic and optically active compounds.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">The cathinone free base racemizes and dimerizes readily 
      in a hydroxylic medium. Similar behavior is observed for solutions of the 
      oxalate salt but at a somewhat reduced rate; therefore, the plant extract 
      of Schorno<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> may have been partially racemized.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The cathinone free base is fairly stable as a dilute solution in nonpolar, nonhydroxylic media, and, consequently, strong acid salts of optically active cathinone can be interconverted without racemization.</span></li>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Resolution of Norephedrine</h4>

    <p>A solution of 80 g (0.53 mol) of (-)-norephedrine in 400 mL of EtOH was 
      combined at 60°C with a solution of 95 g (0.27 mol) of O,O-dibenzoyl-<em>d</em>-tartaric 
      acid in a mixture of 100 mL of EtOH and 250 mL of i-PrOH. When the mixture 
      had cooled slightly, some seed crystals were added, and the salt was allowed 
      to crystallize undisturbed for 3 days. The clear supernatant was carefully 
      decanted from the crystal cake of (+)-norephedrine O,O-dibenzoyl-<em>d</em>-tartrate. 
      The solid was washed thoroughly with EtOH/i-PrOH, and the washings were 
      filtered into the supernatant. This operation usually caused the crystallization 
      of (-)-norephedrine O,O-dibenzoyl-<em>d</em>-tartrate in the filtrate. After 
      2 days, the (-)-norephedrine salt was collected by filtration, washed with 
      THF and dried at 120°C. The yield was 75g (86%) of (-)-norephedrine O,O-dibenzoyl-<em>d</em>-tartrate 
      and 68g (78%) of (+)-norephedrine O,O-dibenzoyl-<em>d</em>-tartrate. Both 
      products had a melting point of 190-200°C (dec). For conversion to the corresponding 
      hydrochlorides, the salts were each treated with 150 mL of 7% ethanolic 
      hydrochloric acid at 60°C for 30 min. After evaporation of the solvent, 
      the residue was triturated with THF which caused spontaneous crystallization. 
      The solid was washed with THF and EtOH and vacuum dried. From the filtrates 
      was obtained a second crop upon cooling. The following results were obtained. 
      (-)-Norephedrine hydrochloride: 40 g (81%); mp 170-172°C; (lit.<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a> 
      mp 171-172°C). (+)-Norephedrine hydrochloride: 37 g (74%); mp 170-172°C 
      (lit.<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a> mp 171-172°C).</p>


<h4>(+)-N-Formylnorephedrine</h4> 

    <p>A solution of 110 g (0.73 mol) of (+)-norephedrine in 250 mL of THF was 
      cooled in an ice bath while a mixture of 35 g (0.73 mol) of 95% formic acid 
      was added dropwise with stirring over 1 h. The pasty product was diluted 
      with ether to give 134 g (94%) of the crystaLine formate of (+)-norephedrine. 
      The formate was dissolved in 700 mL of toluene and refluxed for 2 days, 
      with the water produced being separated in a Dean-Stark trap. The syrupy 
      product (+)-N-Formylnorephedrine, which remained after evaporation of the 
      solvent and vacuum drying, weighed 115g (92%). </p>


    <h4>(+)-N-Formyl-alpha-amino-Propiophenone (23)</h4> 

    <p>An ice-cold mixture of 3 L of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and 190 g (2.4 mol) of pyridine was 
      treated with 120 g (1.2 mol) of dry CrO<sub>3</sub> which was added in portions within 
      a 30-min period. The purple-brown mixture was stirred at room temperature 
      for 2 h. A solution of 38 g (0.21 mol) of (+)-N-Formylnorephedrine in 200 
      mL CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was added to the CrO<sub>3</sub> mixture all at once with vigorous 
      mechanical stirring. After 15 min, the yellow solution was decanted from 
      a black, sticky precipitate and immediately extracted with 1 L of 5% NaOH 
      solution followed by 1 L of 10% HCl solution. The organic phase was filtered 
      through a bed of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to a clear, 
      light yellow syrup. After vacuum drying overnight, the product (+)-N-Formyl-&alpha;-amino-propiophenone 
      weighed 31 g (83% yield). The material was sufficiently pure for further 
      synthesis.</p>


    <h4>(+)-alpha-Amino-propiophenone Hydrochloride</h4>

    <p>A suspension of 21 g (0.12 mol) of (+)-N-Formyl-&alpha;-Propiophenone in 200 
      mL of 20% HCl was vigorously stirred at 40°C until a clear solution resulted 
      (~5 h). The mixture was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was crystallized 
      from i-PrOH-Et<sub>2</sub>O. After the sample was dried overnight (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-KOH), 16 g 
      (72%) of (+)-&alpha;-Aminopropiophenone HCl was obtained: mp 186-189°C. 
      One recrystallization from i-PrOH-THF gave a product: mp 186-189°C.</p>


<h4>(-)-N-Formylnorephedrine</h4> 

<p>The free base isolated from 115 g (0.62 mol) of (-)-norephedrine hydrochloride by CHCl<sub>3</sub>-aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> partition was dissolved in 250 mL of THF. While a temp of 5°C was 
maintained, a mixture of 30 g (0.7 mol) of 95% formic acid and 30 mL of THF was added dropwise over 2 h. The resulting thick suspension was diluted with 520 mL of Et<sub>2</sub>O 
and stored at room temperature for 1 h. Filtration and washing with Et<sub>2</sub>O gave 122 g of (-)-norephedrine. Filtration and washing with Et<sub>2</sub>O gave 122 g of (-)-norephedrine 
formate, mp 144-145°C. The dried formate was refluxed for 2.5 days with 800 mL of toluene in a Dean-Stark trap until all the water was removed. The solvent was then 
evaporated, and vacuum drying gave 106 g (96%) of (-)-N-formylnorephedrine as a nd vacuum drying gave 106 g (96%) of (-)-N-formylnorephedrine as a slightly yellow syrup.</p>


    <h4>(-)-alpha-Amino-propiophenone Hydrochloride</h4>

    <p>The oxidation of (-)-N-Formylnorephedrine was carried out in four portions 
      of 26.5 g with chromium trioxide-pyridine complex as described for the (+) 
      antipode. The corresponding (-)-N-formyl-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone produced 
      (91g, 83%) had the same NMR characteristics as (+)-N-formyl-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone. 
      Hydrolysis of 90g (0.5 mol) of (-)-N-formyl-&alpha;-aminopropiophenone with 
      6 N hydrochloric acid (500 mL, 3 mol) at 40°C and evaporation of the excess 
      acid provided (-)-&alpha;- Aminopropiophenone HCl as a tan solid, 65 g (69.5%). 
      Two recrystallizations from i-PrOH-Et2O gave pure product (mp 175-176°C) 
      which after vacuum drying over P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-KOH had a melting 
      point of 188-190°C (dec). The salt weighed 56 g (60%). A mixture melting 
      point with the other antipode or with racemic &alpha;-Aminopropiophenone 
      gave a depression to 176-177°C dec.<a href="cathinone.html#refs"><sup></sup></a></p>

<h4>Resolution of alpha-Aminopropiophenone With d-Tartaric Acid</h4> 

    <p>A solution of 1.8 g (0.01 mol) of &alpha;-Aminopropiophenone HCl in 10 mL water 
      was added all at once to an emulsion prepared by shaking 100 mL of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> 
      and 10 mL of 1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution. After the mixture was shaken 
      for 20 s, the organic phase was separated as soon as possible and immediately 
      added to a solution of 0.8 g (0.005 mol) of <em>d</em>- tartaric acid in 
      35 mL of EtOH. After 2 days at room temperature, 450 mg (17%) white crystals 
      (mp 162-164°C (dec)), were separated. Treatment of the salt with ethanolic 
      HCl gave (+)-&alpha;-Aminopropiophenone HCl: 280 mg (75%) from tartarate); mp 176°C.</p>
