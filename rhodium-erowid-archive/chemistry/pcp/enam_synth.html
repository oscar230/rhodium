  <P>This method is used less frequently in underground synthesis,
  but has the advantage of not involving toxic cyanide compounds.
  The first step of the reaction is the dehydration of piperidine
  and cyclohexanone to form an enamine. The addition of anhydrous
  p-toluenesulfonic acid or dry HBr produces an intermediate imminium
  salt. Reaction of this salt with phenylmagnesium bromide yields
  PCP. This method is most applicable to cyclic secondary amine
  analogs such as piperidine, pyrrolidine, or morpholine, rather
  than an acyclic N-substituent such as ethyl or dimethyl (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 8, 12</A> ).</P>
  <P>This route has an overall yield of ~70%, with a difficulty
  rating of 3 out of 10, and a hazard rating of 2 out of 10 (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 64</A>).</P><HR ALIGN="LEFT"></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P><STRONG>Step 1. Preparation of cyclohexenyl piperidine:</STRONG>
    A solution of 98 g (1.0 mole) of cyclohexanone, 100 g (1.17 mole)
    of piperidine, and 2 g (0.0105 mole) of p-toluenesulfonic acid
    in 300 ml of toluene is refluxed under azeotropic distillation
    conditions until the evolution of water stops (about 13 hours).
    The best method for this is to use a Dean Stark or Barrett water
    trap, but if one is not available, it may be improvised with
    a distillation head as described in Vogel's Textbook of Practical
    Organic Chemistry.</P>
    <P>Either p-toluenesulfonic acid or dry HBr gas can be used in
    the next step. The intermediate cyclohexenyl-piperidine (enamine)
    from the previous step is best used crude, but it can be distilled
    with adequate vacuum.</P>
    <P><STRONG>Step 2, method A. Use of p-toluenesulfonic acid:</STRONG>
    190 g<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT>of<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT>p-toluenesulfonic
    acid monohydrate in 250 ml of toluene is heated under a Dean
    Stark trap until all the water is removed. This is then added
    to 165 g of cyclohexenyl-piperidine in 500 ml of ether with ice
    cooling to keep temp at 0 deg C. A solution of 1 mole of phenylmagnesium
    bromide is prepared as in Scheme I from 157 g of bromobenzene
    and 24 g of Mg turnings in 750 ml of ether. This is added to
    the cyclohexenyl piperidine while holding the temp at 0 to 5
    deg C. The mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min after
    the dropwise addition is complete.</P>
    <P>A&nbsp;mixture of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and&nbsp;ammonium
    hydroxide is added to neutralize the excess phenylmagnesium bromide
    (approx. 100 gm of NH4Cl and 20 ml of strong NH40H in enough
    water to make a saturated solution). The ether layer is then
    removed in a separatory funnel, dried by the addition of potassium
    carbonate, filtered, and evaporated to give PCP. This can be
    converted to the hydrochloride salt by dissolving it in an excess
    of isopropanol saturated with HCl gas and precipitating with
    ether, followed by crystallization from a mixture of ether and
    isopropanol.</P>
    <P><STRONG>Step 2, method B. Use of HBr gas: </STRONG>The reaction
    mixture from step one is diluted to 2 L with dry toluene and
    dry HBr gas was bubbled through until the solution is acidic.
    The resulting slurry is added at once to a cold (5 deg. C) stirrred
    solution of phenylmagnesium bromide prepared from 236 g (1.51
    moles) of bromobenzene and 38 g of Mg (1.56 moles) in 1 L of
    dry ether. The temperature will rise to 45 C and the mixture
    should be stirred for an additional 30 minutes.</P>
    <P>300 ml of 48% aqueous HBr is then added, producing the HBr
    salt of PCP, which is filtered from the reaction mixture. The
    crude HBr salt is then basified with NaOH, extracted with hexanes,
    toluene, etc., and either evaporated to yield PCP freebase or
    treated with isopopanol saturated with HCL, followed by dilution
    with ether to give PCP hydrochloride.<BR>
