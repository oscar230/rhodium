<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>PCP (phencyclidine, or 1-phenyl-cyclohexylpiperidine (<B>figure
  1, </B>below) is the best known representative of the class of
  drugs collectively known as arylcyclohexylamines. Two other members
  of this structural class are ketamine and tiletamine. PCP was
  formerly used as a surgical anesthetic in both humans and veterinary
  practice, but it is not currently manufactured, and has been
  placed under Schedule II of the Controlled Substance Act in the
  US. Tiletamine is dispensed as a mixture with the benzodiazepine
  zolazepam (Telazol) as large animal tranquilizer, and is a Schedule
  III drug. Ketamine is used in both veterinary and human anesthesiology,
  although its predominant use in the US is in animals. [Erowid Note: Ketamine was added to Schedule III in the United States in 1999 -- Edited Jan 15 2010.] <strike>Currently
  it is not scheduled under federal law, but will most likely be
  added to schedule II or III within the next two years.</strike></P>
  <P>The other compounds shown in <B>figure 1</B>: PCPy, TCP, and
  PCE, as well as TCPy (the thiophene analog of PCPy), are potent
  PCP analogs that have appeared on the illicit market in the US
  and subsequently been added to Schedule I of the Controlled Substance
  Act. Reportedly at least 30 other unscheduled analogs that have
  been produced by clandestine sources.</P><HR ALIGN="LEFT">

  <P>This review covers the synthesis and pharmacology of the close
  structural derivatives of PCP. However, there are several other
  classes of compounds that bind to the same receptor as PCP and
  produce PCP-like effects. All together, these classes contain
  literally hundreds of potentially active drugs.</P>
  <P>Five other structural classes of compounds that produce potent
  PCP-like effects are shown in <B><A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure2">figure 2</A>
  </B>, below. All of them are known to bind at the same receptor
  site as PCP, and share at least some of its pharmacological profile
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 42</A>). These
  compounds will not be discussed here, but are pictured to illustrate
  the diversity of structures having similar effects to PCP.</P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Benz(f)isoquinolines <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref.
    43)</A>
    <LI>Propanolamines, e.g. 2-MDP
    <LI>Benzomorphans, e.g. Pentazocine (Talwin). These compounds
    have been used as analgesics and also have affinity for additional
    receptors. See information regarding <A HREF="research_refs.html#sigma">sigma
    affinity</A> below.
    <LI>Dioxolanes, e.g. Dexoxadrol and Etoxadrol <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref.
    42)</A>
    <LI>Tricyclics such as MK-801 (Dizocilpine). This class includes
    some of the most potent selective PCP receptor ligands known
    (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 38, 44</A>). MK-801
    is about 2 to3 times more potent than PCP, and is longer lasting.
    Animals that have been trained to self-inject PCP will also self-inject
    this compound, a fact that is proposed to demonstrate &quot;abuse
    potntial&quot; <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref.
    46, 47)</A>.
