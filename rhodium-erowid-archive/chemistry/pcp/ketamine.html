  <P>Ketamine is more difficult to synthesize than the previously
  considered PCP derivatives. Although it is currently a popular
  and common drug on the illicit market, it is obtained exclusively
  by diversion of commercial sources rather than synthesis. This
  route has an overall yield of ~60%, with a difficulty rating
  of 2-3 out of 10 and a hazard rating of 1-2 out of 10 (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  64</A>). The general necessity of producing anhydrous methylamine
  in a clandestine setting, rather than purchasing it, increases
  the difficulty. Use of propylamine rather than methylamine would
  simplify this reaction, as its boiling point is above room temperature
  vs. methylamine, which is a gas at room temperature.</P>
  <P>The syntheis starts with the reaction of cyclopentyl Grignard
  and o-chlorobenzonitrile to give o-chlorophenyl-cyclopentyl ketone,
  followed by alpha bromination of the ketone, and then reaction
  with methylamine to form an alpha-hydroxy imine (1-Hydroxycyclopentyl-(o-chlorophenyl)-ketone-N-methylimine).
  Heating this imine results in Ketamine via a novel alpha-hydroxyimine
  rearangement (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">refs. 20,
  21, 22, 23, 24</A> ). Overall yields are ~60%.</P>
  <P><A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure1">Tiletamine</A> is synthesized
  by an analogous process in industry, substituting 2-thiophenyl
  magnesium bromide for the phenyl grignard and ethylamine for
  methylamine. Two other ketamine analogs have been found on the
  black market: the compound missing the 2-chloro group on the
  phenyl ring, and its N-ethyl analog. Both of these compounds
  are most likely more potent and longer lasting than ketamine.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Step 1: (o-chlorophenyl)-cyclopentyl ketone</B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>119.0 g of cyclopentyl bromide and 19.4 g of magnesium are
    reacted in ether or THF to give a cyclopentyl Grignard reagent.
    The best yields are obtained if the ether solvent is distilled
    from the Grignard under vacuum and replaced with hydrocarbon
    solvent, such as benzene. 55.2 g of o-chlorobenzonitrile is then
    added to the reaction mixture and stirred for three days. The
    reaction is then hydrolyzed by pouring it onto a mixture of crushed
    ice and ammonium chloride, containing some ammonium hydroxide.
    Extracion of the mixture with organic solvent gives o-chlorophenylcyclopentylketone,
    bp 96-97 C (0.3 mm Hg) (CAS# 6740-85-8).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Step 2: alpha-bromo (o-chlorophenyl)-cyclopentyl ketone</B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>To 21.0 g of the above ketone is added 10.0 g of bromine in
    80 ml of carbon tetrachloride dropwise at 0 deg. C. After all
    of the Br2 has been added, an orange suspension forms. This is
    washed with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite and
    evaporated to give 1-bromocyclopentyl-(o-chlorophenyl)-ketone,
    bp 111-114 C (0.1 mm Hg). Yield is ~66%. This bromoketone is
    unstable and must be used immediately. Also attempts to distill
    it at 0.1 mm Hg lead to some decomposition, so it should be used
    without further purification.</P>
    <P>The bromination may also be carried out with N-bromosuccinimide
    in somewhat higher yields (~77%).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Step 3: 1-hydroxycyclopentyl-(o-chlorophenyl)-ketone-N-methylimine</B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>29.0g of above bromoketone is dissolved in 50 ml of liquid
    methylamine freebase. Benzene may also be used as solvent. After
    one hour, the excess liquid methylamine is allowed to evaporate,
    although increasing the reaction time to 4-5 days may increase
    yield. The residue is then dissolved in pentane and filtered.
    The solvent is evaporated to yield 1-hydroxy-cyclopentyl-(o-chlorophenyl)-ketone
    N-methylimine, mp 62 C (yield ~84%).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Step 4: 2-Methylamino-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexanone
  (Ketamine)</B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The final step is a thermal rearrangement, and gives almost
    quantitative yield after 180 C for 30 min. An alternative to
    the use of decalin as solvent in this step is to use a pressure
    bomb.</P>
    <P>2.0 g  of the preceeding N-methylimine is dissolved in
    15 ml of decalin and refluxed for 2.5 h. After evaporation of
    the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue is extracted
    with dilute hydrochloric acid, the solution treated with decolorizing
    charcoal, and the resulting acidic solution is made basic. The
    liberated product, 2-methylamino-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexanone
    (Ketamine), after recrystallization from pentane-ether, has a
    mp of 92-93C. The hydrochloride has a  mp of 262-263 C.</P>
    <P>As with PCE, the freebase is too caustic to be smoked, and
    must be converted into the HCl salt in order to be consumed in
    this manner.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
