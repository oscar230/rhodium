<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P> </P>
  <P>Numerous derivatives of PCP have been synthesized which contain
  additional rings systems or restrict the conformational flexibility
  of  the phenyl, cyclohexyl, and/or piperidine rings by adding
  bonds between them. Additionally, there are at least six structural
  classes of compounds that can produce PCP-like effects in animals.
  There are several reasons for continuing research on these compounds.
  First, they have unique pharmacological actions that may be developed
  into as yet unknown clinical agents. Besides the potential for
  further anesthetic agents, there is the possibility for neuroprotective
  agents, because of their ability to reduce tissue damage during
  oxygen deprivation and other trauma such as siezure. Also, if
  PCP does indeed induce a mental state that is biologically related
  to schizophrenia, then compounds that antagonize its action may
  be useful in the treatment of this disease. Finally, compounds
  that selectively bind to the PCP receptor are necessary for research
  in order to better define its physiological role.</P>
  <P>Most of the effects of PCP result from its binding to noncompetative
  NMDA receptors. PCP also binds at a number of other receptors
  with lesser affinity, and many derivatives have been synthesized
  with much more selectivity for these other receptors. There are
  several research areas on those analogs that have recieved particular
  interest.</P>

<P><A NAME="dopa"></A><B>1) Areas for research: dopamine receptors:</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>One facinating example of modification to PCP's structure
  results in a class of compounds with entirely different and novel
  actions. This is the replacement of the phenyl ring with a benzothiophene
  ring to give the derivative BTCP, illustrated below.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="pictures/btcp.gif" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="136" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>These compounds show little affinity for the PCP receptor,
  but some are very potent at blocking dopamine reuptake. Some
  of these compounds, such as 1-[1-(2 benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]pyrrolidine,
  the analog of BTCP in which the piperidine ring has been replaced
  with pyrrolidine, bind to the cocaine receptor site with potency
  greater than cocaine itself. Members of this family also bind
  to a second site on the dopamine transporter receptor that is
  distinct from cocaine's binding site. This discovery has raised
  hopes of medicinal chemists that a derivative of BTCP may be
  developed that would anagonize the actions of cocaine and be
  of use in cocaine addiction <A HREF="research_refs.html#References">(ref. 27, 28,
  40, 41, 39)</A>. Conversely, the discovery of BTCP's ability
  to bind to cocaine receptors has also raised hopes among clandestine
  chemists for a potent, easy to synthesize cocaine-like compound.</P>
  <P>As of yet, there has not been a formal evaluation of BTCP
  derivatives in man, but testing in animals has revealed the possibilty
  that some of these compounds may be effective stimulants similar
  to cocaine. In one unstructured and informal assay of BTCP's
  effects in man by vaporization and inhalation, no subjective
  effects were apparent. However, there is the possibility that
  the dosage employed was not high enough to produce discernable
  effects (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 14</A>). Additionally, the
  pyrrolidine analog of BTCP would be a more logical choice for
  evaluation in man as it has a higher affinity at cocaine's binding
  site.</P>
  <P>Synthesis of these compounds is achieved readily through the
  enamine route for PCP (<A HREF="enam_synth.html#enamine">reaction
  scheme II</A>), by substituting 2-lithio benzothiophene for phenyl
  lithium. The 2-lithio benzothiophene reagent can be prepared
  by reacting benzothiophene (also known as thianaphene) with butyl
  lithium. Method I for PCP, using the nitrile intermediate is
  also effective (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 39</A>).</P>

<P><A NAME="sigma"></A><B>2. Areas for research: sigma receptors:</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Another class of binding sites discovered during research
  on PCP derivatives are the sigma receptors. Initially the sigma
  receptor was thought to be the site by which PCP produced its
  psychoactivity. However,recent studies indicate that although
  PCP binds to the sigma receptor its pharmacology is more due
  to interaction at a noncompetative NMDA binding site (the &quot;PCP
  receptor&quot;). Many compounds that bind to the PCP receptor
  also bind at sigma sites. Interestingly, some compounds that
  produce similar bizarre alterations in consciousness as PCP and
  have rather low affinity at PCP receptors, such as the benzomorphans
  <A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure2">(figure 2</A>), have a higher
  affinity for sigma sites. such compounds is seen. Another example
  is dextromethorphan (DXM), which of is known to cause unusual
  dissociative mental states at higher doses.</P>
  <P>The best known compound with appreciable affinity for the
  sigma receptor is the benzomorphan Pentazocine (Talwin, <A HREF="pcp_struc.html#Figure2">figure
  2</A>). This drug is a mixed agonist/antagonist at opiate receptors
  and generally has lower abuse potential in opiate (ab)users than
  pure agonists such as morphine. However, this drug is more desired
  than other opiates by certain users. When it is injected intravenously,
  especially in combination with an antihistamine (so-called &quot;T's
  and Blues&quot;), it may produce a euphoric rush that is said
  to be unique and overwhelmingly pleasurable. It also may produce
  a dissociative state with similarities to PCP. All in all, there
  is not enough evidence to say with any certainty what the sigma
  receptor's physiological function is, but the possibility that
  it may be playing a role in dissociative states remains an interesting
  area for future research.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

opiate receptors:</STRONG></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A number of PCP analogs have been found to have an analgesic
  action. This action is due in a number of cases to their affinity
  at opiate receptors, and the compounds generally show a reduced
  affinity for PCP receptors. One example is the analogs with a
  hydroxy group on the 4-position of the phenyl ring, one of which
  is twice as potent as morphine (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 49</A>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
