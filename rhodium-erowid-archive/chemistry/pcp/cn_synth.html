<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The clandestine chemistry of PCP has been previously reviewed
  in two excellent articles (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  9, 64</A>). In one of these, each method was rated by yield,
  difficulty, and hazard on a scale of one to ten (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref
  64</A>). These ratings are included in this review at the beginning
  of each section, although in some cases they are open to debate.</P>
  <P>There are three fairly direct methods for synthesis of PCP
  and its derivatives: those employing a nitrile intermediate (<A HREF="cn_synth.html#scheme1">Scheme I</A>), those employing an enamine intermediate
  (<A HREF="enam_synth.html#enamine">Scheme II</A>), and those
  employing a imine intermediate (<A HREF="imine_synth.html">Scheme
  III</A>). The method of choice depends on which particular analog
  is desired, as well as what reagents are available.</P>
  <P>There are five other promising routes to PCP analogs that
  have appeared in the literature but not received as much attention
  by clandestine chemists. Routes IV, V, and VI yield 1-phenyl-1-cyclohexylamine
  (PCA), which is an active drug itself, and can also be used as
  an intermediate in synthesis of PCP and other more potent analogs.</P>
  <P>Schemes IV and V involve the use of 1-phenyl-1-cyclohexanol
  (PCOH) as an intermediate. In <A HREF="pca_synth.html#SchemeIV">Scheme
  IV</A>, the PCOH is transformed to PCA through an azide intermediate.
  In <A HREF="pca_synth.html#ritter">Scheme V</A>, the PCOH is
  reacted with NaCN and H2SO4 to give N-formyl PCA (Ritter reaction),
  which can then be hydrolyzed to PCA with acid or base. The PCOH
  used for these reactions can be prepared from cyclohexanone and
  phenylmagnesium bromide or phenyllithium or obtained commercially.</P>
  <P>Another synthesis that used PCA as an intermediate is <A HREF="pca_synth.html#scheme_vi">Scheme VI</A>. This method starts
  with phenylacetonitrile, reacts it with 1,5-dibromopentane to
  give 1-phenyl cyclohexanecarbonitrile, and hydrolyzes to the
  nitrile to 1-phenyl cyclohexanecarboxamide. The amide can then
  undergo Beckmann rearrangement, yielding N-formyl PCA, which
  is hydrolyzed to PCA. The PCA can be alkylated to PCP with 1,5-dibromopentane
  as in the previous methods .</P>
  <P>Probably the most promising alternative method of synthesis
  is shown in <A HREF="bzp_synth.html">Scheme VII</A>. In this
  method, N-benzoyl piperidine is reacted with the lithium or magnesium
  derivative of 1,5-dibromopentane to give PCP in one step.</P>
  <P>The final method reviewed here is applicable to analogs in
  which there is a ketone group at the 2-position of the cyclohexane
  ring, and is illustrated for the <A HREF="ketamine.html">synthesis
  of ketamine</A>. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The most commonly used method for PCP production in clandestine
  labs is based on the Bruylants reaction, that is displacement
  of an alpha-amino nitrile by an organometallic reagent (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  4</A>). The general outline of this reaction is shown in <B>Scheme
  I</B>. There are two steps: preparation of a nitrile intermediate
  (PCC), and reaction of this intermediate with a grignard reagent.
  The PCC intermediate can be synthesized through several routes,
  two of which are illustrated here. A typical clandestine batch
  operation might be run on a 3 to 5 molar scale, and is usually
  limited by the amount of piperidine to be employed (usually a
  maximum of 500 gm).</P>
  <P>This route has an overall yield of ~60%, with a difficulty
  rating of 2 out of 10, and a hazard rating of 4 out of 10 (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 64</A>).</P><HR ALIGN="LEFT"></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><A NAME="Generalscheme1"></A>This route is generally applicable
  to analogs that contain a cyclic amine (such as piperidine, C-alky
  piperidines, pyrrolidine, C-alky pyrrolidines, morpholine and
  N-methylpiperazine), and is also generally applicable for aromatic
  Grignard reagents (phenyl, halophenyl, toluyl, anisyl, trifluorotoluyl,
  and thienyl). It also has been applied successfully to non-cyclic
  secondary and primary amines such as dimethylamine and ethylamine
  (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 7, 10, 11</A>).
  There are two equally acceptable methods for preparation of the
  PCC intermediate: use of the hydrochloride salt of piperidine,
  and use of the bisulfite adduct of cyclohexanone.</P>
  <P>It should be born in mind that the PCC intermediate is toxic.
  It is also somewhat difficult to separate from the final product
  if the reaction is not carried out to completion. Thus, in one
  study up to 20% of street samples of PCP contained measurable
  amounts of PCC. Ingestion of PCC in small amounts can cause toxic
  symptoms, such as headache and hangover. Larger amounts cause
  more severe symptoms. Handling of the material may also cause
  dizziness, faintness, and vomiting. Additionally, repeated exposure
  to PCC may cause an aggravated psychosis and result in sensitization,
  in which an individual may experience contact dermatitis from
  trace amounts of the substance.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Pyrrolidine can be substituted for piperidine in either of
  the two following methods for synthesis of PCC in order to make
  PCPy, the pyrrolidine analog of PCP. The only difference is that
  the nitrile product (pyrrolidinyl-cyclohexyl-carbonitrile) does
  not crystallize as readily as PCC does from the reaction mixtue.
  If the nitrile does not crystallize after 24 hr., it is extracted
  with hexanes, dried with sodium sulfate, and evaporated to give
  the crystalline product, or the dry hexanes solution can used
  directly in the next step for addition to the grignard reagent.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="PCC1"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Synthesis of PCC, method
1:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The first method involves reacting cyclohexanone with the
  hydrochloride salt of piperidine and aqueous NaCN or KCN (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref 11</A>) . This is the&nbsp;most
  direct method, and is the one most commonly used in clandestine
  labs. Although it has not been reported, there appears to be
  some danger of evolving deadly HCN gas when following this procedure.
  To reduce this danger, the reaction should be done with very
  good ventilation, and the amount of acid carefully regulated
  so that the solution is in the correct pH range. If the solution
  becomes too acidic, the danger of HCN evolution will increase.
  After the solution has been allowed to stand overnight, the PCC
  will generally&nbsp; crystallize in beautiful ice-like forms.
  If the PCC has not crystallized after standing overnight, the
  common procedure in clandestine labs is to extract the solution
  with white gasoline (Coleman's fuel) or benzene, and dry the
  solution by the addition of an anhydrous salt such as magnesium
  sulfate, calcium chloride, or potassium carbonate. This solution
  of PCC in solvent may now be used directly in the next step for
  addition to the phenyl magnesium bromide.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><BR>
    <B>Procedure:</B> Piperidine, 85 g (99 ml, 1 mole) is carefully
    mixed with 84 ml of conc. HCl and 200 g of ice-water, and the
    pH is adjusted to 3-4. To this solution, 98 g (104 ml, 1 mole)
    of cyclohexanone is added, followed by 68 g (1.0 mole) of KCN
    in 150 ml of H2O (or 116 ml of 40% aqueous NaCN) without external
    cooling but with efficient stirring. After 2 hr. the solution
    is allowed to stand overnight, the crystalline precipitate is
    collected, washed with cold water and dried. The yield of PCC
    sufficiently pure for the next step is 169-182 g. (88-95%) mp
    63-68 C.</P>

<P><A NAME="PCC2"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Synthesis of PCC, Method
2:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The second method of PCC synthesis involves the addition of
  cyclohexanone to an aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3),
  producing the bisulfite adduct. Addition of KCN or NaCN results
  in formation of PCC (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  10</A>). This method is very easy and avoids the possibility
  of HCN evolution.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><BR>
    <B>Procedure: </B>12.6g of sodium bisulfite is dissolved in 42
    mL of H2O. 10.6 g of cyclohexanone is added with vigorous stirring.
    The bisulfite adduct forms immediately as a thick white slurry.
    The slurry is then cooled with an ice bath, and a solution of
    7.86g KCN and 9.48 g piperidine is added. After stirring overnight
    at room temperature followed by cooling in an ice bath, the PCC
    will crystallize. The product is then filtered off, washed with
    water, and dried (<I>in vacuo</I> at 30 C if possible) to give
    10.9 grams (86.6%) of material, mp 70-71.5 C, bp 118 C (2.5 mm
    Hg). Distillation is not recommended or necessary. If the PCC
    fails to crystallize, it can be extracted with solvent and dried,
    as above.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CENTER><A NAME="genmeth1"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Scheme I,
step 2. Reaction of PCC to give PCP:</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In the last step of the traditional synthesis, a Grignard
  reagent (phenyl magnesium bromide) is formed by the interaction
  of bromobenzene and Magnesium metal. The PCC from the preceding
  step is then reacted with the Grignard reagent to produce the
  final compound. The most important factor for success of this
  reaction is total dryness. All of the glassware and chemicals
  used must be absolutely dry. The glassware can be conveniently
  dried by baking it in an oven for some time before use. Either
  anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethyl ether can be used as
  solvent for this reaction. THF is somewhat better for small scale
  reactions because the reagent forms more readily in it and PCC
  is soluble in it, whereas it is almost entirely insoluble in
  ether.</P>
  <P>Although formation of the Grignard reagent is powerfully inhibited
  by traces of water on the scale normally encountered in an experimental
  laboratory, it is much easier to initiate on larger scale. Thus,
  in production-sized clandestine operations, the entire reaction
  has been carried out in plastic garbage cans without any great
  care being taken to ensure dryness. In this case, there seems
  to be a critical mass in regards to initiation of the reaction.</P>
  <P>Various analogs of PCP can be synthesized by this method by
  substituting another aryl halide for bromobenzene. For instance,
  use of 2-bromothiophene results in TCP, and 2-methoxy bromobenzene
  results in 2-methoxy PCP.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

(PCP) via nitrile method:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>Procedure: </B>A solution of 39 g (0.203 mole) of PCC is
    prepared in 50:50 ether:benzene (or better solvents such as THF,
    hexanes/ether, or toluene/ether. This is added slowly to phenyl
    magnesium bromide prepared from 79 g (57 ml, 0.53 mole) of bromobenzene
    and 12.3 g (0.505 mole) of Mg turnings in 200 ml of dry ether.
    The mixture is then heated and stirred for 3 hrs and cooled.
    After cooling, 175 ml (0.7 equivalents) of 4 <I>N</I> aqueous
    HBr is slowly added , followed by overnight cooling in a refrigerator.
    Precipitated PCP hydrombromide is filtered off, air-dried, and
    dissolved in a minimum amount of hot ethanol. The hot solution
    is basified with ethanolic NaOH, which deposits a heavy yellow
    oil tht quickly crystallizes. After cooling, crystals of PCP
    base with minor amounts of inorganics are filtered off, dried
    and dissolved in benzene (or toluene). One third of the benzene
    is distilled off to remove water from the solution via azeotropic
    drying. After the solution has cooled, it is diluted with 2 volumes
    of dry ether. Saturation with dry HCl deposits PCP hydrochloride,
    which is filtered off to yield about 40 g (70%), mp 243-244 C.</P>
    <P>The physical properties of the pyrrolidine analog (PCPy) prepared
    by ths method are bp 114-123 C at 0.14 mm, and mp 44-45 C after
    recrystallization from isooctane. The mp of the hydrochloride
    salt is 235-237 C.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Formation of the Grignard reagent: </B>The reaction is
  most conveniently carried out in a two-neck flask, but a single
  necked flask will work. Magnesium shavings and a magnetic stirbar
  are introduced into a previously dried round bottom flask. The
  flask is then held over a gas flame and rotated until the magnesium
  is quite hot. This will remove any water from its surface. A
  condenser and drying tube are attached to the flask and it is
  allowed to cool. In a second flask, bromobenzene (or equimolar
  amount of chlorobenzene) is mixed with THF or ether and poured
  into an addition funnel. Enough solvent is added to the flask
  to cover the Mg shavings. Approximately one quarter of the bromobenzene
  solution is added to the flask with stirring, and the cooling
  water to the condenser is turned on. If the reaction does not
  begin within 10 min., steps are taken to initiate it (<B>Note
  1</B>). The start of the reaction is apparent by the presence
  of bubbles, a grayish precipitate forming, and the solvent beginning
  to reflux.</P>
  <P>Once the reaction is progressing smoothly, the ether/bromobenzene
  is added slowly at a rate sufficient to maintain reflux without
  external heating. After it has all been added, the flask is gently
  heated at reflux until almost all of the magnesium has disappeared.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><B>Note 1. Initiation of Grignard reaction:</B> If the reaction
  does not begin within 10 min, there are a number of ways to initiate
  it. It is important not to add more bromobenzene until the reaction
  has begun. Otherwise the reaction may suddenly start and become
  violently out of control. A dishpan full of ice water should
  be on hand to cool the flask in case this happens. It should
  also be noted that the reagent can react violently with water
  once formed, and possibly ignite. If the flask were to break
  inside the water bath, the results could be disastrous. <BR>
<BR>
  <B>Different techniques used to initiate the reaction:</B></P>
  <OL>
    <LI>A dry glass rod is inserted into the neck of the flask and
    used to crush some of the Mg chips against the bottom.
    <LI>Several grams of Mg shavings are added to a flame dried test
    tube followed by several mL each of ether and bromobenzene. A
    dry glass rod is then inserted into the tube and some of the
    Mg chips are crushed against its bottom. This small scale reaction
    should start almost immediately. Once it is underway, the contents
    are poured into the reaction vessel.
    <LI>Stirring is stopped, a TINY crystal of Iodine is added to
    the flask, and the reaction allowed to stand until it starts.
    <LI>The flask is heated gently until the solvent begins to reflux.
    The heat is then removed and the flask is watched for signs of
    reaction. <BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Notes on reaction of PCC and the Grignard
reagent:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If THF is used for solvent, the PCC is dissolved in it in
  a small flask. If ether is being used, a cosolvent will be necessary
  to dissolve the PCC. Suitable solvents are dry&nbsp;hexanes,
  toluene, benzene, naphtha, or white gasoline (distilled). White
  gas is a solvent commonly used in clandestine labs. A ratio of
  1.25 moles of Grignard reagent to 1 mole of PCC is the minimum
  that should be employed. If the Grignard can be increased to
  a 2 to1 ratio, then the yield of the final product can be as
  high as 65% based on the amount of piperidine employed.</P>
  <P>Enough solvent is added to a flask to dissolve the PCC, and
  approximately half as much ether is added. The solution of PCC
  is then added via the addition funnel to the reaction slowly
  and with stirring. When it has all been added heat is applied
  to the flask, which is maintained at reflux for at least 3 hrs.
  Note that use of phenyl lithium instead of phenylmagnesium bromide
  results in failure via addition to the nitrile rather than displacement.
  However, in the presence of a Lewis acid, phenyllithium will
  displace the nitrile group and yield the desired product (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref. 30, 31, 32</A>). Primary
  amino analogs of PCC, such as N-ethylamino cyclohexanecarbonitrile
  will produce the desired PCP analogs by reaction with 3 moles
  of phenyllithium (<A HREF="research_refs.html#References">ref.
  10-11</A>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="anchor326815"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Notes on quenching
the reaction and isolating the final compound:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Method 1:</B> This is the simplest method, and is the most
  common one used in clandestine labs. One drawback is the potential
  for formation of troublesome emulsions from the Mg salts precipitated
  at basic pH during extraction. This can especially be a problem
  if ether/benzene was used to dissolve the PCC in the reaction.</P>
  <P>Several hundred cm3 of crushed ice are placed in a beaker
  along with ~15 gm of ammonium chloride and 10 ml of ammonium
  hydroxide. The ammonium hydroxide can be left out, but it is
  beneficial. The contents of the reaction flask are slowly poured
  onto the ice/NH4Cl with stirring. After the bubbling has stopped
  and the ice has melted, the beaker is poured into a separatory
  funnel along with 30 ml of solvent such as hexanes, toluene,
  chloroform, dichloromethane, etc. For the first extraction, the
  funnel is shaken gently, which helps avoid formation of an emulsion.
  The aqueous layer is extracted two more times with solvent, and
  the solvent layers are pooled. The combined organic layers are
  then extracted 3 times with dilute HCl. The acid layers are basified
  with NaOH, and the product is extracted with organic solvent.
  Evaporation of the solvent yields the oily PCP freebase, which
  may crystallize slowly, possibly taking several days to weeks.</P>
  <P>If the desired method of administration is smoking, the compound
  is left as the freebase. If the compound is to be administered
  nasally, by injection, or orally, the base is crystallized as
  the HCl salt. In order to do this the base is dissolved in ether
  and HCl gas bubbled in. The HCl salt precipitates, is washed
  with ether, and allowed to dry. An alternative, low tech and
  dirty method commonly used in clandestine labs is to add the
  calculated amount of concentrated HCl followed by evaporation
  to yield the salt.</P>
  <P><B>Method 2:</B> Aqueous HBr can also be used to hydrolyze
  the reaction mixture. This method is illustrated above. It has
  the distinct advantage of allowing the separation of any unreacted
  PCC. It also avoids the possibility of troublesome emulsions
  from precipitated magnesium salts during workup. However, it
  may be less suitable if THF has been used as the solvent for
  the Grignard reaction. In this case, the THF may dissolve some
  of the PCP hydrobromide and reduce yields. Also, the HBr salt
  of PCP can be extracted from the quenched reaction mixture with
  chloroform.</P>
  <P><B>Method 3: </B>The product may also be isolated simply by
  decantation of the solvent from the reaction mixture followed
  by addition of concentrated HCl to form the HCl salt, followed
  by purification via acid/base extraction. This method has been
  used in large low tech clandestine PCP labs.</P>
