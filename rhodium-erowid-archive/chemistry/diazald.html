<h2>A rapid, safe and convenient procedure for<br>the preparation and use of diazomethane</h2>

<div class="stdtxt">

<p>Diazomethane can be generated from a wide variety of precursors by adopting methods<a href="diazald.html#refs"><sup>1-5</sup></a> which employ dangerous 
and time-consuming distillations and collection of the gaseous reagent. A certain degree of safety may be 
attained by using special sets of distillation glassware which are commercially available at relatively high 
cost. Small quantities of diazomethane frequently employed in routine work are generally taken from a supply 
of the reagent, prepared as above, which has to be stored in the cold or is generated as required using either 
expensive commercial microapparatus or custom-made apparatus<a href="diazald.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The author has developed a technique which permits the rapid and safe generation of diazomethane and its 
simultaneous reaction with the substrate, using an apparatus which can be easily and cheaply assembled with 
ordinary glassware in a few minutes. This technique works equally on the mole, millimole and analytical scales.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of a Buckner-type conical flask (<strong>A</strong>) fitted with a magnetic bar and a rubber stopper. 
The stopper bears two holes: the first one is closed with a rubber septum and the second one accommodates a 
L-shaped glass tube which is connected at both ends to polythene tubing. The side arm of flask (<strong>A</strong>) is connected 
to an Erlenmeyer flask (<strong>B</strong>) through polythene tubing, as shown in the Figure. Flask (<strong>A</strong>) is charged with the 
required amount of <em>p</em>-toluenesulphonylmethylnitrosamide (Diazald<a href="diazald.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>) suspended in 5 times its weight of ethanol 
(it is assumed that 1g of fresh Diazald generates ca 3 mmol of diazomethane). Flask (<strong>B</strong>) is charged with the 
substrate dissolved in a suitable solvent and cooled with an ice-bath. A good stream of nitrogen is then 
allowed to pass through the whole system, while a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is dripped 
into flask (<strong>A</strong>) at intervals via the rubber septum by means of a hypodermic syringe. After a few seconds yellow 
diazomethane begins to evolve and to pass into flask (<strong>B</strong>) where reaction with the substrate occurs. Sodium 
hydroxide solution is added till the yellow colour in flask (<strong>A</strong>) is discharged.</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3><p><strong>The following example illustrates the method:</strong></p> 

<p>Flask (<strong>B</strong>) is charged with phenoxy-acetamidopenicillanic acid 1-oxide (20g, 55 mmol) dissolved in methylene 
dichloride (400 mL) and ethanol (10 mL) and cooled to 0�C. Flask (<strong>A</strong>) is charged with Diazald (18g, 84 mmol) 
(corresponding to ca 59 mmol diazomethane) suspended in ethanol (110 mL) and the mixtureis stirred while 
nitrogen is allowed to flow into the system. Sodium hydroxide solution is added dropwise until the Diazald 
dissolves, then at a rate of 1 mL every 30 sec. till the yellow colour in the flask (<strong>A</strong>) is discharged. TLC 
monitoring of the solution in flask (<strong>B</strong>) showed complete methylation of the acid.</p>
</div>

<p>This method has been widely adopted in this and other laboratories<a href="diazald.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> for several years and, due to its 
simplicity and safety, may be performed by unqualified technicians.</p>
