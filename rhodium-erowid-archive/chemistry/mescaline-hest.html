<h3>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylalcohol</h3>

  <p>50g (280 mmol) 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde was dissolved in 600mL methanol at 0�C (ice-bath) under stirring. Then
10g NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added in 3 portions and the reaction was left overnight with continued stirring.</p>
    <p>The next day most of the methanol was removed under vacuum (important to get a nice extraction) and the residue
diluted with water (500mL) and made acid with 37% HCl. The aqueous solution was extracted with 4x100mL CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, the
organic phases was combined, dried and concentrated under vacuum.</p>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 47.2g (93%) 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylalcohol,
<br>TLC R<sub>f</sub> 0.27 (40% EtOAc in Heptane)</p>


<h3>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylbromide</h3>

  <p>47.2g (240 mmol) 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde was dissolved into 1L ether at 0�C (ice-bath) under stirring.
Then 25g (100 mmol) PBr<sub>3</sub> was added over 30min, the ice-bath removed and the reaction left to stir for 60 min.
After that the mixture was poured into 300mL water, the organic phase was separated, the aqueous phase extracted
with 2x100mL ether, the ether phases combined, washed with 2x50mL water, dried and concentrated (under vacuum).</p>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 55g (88%) 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylbromide, 
<br>TLC R<sub>f</sub> 0.63 (50% EtOAc in Heptane)</p>


<h3>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl Cyanide</h3>

<p>50g (190 mmol) 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylbromide was dissolved into 600mL DMF under stirring at 0�C (ice-bath), then
20g NaCN vas added and the ice-bath removed. After 1 hour the mixture was poured into 2L water, the water was
extracted with 4x100mL CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The organic phases was combined, washed with 2x100mL water, dried and concentrated.</p>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 36g (90%) 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl cyanide, 
<br>TLC R<sub>f</sub> 0.45 (50% EtOAc in heptane)</p>

<h3>3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenethylamine (Mescaline)</h3>

<p>15g (70 mmol) 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylcyanide was dissolved in 100mL ethanol, 10mL 37% hydrochloric acid and
100mg 10% Pd/C was added and the mixture was hydrogenated at 5.5 bar for 12 hours, then the mixture was
filtered, most of the ethanol was evaporated off, then the mixture was dissolved into 200mL water, extracted
with 50mL ether (to remove unreacted starting material etc.), made basic with NaOH, extracted with 3x40mL
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and the pooled organic phases was combined, dried and evaporated.</p>

<p><strong>Yield:</strong> 13.7g Mescaline freebase.</p>
