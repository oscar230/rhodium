<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Oxime ethers can be efficiently metallated at the alpha-carbon atoms and the derived enolate equivalents (1) can then participate in a variety of useful C-C bond forming reactions. <sup>1</sup>
The alpha-carbon might also support a positive charge [i.e. (2)] stabilized by n-type electron delocalization from the oxime group, and this cation could act as a synthetic equivalent of an 1-acylcarbonium ion <sup>2</sup>.
In this communication we describe a method for the conversion of oxime ethers into functionalized ketones using reactive intermediates of type (1) or (2), employing acetone O-methyloxime as a model compound.</p>

<p>The bromo-oxime ethers (4) and (5) were also converted into a reactive intermediate of type (2) which reacted in aromatic substitution reactions. Addition of 10mmol of
either (4) or (5) in 20 ml of dry DCE to a solution of 10 mmol of AgBF<sub>4</sub> and 10mmol of the aromatic compound in 20ml of DCE at 25�C followed by efficient
stirring in the dark for 18hr and then work-up with a 10% KCN-H<sub>2</sub> solution gave good  (82-91%) yields of the aromatic substitution products (7a-e)
<sup><strong>*</strong></sup>   as the E-isomers. Acid treatment of (7a-e) (HCl-H<sub>2</sub>O-MeOH 1:5:5) for 10 hrs at 65�C and distillation gave the corresponding
arylacetones (8a-e) in high (90%) yield.</p>

<p><sup><strong>*</strong></sup>  The geometry of the oxime ether moiety was elucidated on the basis of the chemical shift of the ketone Me group in the <sup>2</sup>H NMR
spectrum (CCl<sub>4</sub>) e.g. the methyl hydrogens resonate at 2.01 in (4) but in (5) they are at 1.96. In (6), it is at 1.79 (E-isomer having 1.91) for (7a-e) the
resonances are at 1.71, 1.70, 1.70, 1.71 and 1.74 respectively.  Whereas the corresponding Z-isomers are at 1.75, 1.73, 1.74, 1.75 and 1.76 respectively. (see also Ref. 3).</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>Lithiation of acetone O-methyloxime (3) was achieved with 1.2M solution of <sup>n</sup>BuLi in THF-hexane in 5 min at �65.   Addition of lithiated (3) to molecular bromine in
THF at �65�C over 15 min resulted in the formation of the Z-bromo-oxime ether,. ).  Isomerization of (4) in CHCl<sub>3</sub>-HBr gave the thermodynamically favored E-isomer.
(5) <sup><strong>+</strong></sup>  The halogen atom could be exchanged for alkoxy by treatment of (5) with 1.1eq. of MeO[CH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>ONa in THF for 12hr to (6) in 88% yield.</p>
