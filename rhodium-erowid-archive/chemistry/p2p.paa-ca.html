<p><i><b>CXVIII.-</b>The Preparation of Mixed Ketones by Heating the Mixed Calcium Salts of Organic Acids.</i>
<br><b>J. Chem. Soc. 81, 1185-1193 (1895)</b>
</p>

<p><center>By Ernest Bowman Ludlam M.Sc. (Vict.).</center></p>

<p>

The method of heating a calcium salt in a sulphur vapour bath so as to
form the corresponding ketone and of removing the ketone, as soon as
formed, by a current of carbon dioxide (Young, Trans., 1981,
<b>59</b>, 623) gave such remarkably good results in the case of
dibenzyl ketone that it seemed desirable to test its general
applicability, and, in particular, to extend the method to the case of
mixtures of calcium salts.

</p>

<p>

<i>[...]</i>

</p>

<p>

The acids first employed were acetic and phenylacetic. On heating
mixtures of the calcium salts of these two acids, dimethyl, methyl
benzyl, and dibenzyl ketones are obtained, and as they boil
respectively at 56�, 217�, and 330�, there is no difficulty in
separating them by fractional distillation. Moreover, the mixed ketone
contains the two radicles methyl and benzyl, which were sufficiently
unlike to render the ketone a suitable one for further investigation.

</p>

<p>

Subsequently calcium phenylacetate was distilled with calcium
propionate and with calcium butyrate respectively. The fractionation
of the ketones obtained from these salts was again quite an easy
operation.

</p>

<p>

<b><i><center>Preparation of Methyl Benzyl Ketone.</center></i></b>

</p>

<p>

The preparation was carried out with various proportions of the two
salts, starting with a slight excess of calcium phenylacetate, then
using molecular proportions of the two, and, later, increasing the
proportion of acetate.

</p>

<p>

(1) In the first distillation, 20 grams of calcium acetate, previously
well dried by heating in an air-bath to 140�, were thoroughly mixed
and ground in a mortar with 45 grams of dry calcium phenylacetate, the
latter weight being 5 grams in excess of the calculated quantity
required to form a molecular mixture.

</p>

<p>

The mixed salts were placed in a parting flask and heated to the
temperature of boiling sulphur; a current of washed and dried carbon
dioxide was passed through and maintained until the decomposition was
complete. During the heating, there was just a little frothing, but
although the mass became viscid and semi-transparent it did not become
quite liquid. The ketone collected in the capillary tube in columns
which were carried over into the receiver by the current of carbon
dioxide. Towards the close of the distillation, the product became
darker in colour and white fumes were formed, which condensed with
difficulty, forming a dark coloured oil.

</p>

<p>

<i>[...]</i>

</p>

<p>

   From a practical point of view, the figures in Table IX
show that the best yield of mixed ketone obtainable from a given
weight of the more expensive salt, in this case calcium phenylacetate,
is obtained by using a large excess of the cheaper salt.

<p>

The increase in the yield shown in experiment 5 as compared with that
in experiment 1 is sufficiently marked. The intermediate stages are
fairly well represented by the figures as displayed, with the
exception of experiment 3, owing to the fact that in this experiment
the yield of all three ketones was poor. There is little doubt that
the average number of experiments would have yielded a value nearer 45
than 37 when the errors due to a single experiment were eliminated.</p>

<p><b>The yield of Phenyl-2-Propanone in Expt. 5 is 59%, based on phenylacetic acid.</b></p>
