<p>This synthesis of Indanylamphetamine [IAP, 1-(5-Indanyl)-2-aminopropane] was loosely based on the 
<a href="iap.html">synthesis of IAP earlier posted by Rhodium</a>, but 
quite a few changes were made to the final steps due to LAH not being at hand at the moment.</p>

<p>All the steps and intermediates has been documented in this photo-essay, and by clicking any of

<h3>Synthesis of Indane-5-carboxaldehyde </h3>

<p>30 grams (253.8 mmol) of indane was dissolved in 300 ml DCM in a 1 L RBF in 
    an ice bath. 42 ml (72.3 g, 381 mmol) of TiCl<sub>4</sub> was added. This 
    stuff is super nasty. It is a fuming liquid with a vapor pressure that will 
    push fluid out of a pipet in a smoking, lung burning stream when trying to 
    transfer it. A syringe and fume hood should be used if you are not an idiot 
    like this experimenter. The color of the solution changed from clear to slightly 
    brown. 29.2 grams (253.8 mmol) of dichloromethyl methyl ether, which is also 
    a nasty lung burning liquid, was added with an addition funnel over a time 
    period of about 15 minutes. The reaction is exothermic so care should be taken 
    to not add it too fast. The solution became a deep red color. After 30 minutes 
    the ice bath was removed and 375 ml ice-cold water was added at once. The 
    vigorous reaction that occurred caused an untrivial amount of the solution 
    to spew out of the top of the flask. The contents of the flask were transferred 
    to a 1 L sep-funnel. Then the aqueous layer was discarded and the organic 
    layer was washed 3x300 ml water. During the first water wash, the color of 
    the organic layer turned from deep red to light brown, maybe as the product 
    was uncomplexed from the Ti atom. Then the organic layer was washed 3x150 
    ml 3M HCl and 2x150 ml brine. Then the DCM was removed at the rotovap and 
    the brown residue distilled at ~0.2 mmHg (the vac pulls MDP2P over at 100�C). 
    The first fraction came over from 50-57�C, was water white, weighed 2.9 grams, 
    and smelled exactly like indane. The next fraction came over from 100-101�C, 
    was light yellow, smelled sweeter than the first, and weighed 9.8 grams, corresponding 
    to a whopping yield of 26%. The yield was so low because a good portion of 
    the rxn mix was lost during the water-quenching step. Also, a previous trial 
    using SnCl<sub>4</sub> rather than TiCl<sub>4</sub> gave a better yield, but 
    still not 98%. </p>

  <p>9.8 g of indane-5-carboxaldehyde was added to a 1 liter flask along with 
    75ml EtNO<sub>2</sub>. A smaller flask would have been used, but the experimenter 
    only has 50ml, 1000ml, and 5000ml heating mantles, and he didn�t feel like 
    setting up an oil bath. Stirring was started, and the heating mantle set on 
    <abbr title="Using 110V mains, hence the setting was 1/3 of full power.">40 Volts</abbr>. 
	Ammonium acetate was dried in a vacuum desiccator and ground to 
    a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. 3.0 g were added and a reflux condenser 
    attached. The color of the flask contents was initially a light yellow with 
    a hint of green. Within 10 minutes of refluxing, the color had already changed 
    to a darker, urine yellow. Over the next 4 hrs., the color progressively became 
    a darker orange/brown. At the end of 4 hrs, the excess EtNO<sub>2</sub> was 
    rotovapped off, leaving behind a dark brown oil. This oil was dissolved in 
    100ml ether, washed 3 times with 50ml water and twice with 50ml brine. A small 
    chunk of anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub> (baked Epsom salts) was added to dry any 
    last traces of water and the ether was rotovapped off.</p>

<p>Some methanol was brought to a boil, and just enough was added to the flask with the residue to make 
everything go into a dark brown solution. Approximately 10ml was used. Upon pouring the hot methanolic 
solution into a beaker with cold sides, the methanol became cloudy with what appeared to be the 
nitropropene oiling out. It eventually formed a light tan colored layer on top of the darker methanol 
layer. The beaker was placed in the freezer.</p>

<p>The contents of the beaker were filtered, the crystals put back into the beaker, fresh cold methanol was
added, the crystals were stirred for a while, and then filtered, air dried, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The final weight was 4.9 g.</p>

<h3>Preparation of indanylisopropylamine (indanylamphetamine)</h3>

  <p>Reduction of the nitrostyrene will yield the amphetamine. LAH reductions 
    were attempted but failed for various reasons, including wet THF and inactive 
    LAH. Instead of waiting for more LAH to arrive, the experimenter decided to 
    use a different method of reduction, NaBH<sub>4</sub> to reduce the double 
    bond followed by Al/Hg to reduce the nitro group. The procedure followed was 
    one earlier used in <a href="dob.html">DrGonzo's synthesis of DOB</a>.</p>

<p>3.8 grams of the nitropropene was dissolved in 100 ml MeOH in a 300 ml beaker with stirring. 
0.9 grams NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added a spatula tip full at a time over a period of about 20 minutes. </p>

  <p>Then 20 ml of 20% HCl was added. Then a spatula tip full of Hg(SCN)<sub>2</sub> 
    was added. Then aluminum foil was torn to small pieces and gradually added, 
    approximately 5 grams over 45 minutes time period. At first, little reaction 
    was noted, but as the temperature increased, the reaction accelerated.</p>

<p>At about the 1-hour point, the reaction quickly took off and became exothermic. Once it had subsided 
some, more aluminum was added (a total of about 10 grams for the whole rxn.). The solution was left to 
stir overnight. The next morning MeOH was added to dilute the nasty sludge. The MeOH was decanted away 
from the sludge and fresh MeOH added to it and swirled. This was then decanted away from the sludge and 
the process repeated once more. The sludge was discarded.</p>

<p>The MeOH extracts were combined and MeOH and water was removed at the rotovap. 300 ml 30% NaOH was 
added to the sludge and a mostly homogenous grey solution resulted (much like a MM Al/Hg reduction 
workup). This was extracted with 3x40 ml of ether. The ether layers were combined and washed twice with 
water, then extracted with 3x40 ml of 5% HCl. The aqueous layer was basified with saturated NaOH until 
pH ~ 14. This was extracted with 3x30 ml DCM. The DCM was washed with water twice, brine once, and dried 
with a piece of MgSO4. The DCM was removed at the rotovap to leave about 1 ml of amber freebase oil in 
the flask.</p>

<p>The oil was dissolved in 15 ml cold, dry ether. The ether was gassed with HCl to precipitate the 
hydrochloride salt of indanylamphetamine.</p>

<p>The product was filtered, rinsed with a small amount of ether, dried, and weighed 1.2 grams.</p>

<p>This product was then recrystallized from a minimum amount of boiling isopropanol.</p>
