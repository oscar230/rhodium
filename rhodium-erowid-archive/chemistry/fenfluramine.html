<p><b>1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propan-2-ol / fenfluramine /
asymmetric synthesis / chiral methyloxirane / nucleophilic
substitution</b></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Fenfluramine 1 is the active ingredient of a obesity drug acting
on the digestion of carbohydrates, the activity being restricted
mainly to the S enantiomer [1, 2], which can be obtained by
separation of the diastereoisomers [3] or by preferential
crystallisation of derivates, which were identified of being
conglomerates [4]. Only two syntheses of optical active
fenfluramine have been described until now: one by stereoselective
reduction of the imine derived from the ketone 2 and (R) or
(S)-alpha-phenylethylamine [5], the other starting from (S)-alanine
[6]. Two recent publications [7, 8] about the synthesis of
(S)-fenfluramine via the intermediate alcohol (S)-<b>3</b> (scheme
1) made us publish our previous results [9]. Through yeast
reduction of the ketone 2, the authors obtain the alcohol
(S)-<b>3</b>, the configuration of which they inverse in three
steps. The alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>, via the intermediate tosylate
(R)-<b>4</b>a and further the azide (S)-<b>5</b> leads to the amine
(S)-<b>6</b> after reduction and finally to the (S)-fenfluramine
(S)-<b>1</b> after reductive amination in presence of
acetaldehyde:</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine01.jpg" alt="Schema 1"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The (S)-fenfluramine is such obtained in 7 steps starting from
the alcohol (S)-<b>3</b> or in 4 steps from the alcohol
(R)-<b>3</b>.</p>

<p>In this article we present a new way of preparing the two
enantiomers of the alcohol 3, a new two step synthesis of
(S)-fenfluramine starting from the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>, a one step
synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine starting from the azide (S)-<b>5</b>,
which doesn't pass over the intermediate primary amine (S)-<b>6</b>
and finally a much faster process (3 steps) of preparing
(S)-fenfluramine starting from the alcohol (S)-<b>3</b>.</p>

<p>Results and discussion</p>

<p><i>Synthesis of 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propan-2-ol
(R)-<b>3</b></i></p>

<p>The racemic alcohol is seldom mentioned. It's one of the
metabolites of fenfluramine in the human body, secreted in urine
[10]. It can also be obtained by metabolic transformations of an
oxime by different kinds of microorganisms [11]. It was used as an
intermediate for the synthesis of a family of anorexics [12] and a
family of antispasmodic and psychotherapeutic agents [13]. It was
obtained by the reaction of methyloxirane 7 with the magnesium
compound 8, with a yield of 50%. This same reaction was described
earlier as being little regioselective [14], a fact we observed too
[9].</p>

<p>The only synthesis of the optically active alcohol 3 is the
reduction of the ketone 2 with yeast as described above. One
abtains the S enantiomer, the R enantiomer is obtained by
inversion.</p>

<p>On our part we used the condensation of the commercial [15]
methyloxirane (R)-<b>7</b>, of which many syntheses are known [16],
with the magnesium compound 8 and cuprous chloride [17, 18].</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine02.jpg" alt="Schema 2"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The yield is about 90% and the reaction very selective (purity
GC: 93%). The optical purity of the methyloxirane 7 was determined
by 1H-NMR in presence of the europium complex Eu(hfc)3 [19]. The
optical purity of the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b> was obtained by 1H-NMR
and HPLC over silica of the Mosher derivate [20]. The comparison of
these values show that the chiral centre is preserved. This
procedure has the advantage of allowing us the preparation of the
alcohol (S)-<b>3</b> with the same reaction, because the
methyloxirane (S)-<b>7</b> is also commercially available and
multiple syntheses are known [21].</p>

<p><i>Two step synthesis of the fenfluramine (S)-<b>1</b> starting
from the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b></i></p>

<p>With the goal of obtaining the simplest procedure we have
studied at first the transformation of the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>
into fenfluramine (S)- <b>1</b> in two steps via the intermediate
of the easily obtained sulfonates (R)-<b>4</b>:</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine03.jpg" alt="Schema 3"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The substitution of the mesitylate (R)-<b>4</b>b and the
tosylate (R)-<b>4</b>a with ethylamine was realised with medium
yields always between 40 and 50% in spite of the large number of
conditions tested: solvents (DMSO, DMF, ethanol, ethylamine),
different dilutions (in proportions from 1 to 5) and temparatures
from 50 to 160&deg;C (with different times of contact). With the
triflate (R)-<b>4</b>c the yield of the substitution is 60% but
under non comparable conditions (-20&deg;C in acetonitrile) because
of its higher reactivity. In all cases the non aminated, and thus
easily separated, byproducts are mainly the alkenes 9,
<b>10</b><em>Z</em> and <b>10</b><em>E</em> (<b>10</b><em>E</em>
&gt;&gt; <b>10</b><em>Z</em> &gt; 9).</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine04.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The enantiomeric purity of the amine (S)-<b>1</b> is analysed by
HPLC chromatography through silica of the camphanylated derivate
[22] and compared to the previously analysed alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>:
we have thus shown that the optical centre is conserved during the
nucleophilic substitution. One had indeed to fear that due to the
participation of the aromatic ring as neighbour group there could
be partial or complete racemisation with an phenonium ion as
intermediate. With the results obtained, which match with the
literature [23-26], one can suppose that the trifluoromethyl group
in meta position is sufficiently deactivating the aromatic ring in
order to prevent participation in the substitution. We probably
have thus in our case a pure nucleophilic SN2 substitution in
competition with an elimination reaction. We believe that this
elimination reaction is due to the simultaneous nucleophilic and
basic properties of the ethylamine.</p>

<p>Although the yields are medium, this method has the advantage of
being relatively fast because it permits to prepare fenfluramine
(S)-<b>1</b> starting from the alcohol (R)-<b>2</b> in two steps
instead of four [7, 8]. As far as we know it was never mentioned in
literature.</p>

<p><i>Synthesis of fenfluramine (S)-<b>1</b> from
2-azido-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane (S)-<b>5</b></i></p>

<p>The substitution of the mesylate (R)-<b>4</b>b by sodium azide
(scheme 4), an only slightly basic nucleophile compared to
ethylamine, forms no elimination side products. One obtains the
optically pure azide (S)-<b>5</b> with a yield of 95%.</p>

<p>The enantiomeric purity couldn't be directly analysed on the
azide (S)-<b>5</b>. Only for analytical purposes did we reduce it
into the amine (S)- <b>6</b>. Among the numerous methods for the
reductions of azides to amines mentioned in the literature [27] we
chose the catalytic hydrogenation with 5% Pd on calcium carbonate
at standard temperature and pressure [27f]. The HPLC analysis
through silica column of the champhanyl derivate [22] of the amine
(S)-<b>6</b> such obtained shows that the enantiomeric centre was
totally inverted during the substitution when compared to the
enantiomeric purity of the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine05.jpg" alt="Schema 4"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The reductive amination of the amine 6 in presence of
acetaldehyde is known for a long time [28]. It was used recently in
the works listed in the introduction [7, 8]. On our part, we
propose another synthetic route for fenfluramine (S)-<b>1</b>
starting from the azide (S)-<b>5</b> which does not go via the
primary amine (S)-<b>6</b> (Schema 5).</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine06.jpg" alt="Schema 5"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The reaction of Staudinger, reacting a stoichiometric quantity
of triethylphosphite on the azide (S)-<b>5</b> in THF at room
temperature [29], gives quantitative yields of the phosphorimide 11
in 48 hours. It's total conversion into the phosphoramide 13, by
reacting with ethyl iodide [30] could not be realised [9]. We
always obtained different mixtures of the phosphoramides 12 and 13
(referential compounds prepared from the amines 6 and 1). We also
noted that the phosphorimide 11 can't be isolated. When the solvent
is evaporated, a partly transformation into the phosphoramide 12
takes place. This transformation is completed in less then 2h by
simple heating to 100&deg;C under argon after evaporation of the
solvent. Because the phosphorimides are strongly basic compounds,
we believe that an intramolecular arrangement of the phosphorimide,
pictured in Schema 6, takes place.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine07.jpg" alt="Schema 6"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>Having the phosphoramide 12, we investigated the alkylation into
the phosphoramide 13 in DMF at room temperature [31, 32]: one
deprotonates with sodium hydride then alkylates with diethyl
sulfate. After treatment with hydrogen bromide [33], one obtains
fenfluramine 1 with a yield of 85% and a purity of 97% (GC).</p>

<p>With the goal of simplifying the reaction scheme by avoiding the
isolation of the intermediates we have again studied the
transformation 5 -&gt; 11 -&gt; 12 in DMF (Schema 7). First, we
noted that the reaction of Staudinger can be directly realised in
this solvent. Thereafter we pinned down the transformation of the
phosphorimide 11 into the phosphoramide 12 by reaction with water
[34]. One then proceeds as described above. The transformation is
thus performed without isolation of a single intermediate with a
yield of 83%.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine08.jpg" alt="Schema 7"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>HPLC analysis on silica column of the camphanyl derivate of the
amine (S)-<b>1</b> [22] shows that the optical centre is conserved
during the whole transformation.</p>

<p><i>Synthesis via the intermediate
2-chloro-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane 14</i></p>

<p>The yeast reduction of the ketone 2 gives the alcohol
(S)-<b>3</b>, of which the authors have inverted the configuration
to get the pharmacological active S enantiomer of fenfluramine [7,
8]. Independent research, using the epoxidation method of Sharpless
[9, 35] lead us too to the alcohol (S)- <b>3</b> which we tried to
convert into fenfluramine (S)-<b>1</b> using a different method.
The reaction scheme we kept uses the chloride 14 and proceeds via
two inversions of the optical centre (scheme 8). Not owning enough
alcohol (S)-<b>3</b> during the studies, we tested the principle
starting with the alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>, produced earlier, and
studied the transformation into the azide (R)-<b>5</b> (scheme 8),
the latter being able to lead to (R)-fenfluramine using different
methods, like the one outlined above:</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine09.jpg" alt="Schema 8"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>It is well known that the action of thionylchloride on an
optically active alcohol gives the corresponding chlorine derivate,
with inversion of the configuration in presence of bases and with
retention of the configuration in the other case. We have performed
the reaction with a catalytical amount of pyridine. One thus
obtains the chloride (S)-<b>14</b> with 91% yield and a purity of
91% (GC): it contains 9% of the elimination products 9,
<b>10</b><em>Z</em> and <b>10</b><em>E</em> which are not separable
by chromatography on silica.</p>

<p>The direct substitution of the chloride 14 with ethylamine with
similar conditions to those used for the mesylate (R)-<b>4</b>b
(EtNH2, DMSO, 110&deg;C, 5h30 or EtNH2 (solvent and reactant),
140&deg;C, 5h), gives mainly the elimination products. The yield of
fenfluramine is below 10%.</p>

<p>By action of sodium azide in DMSO, on the other hand, one
obtains the azide (R)-<b>5</b> with a yield of 78%, the elimination
products formed here or in the last step can be removed by
chromatography on silica. HPLC analysis on silica of the camphanyl
derivate of the amine (R)-<b>6</b> [22] obtained by catalytic
reduction of the azide (R)-<b>5</b> has confirmed the double
inversion without racemisation after comparison with the starting
alcohol (R)-<b>3</b>. Then the fenfluramine (R)-<b>1</b> is
prepared without racemisation with a 83% yield starting from the
azide (R)-<b>5</b> like detailed above.</p>

<p>This procedure with two inversions allows to transform the
alcohol 3 in the azide 5 with the same configuration in two steps
with a global yield (non optimised) of 70% and without
racemisation. It's thus preferred over the recently published one
[7, 8], which needs 5 steps for a lower global yield (55%) and in
addition features an epimerisation of 10% [8]. It's a promising way
to fenfluramine (S)-<b>1</b> starting from the alcohol (S)-
<b>3</b>.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>We described a new method allowing the preparation of the (R) or
(S)-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-propan-2-ols 3 starting from
optical active methyloxiranes and showed the importance of both
enantiomers of this alcohol for the synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine
1.<br>
 Starting with the enantiomer (R)-<b>3</b> we have described on on
hand the new 2 step synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine using the
reaction of ethylamine on the sulfonate derivate from this alcohol
and on the other hand a new synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine via the
azide (S)-<b>5</b>, made in two steps from this alcohol
(R)-<b>3</b></p>

<p>Further we have proposed a method for the preparation of
(S)-fenfluramine starting with the alcohol (S)-<b>3</b> in three
steps including a double inversion via the chloride derivate
(R)-<b>14</b></p>

<p>All reactions were realised without racemisation. They could be
applied to other analogous structures.</p>

<p><b>Experimental Part</b></p>

<p><i>General notes</i></p>

<p>The 1H NMR spectra where recorded on a Perkin Elmer R12 (60MHz)
or a Bruker AW 80 (80MHz), the 13C spectra on a Varian CFT 20
(20MHz). The chemical shifts are expressed in ppm. Unless otherwise
stated, the solvent is deutero-chloroform and the internal
reference TMS.</p>

<p>Concerning the 13C spectra: the used spectrometer did not allow
proton and fluorine decoupled spectra at the same time. The carbon
of the CF3 group (q, 1JCF=271.1 Hz) and the carbon on alpha of the
CF3 group (q, 2JCF = 32.3 Hz) are barely or not at all visible. On
the other hand, the two carbons in beta of the CF3 group are very
characteristic (q,3JCF = 3.9 Hz).</p>

<p>The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 377. The optical
rotation was measured using a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter. The
microanalyses were performed by the microanalysis service of the
INSA in Rouen.</p>

<p>The gas chromatographs were performed on a Girdel series 30
chromatograph with a flame ionisation detector. We used a column:
30% SE 30 + 1% triethanolamine on chromosorb W AW 80-100 mesh
(0.75m) (maximum usage temperature: 150&deg;C)</p>

<p>The liquid chromatographs were realised either with a Chromatem
800 HPLC apparatus of Touzart and Matignon consisting of two
Chromatem 380 pumps and a Shimadzu SPD-2A variable wavelength
detector, or with a Beckman HPLC apparatus consisting of a Beckman
110B pump and a Beckman 160 fixed wavelength detector (254 nm). We
used a Lichrosorb Si60 (5um) Merck (25 cm x 4.6 mm) column with the
following eluants:<br>
 - Hexane-THF 99.5:0.5 (2 ml/min) for the Mosher derivate of the
alcohol 3<br>
 - Hexane-isopropanol 98:2 (1 ml/min) for the camphanyl derivate of
the amine 1<br>
 - Hexane-isopropanol 90:10 (1 ml/min) for the camphanyl derivate
of the amine 6</p>

<p>The composition of the mixtures was measured with an Shimadzu
C-R1B integrator.</p>

<p>The TLCs were realised on Merck Kieselgel 254GF plates of 0.25mm
thickness. They were developed by UV (254nm) or an ethanolic
vanilline solution.</p>

<p>The silica used for purification is a new Merck Kieselgel 60
230-400 mesh. It was used as is.</p>

<p>The anhydrous THF and ether were distilled over sodium and
benzophenone right before use. The DCM and the chloroform were
distilled and filtered over basic alumina. The DMSO and the DMF
were dried over potash, distilled over barium oxide and finally
stored over molecular sieves 3A. The acetonitrile was dried and
distilled over calcium hydride. None of the presented reactions has
been optimised.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>During our studies on the asymmetric synthesis of
(S)-fenfluramine 1 [1], we investigated the following scheme, using
classical reactions and simple intermediates: alkenes, epoxides,
aminoalcohols and aziridines:</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine10.jpg" alt="Schema 1"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The asymmetric center can for example be introduced using the
alkene <b>2</b><em>E</em> using enantioselective epoxidation. This
method is subject of lots of research and the yields are constantly
improved [2]. The such obtained epoxide 3trans is then subjected to
the action of a carefully selected nucleophile in order to give the
enantiomerical pure aminoalcohol <b>4</b><em>E</em>. Hydrogenolysis
of the hydroxyl in benzylic position will give (S)-fenfluramine 1.
The aminoalcohol <b>4</b><em>E</em> and the aziridine 5trans could
also be obtained starting with the alkene <b>2</b><em>E</em> using
enantioselective hydroxyamination [3, 4] or enantioselective
aziridination. This latter method, studied by multiple teams in the
last years [5, 6] deserves being considered, because encouraging
results have been obtained recently [7]. Another alternative would
be the regiospecific reduction of the epoxide 3trans to the alcohol
(R)-<b>6</b>, of which we have shown before that it can be used as
precursor for (S)- fenfluramine in multiple processes.</p>

<p>We studied some of these possibilities starting with the alkenes
<b>2</b><em>E</em>, <b>2</b><em>Z</em> and 7. Before embarking upon
the asymmetric epoxidation, hydroxyamination and aziridination of
these alkenes, we realised the synthesis of all compounds of the
racemic series (Schema 2). The results of these preliminary
studies, which allowed us to characterise the different
intermediates and to study the limits of each reaction, are
presented in this paper. Then we studied the synthesis of
(S)-fenfluramine 1 via the intermediate aminoalcohol
(S)-<b>9</b>.</p>

<p><b>Results and discussion</b></p>

<p>Starting with the isomeric alkenes <b>2</b><em>E</em>,
<b>2</b><em>Z</em> and 7 we have investigated three parallel
reaction paths (Schema 2).</p>

<p>We have pictured the optical active products, only which are of
interest for the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine, but all
the presented reactions were realised using racemic products, with
the exception of the transformation 9 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 1.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine11.jpg" alt="Schema 2"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p><i>Preparation of the epoxides and the aminoalcohols</i></p>

<p>The alkene 7 is obtained by condensation of
3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl magnesium bromide with allyl chloride in
refluxing ether, then isomerised by the action of sodium hydroxide
in refluxing n-butanol into a mixture of the alkenes
<b>2</b><em>Z</em> and <b>2</b><em>E</em>
(<b>2</b><em>E</em>/<b>2</b><em>Z</em> : about 85/15), which are
separated by distillation. The epoxides 3trans, 3cis and 8 were
obtained by reacting 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) with the
corresponding alkene and purification by distillation.</p>

<p>According to the literature [9] it seems rather difficult to
obtain uniform ring opening of the epoxides favouring the
aminoalcohols 4 and 10. In a first attempt we reacted the epoxides
with ethylamine in ethanol during two days at 70&deg;C, hoping to
obtain and characterise the different aminoalcohols 4, 9, 10 and
11.</p>

<p>Starting with the epoxide 8 we have isolate the alcohol 9, pure
according to GC, with a yield of 97% without purification. The
regioisomer aminoalcohol 10 could not be detected.</p>

<p>The epoxide 3trans gives the aminoalcohols erythro
<b>4</b><em>E</em> and <b>11</b><em>E</em>
(<b>4</b><em>E</em>/<b>11</b><em>E</em>: 24/76) with 82% yield. The
epoxide 3cis gives the epoxides threo 4T and 11T (4T/11T: 93/7)
with 86% yield. This result was obtained by extrapolation because
the sample used contained 8% of the epoxide 3trans. The products
were separated by chromatography on silica. The configurations
could be revealed using the 1H NMR coupling constants between the
protons attached to the carbons attached to the heteroatoms and by
comparison to the aminoalcohols with related structure [10].</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine12.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The results show an inverse regioselectivity for the epoxides
3trans (<b>4</b><em>E</em>/<b>11</b><em>E</em>: 24/76) and 3cis
(4T/11T: 93/7). Using the epoxide 3cis, one obtains better
regioselectivity and further it gives the preferred product 4T.
Ring opening in alpha position to the aromatic group predominates
only in the case of the isomer 3trans where the conjugation of the
aromatic group with the neighbouring carbon, carrying the oxygen,
is possible.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine13.jpg" alt="Fig 2"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p><i>Try at the hydrogenolysis of the benzylic hydroxyl function
of the aminoalcohols 4</i></p>

<p>According to the literature [11], hydrogenation of an alcohol
group in benzylic position is easy and is performed in mild
conditions (5% Pd/C in alcohol at room temperature and standard
pressure). However beta-aminated benzylic alcohols are much harder
to hydrogenolyse: the yield is acceptable when the reaction is
performed in acidic medium [12-14].</p>

<p>Our experiments, using a mixture of the aminoalcohols
<b>4</b><em>E</em> + 4T + <b>11</b><em>E</em> + 11T and different
conditions were not successful: when using mild conditions
(ethanol-60&deg;C-24h without activator), the reactants were
isolated unchanged, and using harder conditions (acetic acid or
water-100-110&deg;C-1 to 16 h-in presence of concentrated
hydrochloric and sulfuric acid), gives general degradation. The
expected products, the amine 1 and the alcohol 6 could only be
detected in trace amounts. We believe that the trifluoromethyl
group renders the cutting in benzylic position difficult by
deactivating the aromatic ring.</p>

<p>The regioselective opening of the epoxides on one hand and the
difficulties of the hydrogenolysis of the aminoalcohols <b>4</b>
and <b>11</b> on the other hand made us study a new strategy, going
via the aziridines <b>5</b> and <b>12</b>. One notes that the 2
aminoalcohols <b>4</b><em>E</em> and <b>11</b><em>E</em> give the
same aziridine <b>5</b><em>trans</em>, likewise the aminoalcohols
<b>4</b><em>Z</em> and <b>11</b><em>Z</em> giving the aziridine
<b>5</b><em>cis</em>. A given epoxide is transformed into the
aziridine with opposite configuration (see scheme 2).</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the aziridines</i></p>

<p>One finds in the literature multiple methods giving aziridines
starting from aminoalcohols [15-19]. They all use phosphorus
compounds, with the exception of the method by Wenker [19] which
uses concentrated sulfuric acid in very hard conditions. Using
phosphorus compounds, the transformation is realised in one step in
mild conditions. One can use dibromo-triphenylphosphine in presence
of triethylamine [15], triphenylphosphine in presence of
triethylamine and carbon tetrachloride [16], tretraiodophoshporus
[17] and (diethoxy triphenyl)phosphorane [18]. In two cases [15,
18], the conservation of the chiral centres by Walden inversion has
clearly been established.</p>

<p>The method we retained used the simplest and most easily
accessed reagents: triphenylphosphine, triethylamine and carbon
tetrachloride [16]. Starting with the aminoalcohols <b>4</b>,
<b>11</b> and <b>9</b> we thus obtained the aziridines
<b>5</b><em>cis</em>, <b>5</b><em>trans</em> and <b>12</b>, which
have never been described before. The yields after purification by
distillation are between 70 and 75%.</p>

<p>For the preparation of the aziridine <b>12</b> we have also
carried out multiple experiments with triethyl phosphite. The yield
is a bit less (60%). This variation of the original method [16] has
never been described as far as we know.</p>

<p>Going via these aziridines has the following advantages: it is
unnecessary to separate the aminoalcohols <b>4</b> and <b>11</b>,
and the useless aminoalcohol <b>11</b> is such recycled in the
reaction without any additional work. It is also a quick method for
the valorisation of the aminoalcohol <b>9</b>. Further, it is no
longer necessary to bother with the regioselectivity of the
nucleophilic attack on the epoxide, which allows the usage of the
simplest method for the preparation of the aminoalcohols:
ethylamine in ethanol.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of the aziridines</i></p>

<p>It remained to work out the transformation of the aziridines
<b>5</b> and <b>12</b> into fenfluramine <b>1</b>. The aziridines
<b>5</b> can lead to the amines <b>1</b> and <b>13</b>, the
aziridine <b>12</b> to the amines <b>1</b> and <b>14</b> [20]
(scheme 3).</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine14.jpg"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>In order to realise the ring opening of the aziridines <b>5</b>
and <b>12</b> into fenfluramine <b>1</b>, we used catalytic
hydrogenation [11], peculiar to open the ring at the less
substituted side, in the case of the aziridine <b>12</b>, and
benzylic hydrogenolysis in the case of the aziridines <b>5</b>. The
experiments were performed in ethanol at standard temperature and
pressure (table I).</p>

<sup>*</sup> 3<em>trans</em>-3<em>cis</em> : 83/16 d'apr&egrave;s
la RMN <sup>1</sup>H. <br>
<br>


<p>We noted that in all three cases the reaction is perfectly
regioselective, the amines <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> could not be
detected. The only observed side reaction is the formation of the
diethylamine <b>15</b>, especially when using palladium on calcium
carbonate. We believe that, on contact with the catalyst, the
ethanol is dehydrogenated into acetaldehyde [21] which gives the
diethylamine by amination of the amine <b>1</b> formed during the
reduction. Provided that the regioselectivity is preserved, the
replacement of ethanol by another solvent should allow to obtain
the pure amine <b>1</b>.</p>

<p>Usage of palladium on carbon minimises the formation of
diethylamine 15 in the case of the aziridines
<b>5</b><em>trans</em> and <b>12</b>. On the other hand, the
aziridine <b>5</b><em>cis</em> is less reactive and needs a
reaction time of <b>3</b> days instead of one. Therefore the
byproduct is present in non deniable amounts.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of the epoxides</i></p>

<p>The epoxide <b>3</b> can lead to the alcohols <b>6</b> and
<b>16</b> and the epoxide to the alcohols <b>6</b> and
<b>17</b>.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine15.jpg" alt="Schema 4"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>Only the alcohol <b>6</b> is a potential precursor of the
fenfluramine <b>1</b>.</p>

<p>Given the satisfying results obtained using the aziridines, we
realised the same type of study (table II).</p>

<p>The alcohol <b>16</b> was never detected. In the case of the
epoxide <b>8</b>, the alcohol <b>17</b>, formed when using
palladium on carbon, disappears when replacing the latter by
palladium on calcium carbonate.</p>

<p>Among the byproducts one finds the deoxygenated product
<b>18</b>, when using palladium on carbon and the ketone <b>19</b>,
formed by dehydrogenation of the alcohol <b>6</b> on contact with
the catalyst [21], particularly when using palladium on calcium
carbonate.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine16.jpg" alt="Fig 3"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>Thus, like in the case of the aziridines, we were able to obtain
a regioselective ring opening of the epoxides <b>3</b> and <b>8</b>
by hydrogenolysis of the bond in benzylic position using palladium
on carbon in the case of the epoxide <b>3</b> and by hydrogenation
of the ring on the less substituted side by palladium on calcium
carbonate in the case of the epoxide <b>8</b>.</p>

<p><i>Asymmetric synthesis of the (S)-fenfluramine</i></p>

<p>From a stereochemical viewpoint, one could contemplate to access
the many proposed precursors of the amine <b>1</b> (epoxide,
aminoalcohol or aziridine) by totally different reactions than
those we have described. Thus the validity of our reaction scheme
for the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-fenfluramine has been shown
starting with the aminoalcohol (S)-9. The latter was prepared using
the epoxyalcohol (1R,2R)-20, which in turn was obtained by
asymmetric epoxidation of the corresponding allyl alcohol according
to the method of Sharpless and transformed into fenfluramine via
the intermediate aziridine (R)-12 (schema) using the technique
described above.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="pictures/fenfluramine17.jpg" alt="Schema 5"></center>

<br>
<br>


<p>The comparison of the enantiomeric excesses of the epoxyalcohol
<b>20</b> and the fenfluramine (S)-1 shows that there is no
racemisation during the different reactions, notably during the
cyclisation into aziridine. The detailed results of these
transformations will be published later [22].</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>Regarding synthesis, we have prepared and characterised a number
of intermediates: racemic epoxides, aminoalcohols and aziridines,
and shown possible synthetic pathways to fenfluramine <b>1</b>
using simple methods starting with the alkenes <b>2</b><em>Z</em>,
<b>2</b><em>E</em> and <b>7</b>.</p>

<p>Regarding stereochemistry, we have shown the validity of our
reaction scheme to prepare (S)-fenfluramine starting with the
aminoalcohol (S)-9. The enantioselective epoxidation,
hydroxyamination and aziridination reactions can now be
approached.</p>

<p>From a general point of view, given the large applicability of
the presented reactions, the regiospecificity of the hydrogenation
reactions and the hydrogenolysis, we believe that this work gives
new perspectives for the synthesis of 2-(alkylamino)-1-arylpropanes
and 1-arylpropane-2-ols which are potential precursors.</p>

<p><b>Experimental part</b></p>

<p><i>General indications</i></p>

<p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were recorded on an Perkin Elmer R
12 (60 Mhz) or a Bruker AW 80 (80 MHz), the <sup>13</sup>C NMR
spectra on a Varian CFT 20 (20 MHz). The chemical shifts are
expressed in ppm. Unless otherwise noted, the solvent is
deuterochloroform and the internal reference is TMS.</p>

<p>Concerning the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra: the used spectrometer
did not allow the recording of fluorine and proton decoupled
spectra at the same time. The carbon of the CF<sub>3</sub> group
(q, 2JCF=271.7 Hz) and the carbon on alpha to the CF<sub>3</sub>
group (q, 2JCF=32.3 Hz) are only hardly or not at all visible. They
were never indicated. On the other hand, the <b>2</b> carbons beta
to the CF<sub>3</sub> group are very characteristic (q, 3JCF=3.9
Hz).</p>

<p>The IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer 377. The
melting points were measured using a melting point microscope
Reichert Jung. The microanalyses were performed by the common
microanalysis service of the INSA of Rouen.</p>

<p>The gas chromatographs were realised with a Girdel series 30
chromatograph with a flame ionisation detector. The used columns
are:<br>
Column A: 30% SE 30 + 1% triethanolamine on chromosorb W AW 80-100
mesh (0.75 m) (maximum usage temperature: 150&deg;C)<br>
Column B: 2.5% SE 30 + 2.5% XE 60 on chromosorb W AW 80-100 mesh
(1.50 m)<br>
Column C: 5% carbowax 20M on chromosorb W AW 100-120 mesh (1.40
m)<br>

g; 230 mmol) in ether (30 ml) is then added over 45 min. The
reaction is refluxed for 2h then cooled and poured on ice (65g).
The flask is rinsed with water (20 ml). The phases are separated
and the aqueous phase extracted with ether (45 ml). The combined
organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and
evaporated. After distillation (bp = 54-54&deg;C/13-14 mm Hg), the
alkene <b>7</b> (33.8 g; 81% yield) is obtained.<br>
