<h3>Abstract</h3>

Two novel and practical syntheses of 3-hydroxythiophenol are achieved using readily available and inexpensive starting materials. An overall cost comparison of these syntheses is also given.</p>

  <p>Hydroxythiophenols are important starting materials for a variety 
    of medicinal and heterocyclic compounds.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 
    The 3-hydroxythiophenol moiety, in particular, is present in the osteoporosis 
    drug, raloxifene.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>2a</sup></a> 
    An early synthesis of 3-hydroxythiophenol (3-HTP) involved hydrolysis of monothioresorcinol-<em>O</em>-carboxylic 
    acid ethyl ester which was made from 3-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid sodium 
    salt in three steps.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>  A later procedure 
    included reaction of the diazonium salt of 3-aminophenol with aqueous potassium 
    ethyl xanthate at 70&deg;C.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>  However, diazonium 
    xanthates (ArN = NSCSOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) can be explosive and violent 
    reactions have been reported.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>  The 3-hydroxythiophenol 
    was also obtained when 3-methoxyphenyl methyl sulfide was treated with two 
    equivalents of sodium diethylamide and hexamethylphosphoric triamide in refluxing 
    xylene.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> Reaction of hydrogen sulfide 
    with 3-chlorophenol at high temperature (500-600&deg;C) has also been reported 
    to yield 3-hydroxythiophenol.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>  Recently, 
    we had a need to produce commercial quantities of 3-HTP in high purity. These 
    existing literature preparations are unsatisfactory as a viable basis for 
    a scaleable process because of potential safety hazards or because the required 
    starting materials are not commercially available.</p>

<p>At the outset, we envisioned two approaches to investigate (Scheme [<b>1</b>]). The first approach is to start from a precursor having a phenolic hydroxyl functionality already in place and a second functional group that can be readily transformed into an aryl thiol group. A survey of the literature revealed two potential thiol-forming functional groups, namely, arylamines and aryl halides. Thearyl­amines can be converted to the corresponding aryl thiols via their diazonium salts. Nucleophilic displacement of the diazonium group with a sulfur nucleophile readily yields the thiol.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>  The synthetic utilities of these reactions, 
however, are limited only to small-scale runs because of explosion risks.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>  Aryl halides, on the other hand, can be converted to aryl thiols via reaction of their Grignard reagents with sulfur.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>  To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports in the literature on any potential explosion risks. Thus, halogenated phenols such as 3-bromophenol are "ideal" hydroxyl containing precursors for this purpose. The second approach is to start from a precursor containing an aryl thiol group and a second functional group that can be converted readily to a phenolic hydroxyl function. Since phenols can be readily made from aromatic amines via their diazonium salts, 3-aminothiophenol is an "ideal" thiol-containing precursor to 3-hydroxythiophenol. We wish to report herein two practical syntheses of 3-hydroxythiophenol based on the two aforementioned approaches.</p>

  
  <h3>The Grignard Reaction Approach</h3>
  <p>We investigated this approach first because of its high probability 
    of success in the near term (Scheme [<b>2</b>]). 
	3-Bromophenol (<strong><em>1</em></strong>) was first protected as the trimethylsilyl 
    ether <strong><em>2</em></strong> in high yield prior to the Grignard reaction. 
    The initiation went very smoothly in the temperature range of 25-30&deg;C in 
    THF. Some decomposition of the Grignard reagent was observed, especially at 
    elevated temperatures.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>  The internal 
    temperature was thus kept below 55&deg;C during the bromide addition to minimize 
    decomposition. Inverse addition of the Grignard reagent to a sulfur slurry 
    in THF at 0-15&deg;C led to the formation of the ArSMgBr intermediate. Quenching 
    with dilute aqueous HCl removed the TMS protective group to afford the desired 
    3-hydroxythiolphenol. Fractional vacuum distillation yielded the desired compound 
    in &gt;99% purity (GC).</p>

<div class="pic left">
<img src="pictures/m028_s2.gif">
</div>
	
  <p>The choice of the protective groups is critical to the reaction. 
    Initially we explored the tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group, a typical hydroxy 
    protective group for Grignard reaction. While the Grignard reaction went very 
    smoothly in high yield, the subsequent reaction with sulfur produced low and 
    variable yields (0-25%) of the desired hydroxy­thiophenol. Examination of 
    the major by-product revealed the reactive nature of the SH group toward dihydropyran, 
    formed in the HCl quenching/de-protection step. A silyl protective group is 
    advantageous in this particular case because of the low reactivity of TMSOH 
    toward the SH group. </p>

  <p>The Grignard route to 3-hydroxythiophenol was scaled up in a 
    production plant. A total of 11 batches (ca. 100 kg/batch) were produced in 
    consistent yields and purity. This route supplied us material for the near 
    term, however, it is not cost-effective as a production process. The key raw 
    material 3-bromophenol was expensive and suffered from poor weight throughput 
    due to replacement of the bromine atom with mercaptan group. Furthermore, 
    multiple labor-intensive extractive work-up and distillation steps were required. 
    We thus explored the second approach as elucidated earlier.</p>

  <h3>The Diazonium Salt Approach </h3>

  <div class="pic right">
  <img src="pictures/m028_s3.gif">
  </div>

  <p>The success of this approach is hinged on the protection of 
    the thiol group prior to the diazonium salt formation, to avoid its potentially 
    hazardous reaction with the diazonium salt. Since cost reduction was the main 
    driver for the alternate process, the selected protective group(s) had to 
    meet the requirements of good atom economy and low cost. Internal protection 
    via disulfide formation best meets these requirements.</p> 

<p>As shown in Schemes [<b>3</b>], 3-aminothiophenol (<strong><em>3</em></strong>) was first internally protected as the disulfide <strong><em>4</em></strong> in 
near quantitative yield via oxidation by methyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The disulfide <em>4</em> was then doubly diazotized followed by hydrolysis to afford the 3-hydroxy­phenyldisulfide <strong><em>5</em></strong>.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a> Reduction of <strong><em>5</em></strong> with Zinc/sulfuric acid then led to the formation of the desired 3-hydroxythiophenol.</p>

  <div class="pic left">
  <img src="pictures/m028_s4.gif">
  </div>

  <p>The 3-aminothiophenol (<strong><em>3</em></strong>) was initially 
    purchased from commercial sources in small quantities. Its high cost, however, 
    would prevent its use on commercial scale as the key starting material. Therefore, 
    a cost-effective in-house synthesis of <strong><em>3</em></strong> was developed 
    from 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (<strong><em>6</em></strong>), an inexpensive 
    commercial material. At first, we explored simultaneous reductions of both 
    the nitro and sulfonyl chloride groups under various conditions. Using zinc/HCl 
    in aqueous ethanol at reflux, 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (<strong><em>6</em></strong>) 
    was reduced to 3-aminophenyl disulfide (<strong><em>4</em></strong>) as its hydrochloride 
    salt in low yields. A trace amount of 3-aminophenyl sulfonic acid ethyl ester 
    was detected by GCMS. The majority of the product appeared to be metanilic 
    acid, a compound from the hydrolysis of the sulfonyl chloride under the reaction 
    conditions. Attempts to minimize the hydrolysis using 70% sulfuric acid did 
    not give much improvement in yield. A stepwise approach was then pursued (Scheme 
    [<b>4</b>] ). Reduction of the sulfonyl chloride 
    with hydriodic acid afforded 3-nitrophenyl disulfide (<strong><em>7</em></strong>) 
    in better than 95% yields, as reported in the literature.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> 
    The nitro group was then reduced to NH<sub>2</sub> using Fe in ethanolic HCl. 
    Initially, the reduction was carried out under reflux conditions. Under these 
    conditions, both the nitro and disulfide linkage were reduced yielding the 
    desired 3-aminothiophenol (<strong><em>3</em></strong>) in moderate yields. <em>To 
    our pleasant surprise, the reduction became highly selective at lower temperatures 
    (25-35&deg;C) to give 3-aminophenyl disulfide (</em>4<em>) 
    directly in near quantitative yield which was conveniently isolated as the 
    sulfate salt</em>. The sulfate was diazotized directly with no further purification 
    and then converted directly to 3-HTP as described previously. </p>
  
  <p>In summary, we have developed practical and scaleable syntheses 
    of 3-hydroxythiophenol from either 3-bromophenol via the Grignard reagent 
    or 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride via the diazonium intermediate. While both 
    routes produce 3-hydroxythiophenol in good yields and high purity, the latter 
    approach requires only inexpensive raw materials and provides convenient isolation 
    of solid intermediates, thus offering major cost advantages. </p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>3-Bromophenyl Trimethylsilyl Ether (2)</h4>
  <p>A dry, nitrogen purged 5 L 3-necked round-bottomed flask was 
    equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel 
    and a Claisen adapter through which were fitted a reflux condenser and a thermocouple. 
    To this flask was added THF (2340 mL), pyridine (294.5 mL, 3.6 mol) and 3-bromophenol 
    (486.8 g, 2.8 mol) to obtain a homogeneous soln. To this soln was then added 
    carefully, via the addition funnel, trimethylchlorosilane (464.8 mL, 3.6 mol) 
    under nitrogen, with stirring in ca. 45 min while maintaining pot temperature 
    below 50&deg;C. The resultant white slurry was stirred at ambient temperature 
    until the reaction was complete as shown by GC. The solids were removed by 
    vacuum filtration using a Buchner funnel and washed with THF (2x200 mL). 
    The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product 
    as a liquid. The crude product was purified by distillation to afford 3-trimethylsiloxylbromobenzene 
    (642 g, 94%) as a clear liquid; bp 77&deg;C/0.4 mmHg. </p>

<h4>3-Trimethylsiloxylphenylmagnesium Bromide</h4>

  <p>A dry, nitrogen purged 5 L 3-necked round-bottomed flask was 
    equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel 
    and a Claisen adapter through which were fitted a reflux condenser and a thermocouple. 
    The flask was charged with magnesium turnings (55.1 g, 2.26 mol), then heated 
    to 110&deg;C under nitrogen and cooled slowly to ca. 85&deg;C at which point, iodine 
    (400 mg) was quickly introduced. The flask was further cooled to below 40&deg;C 
and THF (1224 mL) was added. To the stirred Mg/THF suspension, a portion 
    (40 mL) of 3-trimethylsiloxylbromobenzene (500 g, 386 mL, 2.04 mol) was added 
    via the addition funnel. The pot temperature was then raised to 36&deg;C and 
    the Grignard reaction initiated. The remaining bromide was then added carefully 
    so that the reaction could be kept at 46-50&deg;C. The addition funnel was rinsed 
    with THF (117 mL) and the rinse soln was added to the reaction mixture. After 
    the reaction was complete as shown by GC, an aliquot of the Grignard reagent 
    was titrated by a literature procedure (1.55 mol, 76% yield).<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>
    The Grignard soln was held at 40&deg;C before use to avoid crystallization.</p>
	
<h4>3-Hydroxythiophenol</h4>

  <p>A dry, nitrogen purged 12 L, 4-necked jacketed flask equipped 
    with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a reflux 
    condenser and a thermocouple was charged with sulfur powder (52.1 g, 1.6 mol) 
    and THF (585 mL). The suspension was cooled to 5&deg;C with stirring. To this 
    mixture was then carefully added the above Grignard reagent via a Teflon transfer 
    tube by applying nitrogen pressure while maintaining the reaction temperature 
    below 15&deg;C. The flask containing the Grignard reagent was rinsed with THF 
    (2x234 mL) and the rinse solns were also added to the reaction mixture. 
    The reaction was warmed to r.t. and stirred until a negative Gilman’s test<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> 
	is obtained. To the resultant mixture 
    was then added 10% aq HCl (1158 g) in one portion. The reaction mixture was 
    stirred for one additional hour while cooling to r.t. The bottom aq layer 
    was drained off and the top THF layer was treated with a soln of KOH (508 
    g) and Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (212.7 g) in H<sub>2</sub>O 
    (1740 mL) at reflux for 2 h. The THF layer was separated and concentrated 
    under reduced pressure. The residue was combined with the aq layer and the 
    combined aq phase was extracted with <em>t</em>-butyl methyl 
    ether (2x1170 mL). The aq phase was acidified to pH 1 with concd HCl, and 
    extracted with <em>t</em>-butyl methyl ether three times (1560, 
    1170, and 780 mL respectively). The combined organic layer was washed with 
    brine (780 mL). Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure while keeping 
    the water bath temperature &lt;30°C afforded 181.6 g of the crude product. 
    The crude was purified by fractional vacuum distillation using a Vigreux column 
    to provide 3-hydroxythiophenol (135.7 g, 53%) as a colorless liquid; bp 92°C/0.075 mmHg.</p>

<h4>Bis(3-nitrophenyl) Disulfide (7)</h4>

  <p>This procedure was adapted from Sheppard<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> 
    with some modifications. A 500-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask was equipped 
    with a mechanical stirrer, a thermal couple and an addition funnel. The flask 
    was charged with 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (<em>6</em>) 
    (50 g, 0.226 mol) followed by a rapid addition of hydriodic acid (47-49%, 
    306.7 g, 1.15 mol) in ca. 2 min while stirring. The addition funnel was replaced 
    by a condenser. The reaction temperature slowly rose to 41&deg;C in ca. 10 min 
    and the mixture turned purple. The reaction was stirred at r.t. for 3 h followed 
    by addition of an aq sodium bisulfite soln (73.4 g in 170 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O). 
    The reaction mixture turned yellow. The precipitate was collected by vacuum 
    filtration, washed with H<sub>2</sub>O (2x50 mL) and dried by suction. The 
    solid was further dried in a vacuum oven at 50&deg;C for 17 h to obtain 35.5 
    g of the crude product (102%). The crude was of sufficient purity and used 
    for the next step without further purification. An analytical sample was obtained 
    by recrystallization in acetone; mp 79-80&deg;C (lit.<a href="3-hydroxythiophenol.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> 
    82-83&deg;C).</p>

<h4>3-Aminothiophenol (3)</h4>

  <p>In a 100-mL, 3-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser 
    and a mechanical stirrer were placed 3-nitrophenyl disulfide (6.2 g, 20 mmol), 
    iron powder (6.8 g, 122 mol) and 50% wt. aq EtOH (20 g). The mixture was stirred 
    followed by the addition of concd HCl (0.4 mL) via a syringe. The resultant 
    mixture was heated at reflux for 3 h, turned rusty and later, brown. It was 
    then vacuum filtered while hot and the iron powder was returned to reaction 
    flask and refluxed in 95% EtOH (20 mL) for 10 min and filtered hot. This step 
    was repeated one more time. The combined filtrates was evaporated under reduced 
    pressure to obtain the crude 3-aminothiophenol (3.7 g, 73%) as a liquid. The 
    crude was used without further purification. It was identified by retention 
    time comparison with a commercial sample from Aldrich. </p>
	
<h4>3-[(3-Aminophenyl)disulfanyl]aniline (4) (Method A)</h4>
	
  <p>To a mixture of 3-nitrophenyl disulfide (25 g, 0.081 mol), iron 
    powder (27.2 g, 0.488 mol) and 50% wt. aq EtOH (80 mL) in a 250-mL, round-bottomed 
    flask was carefully added a mixture of concd HCl (17.6 g, 0.178 mol) and 50% 
    wt. aq EtOH (34 mL) via an addition funnel under mechanical stirring and nitrogen 
    in a period of 30 min. The reaction temperature was kept between 20-35&deg;C 
    with an ice-water bath until the completion of the reaction. The reaction 
    mixture was then diluted with 95% EtOH (34 mL) and stirred for an additional 
    20 min. The dark brown mixture was then vacuum-filtered, rinsed with 95% EtOH 
    (2x34 mL) and discarded. The filtrate was then poured into 6 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
    (34 mL) under stirring to afford a white slurry which was filtered under vacuum 
    and washed with H<sub>2</sub>O (50 mL). The crude product was dried in a vacuum 
    oven at 50&deg;C with N<sub>2</sub> purge to a constant weight of 29.8 g (106%). 
  </p>

  <p>The crude was used for next step without further purification.</p>
  
<h4>3-[(3-Aminophenyl)disulfanyl]aniline (4) (Method B)</h4>
  
  <p>A mixture of 3-aminothiophenol (<em>3</em>) (4.8g, 38.3 mmol) and methyl sulfoxide (3.0 g, 38.3 mmol) was heated at 80-90&deg;C 
in an oil bath for 4 h. GC analyses showed a clean conversion to 3-aminophenyl 
    disulfide. The hot reaction mixture was then rapidly poured into a 35% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
    soln (28 mL) in a beaker with stirring to obtain 3-aminophenyl disulfide sulfate 
    as a white suspension which can be used for a diazonium reaction directly.</p>
  
<h4>3-[(3-Hydroxyphenyl)disulfanyl]phenol (5)</h4>
  
  <p>3-Aminophenyl disulfide sulfate (42 g, 0.123 mol) was dissolved 
    in concd H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (330 g) in a 600-mL beaker (beaker 1). 
    Sodium nitrite powder (17.6 g, 0.255 mol) was then added to the beaker in 
    several small portions so that the reaction temperature could be kept below 
    20&deg;C with an ice-water bath. The viscous liquid was mechanically stirred 
    for additional 10 min after completion of addition and was kept cold. </p>
  <p>In a separate 1000-mL beaker (beaker 2) was placed crushed ice 
    (300 g) and the beaker was immersed in an ice-water bath. To this beaker was 
    then carefully poured the above diazonium soln in beaker 1 while the internal 
    temperature was maintained below 15&deg;C. The beaker 1 was washed with ice (2x15 g) 
	and the resultant ice-water mixture was transferred into beaker 2. 
    The beaker 2 was stirred for 10 additional min. Sulfamic acid (3.0 g) crystals 
    were then added, the resultant mixture was stirred for additional 20 min and 
    kept cold.</p>
	
  <p>A 3000-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical 
    stirrer, an addition funnel and a Claisen adapter through which were fitted 
    a thermal couple and a condenser. In the flask were placed H<sub>2</sub>O 
    (300 g), concd H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (300 g) and the resultant soln 
    were heated to reflux using a heating mantle. The diazonium salt soln was 
    then added to the refluxing sulfuric acid at such rate that the internal temperature 
    could be kept between 120-124&deg;C. Heating was removed shortly after the completion 
    of addition and the flask was cooled to ca. 50&deg;C with an ice-water bath followed 
    by addition of toluene (600 mL). The mixture was heated at 50-70&deg;C for 30 
    min under vigorous stirring and allowed to cool to r.t. The mixture was then 
    transferred to a 2 L separatory funnel to separate the organic layer (the 
    black tar was discarded). The aq layer was returned to the flask and extracted 
    with toluene (2 × 600 mL). The combined toluene layer was dried over anhyd 
    Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated under reduced pressure to afford 
    the crude 3-hydroxyphenyl di­sulfide (22.5 g, 75% yield) as a semi-solid. 
    The crude was used without purification. The compound was identified by GCMS 
    and HPLC by comparing with an authentic sample prepared by oxidation of 3-hydroxythiophenol 
    with DMSO. </p>

<h4>3-Hydroxythiophenol</h4>
  
  <p>The crude 3-hydroxyphenyl disulfide (66.3 g, 0.265 mol) was dissolved in 
    anhyd EtOH (200 mL) in a 1 L, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with 
    a mechanical stirrer and a thermal couple. To the flask was then added 10% 
    wt. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (300 g, 0.306 mol) to obtain a yellowish suspension. 
    Zinc dust (17.3 g, 0.265 mol) was then added to the flask in several portions. 
    The internal temperature was kept at 25-40&deg;C for 1 h after the addition. 
    The mixture was then heated at reflux to destroy any residual visible zinc 
    particles. EtOH was stripped off at reduced pressure (230 mL liquid was collected). 
    The residue was extracted with toluene (3x250 mL). The combined toluene 
    layers were washed with brine (200 mL) and dried over anhyd Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. 
    Removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator afforded crude 3-hydroxythiophenol 
    as a liquid. It was purified by fractional vacuum distillation to yield pure 
    3-hydroxythiophenol (34.7 g, 54%) as a colorless liquid (92°C/0.075 mmHg). 
    It was shown identical to that made via the Grignard route by <sup>1</sup>H 
    NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, IR and GCMS.</p>
