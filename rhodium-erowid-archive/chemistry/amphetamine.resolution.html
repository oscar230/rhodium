<h4>Methamphetamine Optical Resolution by Distillation After Partial Diastereoisomeric Salt Formation</h4>

<p>Solvent-free optical resolution of N-methylamphetamine was developed by distillation after partial diastereoisomeric salt formation.</p>

<p>From the 18 chiral acids tested by this method, five provide by this method resolution: O,O'-dibenzoyltartaric acid, O,O'-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, 6-methoxy-<em>alpha</em>-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid (Naproxen), the cis-permetrinic acid, and the 2-phenoxypropionic acid. Among them the O,O'-dibenzoyltartaric acid in water-free form provided the more effective resolution. The efficiency of this resolution S = 0.74 is in the range of the industrial-scale resolutions and not worse than the efficiency achieved by optical resolution via fractional crystallization.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
		
		<p>Dutch Resolution is the term given to the use of mixtures 
          (families) of resolving agents in classical resolutions. In this status 
          report an overview is given of the latest results and new (possible) 
          families of resolving agents are introduced. The concept of families 
          is discussed as well as the factors that come into play on use of families. 
          Practical aspects of Dutch Resolution in particular and resolutions 
          in general are discussed. </p>

<h3>Resolution of racemic Amphetamine</h3>

<p>My invention relates to a novel method for the separation of the optically active isomers of amphetamine and it compromises methods wherein the laevo
and dextro isomers, in the form of their neutral salts with d-tartaric acid, are separated by the fractional crystallisation from an alcohol solution of
such salts, the neutral d-tartrate of the laevo amine being obtained as a crystalline material, and it more particularly relates to the separation of the
laevo-isomer, in the form of its neutral salt with d-tartaric acid, and the recovery of the laevo amine, as free base, from such neutral salt; all as more
fully hereinafter set forth and as claimed.</p>

<p>It is known in the art (Ber. D. Chem. Gesell. (1932) p664) that d-amphetamine d-bitartrate may be obtained as a crystalline acid tartrate, from the
racemic (- methylphenethylamine, by reacting the racemic amine with sufficient d-tartaric acid to form a mixture of the tartrates of the d- and l- amine
and then fractionally crystallising the bitartrate of the d-amine from an alcohol solution of the mixture of acid tartrates so obtained. To obtain the
d-amine as the free base, the acid tartrate may be decomposed with caustic alkali and the free base recovered by distillation in vacuo. By using l-tartaric
acid in such method, the l-amphetamine l-bitartrate is obtained as a crystalline material by fractional crystallisation. This acid tartrate may likewise
be decomposed with alkali to obtain the l-amine as a free base.</p>

<p>That is, either dextro or laevo -amphetamine have been previously obtained from the racemic form by certain known prior methods. But in such prior
methods, the separation of the desired isomer is effected by the fractional crystallisation of acid tartrates. And in those methods, d-tartaric acid is
used to obtain the dextro amine and l-tartaric acid to prepare the laevo amine. However while those processes are operable chemically, they have serious
disadvantages, particularly with regard to the separation of l-amphetamine by means of d-tartaric acid, in that while d-tartaric acid is readily available
and comparatively cheap, l-tartaric acid at the present time is both difficult to obtain and expensive in pure form (d tartaric acid comes from fruit,
l-tartaric acid is 'unnatural'). Thus by the method outlined above d-amphetamine may be readily and cheaply prepared while the laevo form can only be
obtained at great expense.</p>

<p>I have discovered a method whereby both optically active forms of amphetamine, and especially the laevo form may be prepared by the use of
d-tartaric acid alone. This novel method greatly simplifies the process and makes the therapeutically useful isomers readily available.</p>

<p>Broadly, the method according to this invention comprises the separation of l-amphetamine from dl-amphetamine by treatment with d-tartaric acid for the
production of a mixture of neutral d-tartrates and crystallisation from a solution, it having been found that l-amphetamine may be readily separated
by crystallisation from a solution of the neutral d-tartrates.</p>

<p>The method according to this invention may be applied to, for example, racemic amphetamine, or to any mixture of the optically active isomers
thereof in which the laevo form is present in amount not substantially less than the dextro form.</p>

<p>Again, the method according to this invention is applicable to mixtures rich in the laevo form, such as result from initial separation of the dextro
form by methods heretofore known, as, for example, by crystallisation from a solution of a mixture of acid d-tartrates.</p>

<p>Where it is desired to effect separation of the laevo form from a mixture a mixture rich in the dextro form, it will usually be necessary to first
effect separation of a part of the dextro form by methods heretofore known and then to apply the method in accordance with this invention to the
remaining mixture.</p>

<p>As will be appreciated, the method in accordance with this invention, while primarily of the greatest advantage for effecting separation of
l-(-methylphenethylamine, provides also procedure for the separation of d-amphetamine.</p>

<p>As more specifically illustrative of the method in accordance with this invention for the separation of the l-enantiomorph form, for example, racemic
amphetamine, by the use of d-tartaric acid alone and with separation also of d-amphetamine, the following procedure may be employed and will be found to
be efficient.</p>

<p>Two mols, for example, 270 grams, of racemic amphetamine base are reacted with one mol (150 grams) of d-tartaric acid, thereby forming a
dl-amphetamine d-tartrate, a neutral salt. The neutral salt thus obtained is fully dissolved by the addition of sufficient, say about 1 litre,
of absolute ethanol, and heating to about boiling point. The solution is then allowed to cool to room temperature with occasional stirring to effect
crystallisation. The crystals are filtered off and will be found to contain a preponderance of the laevo enantiomorph. On recrystallisation the
preponderance of the l-enantiomorph is increased and the process is repeated until no further change in optical rotation is effected and a
reading of [(]20(D = -6.5 is obtained in a concentration of 8 grams per 100 cc of aqueous solution. The product thus obtained is l-amphetamine d-tartrate.
The residual solid in the mother liquors is repeatedly and systematically crystallised, yielding a further fraction of l-amphetamine d-tartrate which may
be purified by recrystallization. d-amphetamine may be readily recovered from the mother liquors by the addition of tartaric acid thereto for the
formation of acid tartrates and separation of d-amphetamine d-bitartrate by crystallisation.</p>

<p>The free base of either optically active isomer may be obtained by addition to the d-tartrate in the case of the laevo isomer and the d-bitartrate in
the case of the dextro isomer of alkali in excess, as for example, by the addition of an aqueous solution of caustic soda, which will cause the base
to separate as an oil which may be recovered and purified by any well known procedure.</p>

<p>As a further example, one mol of racemic amphetamine base is reacted with 1.2 mols of tartaric acid and the resulting bitartrate is dissolved in, for
example, 80% ethanol, with heating almost to the boiling point. The solution is then allowed to cool to about 60(C and filtered hot. Repeated
crystallisation is then carried out until crystals having an optical rotation [(]20(D = +30.8 are obtained in a concentration of 8 grams per 100cc of
aqueous solution. The product thus obtained is pure d-amphetamine d-bitartrate. The residual solid in the mother liquors is repeatedly and systematically
crystallised, yielding a further fraction of d-amphetamine d-bitartrate which may be purified by recrystallisation.</p>

<p>The residual solid in the mother liquors now remaining comprises a preponderance of l-amphetamine d-bitartrate, which may now be separated by effecting
neutralisation of the excess of d-tartaric acid present with production of neutral tartrates and effecting separation of the l-amphetamine d-tartrate by crystallisation.</p>

<p>Neutralisation of the excess tartaric acid may be effected where, as in the case of the example above, the mother liquors comprise alcoholic solutions
by dividing the total volume of the mother liquors into equal parts, removing, for example, by evaporation, the alcohol from one part, adding
excess alkali, liberating the free base, which, as has been indicated, separates as an oil, separating and drying the free base with for example,
caustic potash and then adding the free base to the other portion of the mother liquors with heating to forma solution. Such procedure will result in
the formation of a neutral d-tartrate solution. From the solution so formed l-amphetamine d-tartrate may be separated by repeated
crystallisation and the free base may be recovered as described above.</p>

<p>Following the procedure in accordance with this invention, other salts of the optically active isomers may be obtained from the free bases of the
isomers by exact neutralisation of either base, with an organic or inorganic acid corresponding to the salt desired. Thus, by way of example, any desired
organic or inorganic salt of the optically active isomers, in addition to the tartrates initially obtained, as for example, sulphates, hydrochlorides,
oleates, etc., may be obtained by exact neutralisation of either optically active base with the acid corresponding to the desired salt. Following the
procedure according to this invention it will be apparent that the l-enantiomorph may be initially separated from the racemic amphetamine, or from any
mixture of the optically active isomers in which the dextro form is not in substantial excess; and that following the separation of the laevo form the
dextro form may be recovered from the mother liquors by the addition thereto of d-tartaric acid for the formation of acid d-tartrates and crystallisation.</p>

<p>Again, as will now be evident, where the l-amphetamine is to be separated from a mixture of the optically active isomers in which the dextro form is in
substantial excess, or in preponderance, the dextro form will first be separated by crystallisation following treatment with d-tartaric acid to form
d-bitartrates and the laevo form will then be recovered by crystallisation following neutralisation with the formation of neutral d-tartrates.</p>

<p>Thus, it will now be understood that the method in accordance with this invention comprises essentially the separation of l-amphetamine from a racemic
amphetamine and from the various mixtures of d- and l-amphetamine in which the laevo form is present in amount not substantially less than the dextro form
with the use of d-tartaric acid for the formation of neutral d-tartrates and separation of l-amphetamine d-tartrate by crystallisation , whether the
procedure be for the initial separation of the l-amphetamine d-tartrate, as from racemic amphetamine, or a mixture in which the dextro form is not in
substantial excess, or is preceded by preliminary separation of the dextro form by known methods, as in the case of mixtures in which the dextro form
predominates.</p>

<p>It will be understood that proceeding in accordance with this invention the free base, l-amphetamine may be readily obtained from the l-amphetamine
d-tartrate by treatment of the d-tartrate with alkali in excess, resulting in separation of the free base as an oil which may be recovered and purified
by any well known method.</p>

<h3>Resolution of racemic Methamphetamine</h3>

<p>85 parts of racemic methamphetamine are introduced into a solution of 100 parts of d-tartaric acid in 1000 parts of methyl alcohol. After protracted
standing about 100 parts of the precipitated salt are aspirated off and extracted with hot ethyl alcohol. Since the d-tartrate of dextrorotary
methamphetamine is readily soluble in both methyl and ethyl alcohol whereas the d-tartrate of levorotary methamphetamine is sparingly soluble both in
methyl alcohol and hot ethyl alcohol an extremely simple separation of the d-tartrates of the optical antipodes of the base is effected.</p>

the dextro isomer of alkali in excess, as, for example, by the addition of an aqueous solution of caustic soda, which will cause the base to separate as
an oil which may be recovered and purified by any well-known procedure. The base is exactly neutralized with sulfuric acid to give the sulfate.</p>

<h3>Resolution of racemic Methamphetamine using selective extraction</h3>

<p>The dextro isomer of amphetamine and methamphetamine is the d, (+), D or S isomer; the levo isomer is the l, (-), L or R isomer. The racemic mixtures may
be referred to as d,l or (+,-) or DL or (R)(S). Classical resolution techniques are often tedious and usually afford poor yields. The best published procedure
seems to be that of Rusznak et al. below which utilizes a selective extraction rather than the usual crystallization.</p>

<h3>Resolution of racemic Methamphetamine using O,O-Dibenzoyl-R,R-Tartaric Acid</h3>

<p>Using O,O-Dibenzoyl-2R,3R-Tartaric Acid (made by acylating L(+)-tartaric acid with benzoyl chloride) in dichloroethane/methanol/water, racemic
methamphetamine can be resolved in 80-95% yield, with an optical purity of 85-98%.</p>

<p><b>Experimental</b></p>

<p>15.0g (100 mmol) of racemic methamphetamine freebase was dissolved in a mixture of 20ml dichloroethane and 15ml water. A solution of 9.4g (25 mmol)
O,O-Dibenzoyl-<em>2R,3R</em>-tartaric acid in 40ml of dichloroethane and methanol (see amounts below) was added to the two-phase solution during 30 minutes at room
temp. From the stirred solution the crystallization starts in 10-15 minutes. The resulting suspension was stirred at 5ï¿½C overnight, then filtered. The
precipitate was washed on the filter three times with 5ï¿½C dichloroethane and air dried under a heat lamp. The precipitated salt were dissolved in 30ml 2N
NaOH and extracted with 3x25ml dichloromethane. After drying over MgSO4, filtering and evaporation of the solvent, the methamphetamine freebase was obtained,
which can be dissolved in diethyl ether and bubbled with dry HCl gas to obtain the crystalline hydrochloride salt.</p>

<p>Using 3ml methanol in the above procedure gave d(+)-methamphetamine in 93% yield and 85% optical purity, and 18.8ml methanol gave 78% yield in 98% optical
purity.</p>
