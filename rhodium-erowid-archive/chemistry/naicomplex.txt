                           NaI Addition complex V1.0
                                   by Hellman
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prebullshit.
Don't like distillation,??.
Want to have a 'no lab' police friendly home?

Ever tried the bisulfite addition, for that matter ever obtained sodium
bisulfite, instead of the meta bisulfite brewers special mix.? Well now the
confusion has come to an end, we here at hellman laboratories have had those
monkeys working hard, damn hard, just to make life a little easier for us
toothless nutctackers,.

Throw away your brewers concocktion, for his sturdier younger brother is here.
Yes, I'm talking NaI, Sodium iodide, this really is something you can make at
home, you see along time ago, a man came up with the bisulfite addition, well he
didn't come up with it, he merely read vogel's practical organic chemistry from
front to back,. If you look at the third edition book, somewhere on page 408,
you will indeed see where elusis's motivation came from,.

But, what he didn't tell us was that Nai will in fact I believe do a better job
at performing an addition product,. Well this ol' bee thoughT hmm,

Requirements
1) 60 grams red oily dirty ketone
2) 10 grams NaI( a huge excess to be safe)
3) some sort of half assed reflux apparatus

#note- one molecule of NaI connects with 3 molecules of ketone,you'll just have
       to work out the math for yourself.

Method.

One would place the ketone 60g into your reflux apparatus, then plonk in your
10g NaI, and then warm to reflux, as soon as it starts to reflux, dump the
beaker/vessel into cold ice/acetonewater to bring down the temp -8C, where by
little crystals will start forming, and the addition complex has been made,
filter of these crystals, and then relux again to see if more form.

Wash with toluene, filter, repeat, and your home with approx 20-40g NaIketone
depending on your method of formation.

to release your ketone simply add 300ml of water to the crystals, and gently
warm, the ketone should float to the top, and the NaI/water should remain on the
bottom, Pippete od the oil, and soldier on son'.

c) When only a relativly small quantity of pure, dry acetone is required, it may
be purified through the bisulfite complex: the latter is decomposed with sodium
carbonate solution, dried over anhydrous calcium sulphate then distilled.
A more convenient proceedure is to make use of the addition compound with sodium
iodide (NaI,3C3H6O), which decomposes on gentle heating and is particularly well
adapted for the preperation of pure acetone.
One hundred grams of finely powdered sodium iodide are dissolved under reflux in
440f of commercial acetone, and the solution is cooled in a mixture of ice and
salt(-8C).
The crystals are filtered off and quickly transferred to a dry distilling flask,
connected to an efficient condensor and to a reciever in cooled ice.Upon gentle
warming, the acetone distills rapidly.

(then the book goes on to say that it is also well suited to ethyl methyl ketone)
