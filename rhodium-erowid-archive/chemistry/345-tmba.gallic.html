<h4>Rosenmund reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride<a href="345-tmba.gallic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></h4>

<p><b>Procedure</b></p>

<p>A pressure vessel (<strong>Note 1</strong>) is charged in order with 600mL of dry toluene (<strong>Note 2</strong>), 25g (0.30 mole) of anhydrous sodium acetate (<strong>Note 3</strong>), 3g of dry, 10% palladium-on-carbon
catalyst (<strong>Note 4</strong>), 23g (0.10 mole) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride (<strong>Note 5</strong>), and 1mL of Quinoline S (<strong>Note 6</strong>). The pressure vessel is flushed with nitrogen, sealed,
evacuated briefly, and pressured to 50 p.s.i. with hydrogen. The mixture is shaken with 50 p.s.i. of hydrogen for 1 hour at room temperature (<strong>Note 7</strong>), then heated at 35?40? C
for 2 hours. Agitation is continued overnight while the reaction mixture cools to room temperature. The pressure on the vessel is released, the vessel is opened, and the
mixture is filtered through 10g of Celite filter aid, and the insoluble material is washed with 25mL of toluene. The combined filtrates are washed successively with 25mL of 5%
sodium carbonate solution and 25mL of water. The toluene solution is dried over 5g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated by distillation at
reduced pressure using a water aspirator. The residue (<strong>Note 8</strong>) is distilled through a 10-cm. Vigreux column with warm water circulating through the condenser, to prevent
crystallization of the distillate, yielding 12.5?16.2g (64?83%) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, bp 158?161?C/7?8 mmHg, mp 74?75?C (<strong>Note 9</strong>) and (<strong>Note 10</strong>).</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ol>
<li><span class="oli">Both glass-lined and stainless-steel autoclaves have been used successfully. The checkers used a 1200 mL Hastelloy autoclave.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Reagent grade toluene was heated at reflux to remove a small forerun, then allowed to cool.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Anhydrous sodium acetate was dried in a vacuum oven at 115? C for 48 hours. The use of less than 3 moles of sodium acetate per mole of acid chloride results in a lower yield of product.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">A catalyst available from Engelhard Industries was used after being dried in a vacuum oven at 115? C for 48 hours. <i><strong>Caution!</strong> Palladium-on-carbon is pyrophoric, and vacuum drying increases this hazard. Catalysts kept in the oven for longer periods of time were extremely pyrophoric.</i></span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The acid chloride or the acid may be purchased from <em>Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc</em>. The acid chloride must be pure (99% minimum by GC analysis) whether purchased or prepared. Purification was effected by recrystallization from Skellysolve B.</span></li>

<li><span class="oli">Quinoline S was prepared according to the procedure in <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p1007"><strong>Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 3, 629 (1955)</strong></a></span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Repressuring with hydrogen is required during this period. The amount of repressuring required is dependent upon the free space of the pressure vessel. The submitters report lower yields if the pressure falls below 30 psi. No further repressuring is made at the end of 1 hour.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The crude aldehyde (prior to distillation) is sufficiently pure for most purposes. Isolation of the aldehyde may also be achieved via the bisulfite-addition compound.<br>
  <em>[A. I. Vogel, <strong><a href="vogel3.html">Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed.</a></strong>, Wiley, New York, 1956, p. 322.]</em></span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The product shows a strong IR band (KBr) at 1690 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C=O).<br>

  <sup>1</sup>H NMR  (CCl<sub>4</sub>): &delta; 3.84 <em>(s, 3H)</em>, 3.87 <em>(s, 6H)</em>, 7.03 <em>(s, 2H)</em>, and 9.76 <em>(s, 1H)</em>.</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">The submitters state that the aldehyde is obtained in 78?84% yield when the reaction is conducted on a scale 5 times that described. The amount of catalyst and Quinoline S need not be increased proportionately. The pressure vessel is charged with 3L of dry toluene, 123g of anhydrous sodium acetate, 10g of dry, 10% palladium-on-carbon catalyst, 115g of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride, and 4mL of Quinoline S.</span></li>

<p><b>Methyl 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzoate</b></p>

<p>A solution of gallic acid hydrate (29.9 g) in DMF (100 ml) was added to a suspension of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (97 g) in DMF (200 ml) with vigorous
  stirring. Dimethyl sulfate (66 ml) was added dropwise to the above mixture at 20-25?C. After completion of the addition, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2.5 h.
  The above procedure was repeated using a further amount of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (44 g) and Me<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (30 ml), then the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for a further 4.5 h,
  poured into water, and extracted with Et<sub>2</sub>O. The ethereal solution was dried over K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and evaporated to dryness. Recrystallization of the residue from MeOH gave pale yellow
  prisms (32.7 g), mp 85-86?C.</p>

  
<p><b>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl Alcohol</b></p>

<p>A solution of Methyl 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzoate (9.86 g) in abs. benzene (40 ml) was added dropwise to Vitride (22 ml) under ice
  cooling. After the mixture had been stirred at room temperature for a further hour the complex was decomposed with 25% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (290ml). The benzene layer was separated from the
  aqueous layer, which was extracted with benzene. The organic layers were combined, washed with 5% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> aq.. and then dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the benzene solution
  gave an oily product (7.84 g).</p>
  
<p><b>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde</b></p>

<p>Pyridinium dichromate (16.9 g) was added a solution of the crude alcohol (5.92 g) in dry CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, (43 ml) at 18-19?C with stirring. After
  stirring at room temperature for 3.5 h, further PDC (3.38 g) was added to the mixture and the whole was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted
  with benzene and the diluted solution was filtered through a column packed with Celite 545 with the aid of an air-pump. Evaporation of the benzene filtrate under reduced
  pressure gave colorless prisms (5.74g), mp 76-78?C.</p>

<h4>3,4,5-TMBA by Sommelet Reaction of 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl chloride<a href="345-tmba.gallic.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a></h4> 

<p>To a solution of 11 g of hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) in 70 mL of chloroform was added 18 g (0.07 mole) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl chloride. The
solution was refluxed for 4 hr during which time a precipitate of the quaternary salt was formed. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 35 mL of acetone was
added. The precipitate was filtered off and heated for 20 min with 100 mL of water. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (17.5 mL) was added and the refluxing was continued for 5
min. After concentration under reduced pressure and cooling the precipitated aldehyde was filtered off. It forms colourless needles from benzene (12 g, 66% yield), mp 72-74?C.</p>

<h4>3,4,5-TMBA by oxidation of the alcohol with bromine<a href="345-tmba.gallic.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a></h4>

<p>A solution of 39.6 g (0.2 mole) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl alcohol in 250 ml of methanol was stirred and cooled to 0?C. Bromine (54 ml) was added with
stirring over a period of one hr keeping the temperature at 0?C. The stirred mixture was allowed to acquire room tempterature gradually and stirred
further for 2 hr. A saturated solution of sodium thiosulfate (about 30 ml) was added to effect complete decomposition of excess bromine.
3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde was filtered off and recrystallized from benzene to give 31 g (80%) as colourless needles, m.p. 73-74?C.</p>

<h3>3,4,5-TMBA via reduction of the Ethyl Carbonate</h3>
<p><b>Step (a): preparation of 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzoyl ethyl carbonate.</b></p>

<p>10.8 g (0.10 moles) of ethyl chloroformate are dissolved in ml 100 of tetrahydrofuran. This solution is then added under stirring and cooling at 5-10?C., during 10-30 minutes
to a solution of 21.2 g (0.10 moles) of 3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzoic acid and 12.12 g (0.12 moles) of triethylamine in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran. At the end of the addition the
reaction mixture is kept at the room temperature during 2 hours under continuous stirring. The so-formed precipitate is filtered, throughly washed with tetrahydrofuran and discarded.
On the joined reaction solution and washing liquids, we may directly proceed to the catalytic reduction for the preparation of the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde.</p>

<p>The 3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzoyl-ethyl carbonate may be isolated by means of complete evaporation under a vacuum of the mother liquids at the temperature between 50-70?C.
The residue is a white microcristalline solid (26.7 g; yield 94%) with mp 92-94?C. The substance is remarkably stable and keeps well also at room temperature. It is not affected by moisture.</p>

<p><b>Step (b): Reduction to 3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzaldehyde</b></p>

<p>To a solution of 28.4 g (10.1 moles) of 3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzoylethyl carbonate in 300 mL <span class="redtxt">[???]</span>, prepared as described in step (<strong>a</strong>), 14.2 g of Pd supported on BaSO<sub>4</sub> (10%) and
0.1 ml of a solution of sulfur and quinoline prepared following Rosemund and Zetzsche and diluted 1:3000 are added. The mixture is hydrogenated in a PARR apparatus in an
hydrogen atmosphere at ordinary pressure and 25&deg;C. under efficient shaking during 12 hours. The catalyst is removed by filtration and recovered, whereas the organic
solution is washed with a 5% NaOH solution and finally evaporated in a vacuum. 17.64 g of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde are obtained, with the same characteristics generally
described in the literature.</p>

<h3>Reduction of 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylcyanide To Mescaline</h3>

<p><em>The same general procedure can be used for the reduction of 2,5-dimethoxy-benzylcyanide</em></p>

<p>Placed 11.6 g (0.056 mol) of 3,4,5-tri-MeO-benzylcyanide in flask, added 300 ml of methanol, and then 20 g of  NiCl<sub>2</sub>&middot;6H<sub>2</sub>O. Under magnetic stirring
added 19g (0.5 mol) of NaBH<sub>4</sub> in small portions over 30 min. Immediately black color appeared. Temp. during the addition rose to 40-50?C, and evolution
of H<sub>2</sub> observed. Flask was cooled with an ice/water bath to prevent violent boiling. When addition of borohydride was complete ice bath was removed and
flask stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, after cooling 200 ml of 3N HCl added to the reaction mixture and the black solids filtered <em>[recycling
the nickle boride]</em>. After removal of methanol at the rotovap unreacted nitrile <em>[~1gm]</em> was extracted with DCM, the aqueous layer made alkaline with conc.
ammonia soln <em>[turns deep blue upon addition of ammonia]</em> and then extracted with DCM 3x100 ml. Combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>and evaporated. Obtained an oil (8.2g, 71% yield) which was converted to the HCl salt by dissolving in 20 ml IPA, acidified w/110 drops conc. HCl <em>[to pH 4]</em>and precipitated by the addition of 100 ml diethyl ether to yield 8.5 gm snow white needles <em>[62% yield overall]</em>.</p>
