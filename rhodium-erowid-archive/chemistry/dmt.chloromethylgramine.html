<i>The Mannich reaction of ClCH<sub>2</sub>CHO with indoles in the presence of
NHR<sub>3<sub>2</sub></sub> gave gramines I (R = H, Me;
NR<sub>3<sub>2</sub></sub> = NMe<sub>2</sub> morpholino; R<sub>3</sub>
= H, MeO) which were reduced by NaBH<sub>4</sub> to the corresponding
tryptamines II. Hydrolysis of I gave the amino alcs. which also
rearranged to the a-hydroxytryptamines; dimerization during hydrolysis
was also obsd. Treating II with addnl. ClCH<sub>2</sub>CHO gave
tetrahydrocarbolines III (Q = CHCH<sub>2</sub>X, X = Cl, OH, H,
SO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Me-p) by a Pictet-Spengler
condensation. Redn. with NaBH<sub>4</sub> gave the azepinoindole III
(Q = CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>).</i>

<br><font color="black"><b>Introduction:</font color="black"></b>

</p>

<p>

The condensation of indole with chloroacetaldehyde and dimethylamine
provided the alpha-chloro-methyl-gramine 1a isolated in the form of
its chlorhydrate. The base of Mannich 1e of the methoxy-5-indole with
chloroacetaldehyde and dimethylamine also has been prepared. The
yields vary from 30 to 45%.

</p>

<p>

An interesting and simple reaction of those chloromethyl-gramines was
the reduction in ionizing medium (6, 7). The reduction of the
alpha-chloromethyl-gramine 1a by sodium tetrahydroborate in diglyme
provided the dimethyl tryptamine (DMT) (yield 37%).

</p>

<p>

The methyl-1 and methoxy-5 dimethyl tryptamines 2b and 2e have also
been prepared.

</p>

<br><font color="black"><b>Experimental:</b></font>

</p>

<p>

<b><font color="purple">alpha-chloro-methyl-gramine 1a, method A</b></font>

</p>

<p>

Stir at RT, till dissolution, 2,75g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in a
slurry of 50 mL of GAA and 25 mL of propionic acid. Add to this
solution 11.7 g of indole (0.1 mol) and 8.8g (0.11mol) of
dimethylamine-HCl in 5 mL of diglyme. Cool between -5�C and 0�C and
add 11g of chloroacetaldehyde hydrate (containing 75% of the
chloroacetaldehyde, 0.1 mol). Stir for 1 hour and keep the temp below
0�C then keep it for 5 days in the freezer at +5�C. Pour the reaction
on some piece of ice. A white, snow-like precipitate form. This
precipitate (the product of the indolic condensation) is essored. The
acid filtrate is extracted with cold ether. The aqueous layer is then
energically cooled and ether is added. With stiring this solution is
neutralised with some aqueous NaOH. The following operations are then
effectued rapidly: decant the ether layer, dry it on
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and then with stirring and at low
temperature add some hydrochloric ether.

</p>

<p>

The alpha-chloromethyl-gramine HCl (1a) fall as a viscous oil. The
ether is decanted, and the oil is recrystallised with a little
absolute EtOH. Add if necessary anhydrous Et<sub>2</sub>O. The product
may have a pink coloration.

</p>

<p>

Crude yield: 11.7 g (45%), mp=131�.  Recrystallise 3 times in
Et<sub>2</sub>O-EtOH or acetonitrile, final yield: 8.2g (32%),
mp=138�C.

</p>

<p>

<b><font color="purple">N,N-dimethyl tryptamine 2a</b></font>

</p>

<p>

1 g of alpha-chloromethyl-gramine HCl is added to a suspension of 2,5
g of NaBH<sub>4</sub> in 75 mL of diglyme at 55�C with stirring. The
slurry is warmed to 85-90�C and is kept at that temperature for 48h.
The yellow coloration has disappeared. After 24h the mixture is cooled
and poured on some ice. This is extracted with ethyl acetate and then
the solvent is removed. The remaining oil has got a scatole stench and
the TLC show two spot with Rf equal respectively to authentic sample
of scatole and of DMT. These two products are separated by column
chromatography (silice-celite 1/1). The scatole is eluted first with
benzene and is identified by its mp and its picrate salt. The DMT is
eluted with methanol (270 mg, 37%). After one recrystalisation with
hexane, the product melt at 45�C, this mp is inchanged when authentic
sample is mixed with it. The DMT is confirmed by its picrate salt, mp
166�C, and by its UV and IR spectra.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Same procedure. With 1g of the chloromethyl-amino-indole HCl we obtain
an oil with only one spot on TLC. The picrate of this indolic base has
got a correct analyse on C,H and N. It melt at 176�C. The freebase
crystallise and its mp is 69�C. Yield: 28%, the HCl salt has a mp of
146�C.
