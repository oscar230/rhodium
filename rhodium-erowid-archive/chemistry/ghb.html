<H3><a name="1">1) Introduction</a></H3>

This file deals with the synthesis of GHB and related compounds. It is assumed that the reader already know about the pharmacological
aspects of GHB (or else shuld consult the "General Info" references below). It is highly dangerous to attempt a synthesis of GHB without
the proper knowledge of practical organic chemistry, and illegal and immoral to even try to sell such a product. This text does not in
any way encourage anyone to break the law, or ingest GHB or related pharmaceuticals. Depending on where you live, the manufacture, use and
possession of GHB may range from being perfectly legal to being a felony. I suggest you check out your local laws before doing anything
stupid. And - please don't mix GHB with alcohol.


<H3><a name="2">2) Chemistry and Synthesis</a></H3>

The far most simple way to produce GHB is by the hydrolysis of the corresponding lactone (a cyclic intramolecular ester) to the desired
hydroxy acid. Ester hydrolysis can be done in two ways: An acid catalyzed reaction or a base catalyzed reaction. The base catalyzed
reaction is our choice here, because the reaction is not reversible like the acid catalyzed one and therefore we will get higher yields,
and we will get the sodium salt of GHB, as the free acid is not stable, and will immediately cyclize into gamma-butyrolactone again.

<center>
<p><img src="pictures/ghbsyn.gif">
<br><H5>Gamma-Butyrolactone + NaOH => Sodium Gamma-Hydroxy Butyrate (Na-GHB)</H5>
</center>

The reaction proceeds equimolarly (the same number of each molecule reacts), and there are <b>no</b> byproducts produced in this reaction,
such as hydrogen gas, water, or anything else as proposed in several other texts. All published preparations of GHB, or more correctly
Na-GHB, refluxes butyrolactone with sodium hydroxide in various solvents, usually in aqueous alcohol, but this is not necessary.

<p>Lab procedures for the synthesis of GHB salts:

<p>Please follow common Lab Safety procedures. Wear a lab coat and protective glasses. You will work with hot caustic solutions and
solvents! Be aware of the risks associated with the manufacture of GHB! Never work alone!

<h4><a name="NA">Sodium GHB</a></h4>

<p><b>Procedure:</b>

<br>Dissolve 130 grams (3.25 moles) of pure sodium hydroxide in 400ml of tap water in a 1000ml glass container while stirring with a
glass rod or similar. The dissolution is exothermic, and the solution will heat up. When everything has dissolved to form a clear solution,
slowly add 250ml (280 g, 3.25 moles) of gamma-butyrolactone in 50 ml portions with good stirring. The addition of gamma-butyrolactone to
the sodium hydroxide solution is also exothermic, and if it is added too fast the solution will begin to boil, and we don't want that. Keep
track of the temperature with an immersed thermometer. The addition of the gamma-butyrolactone will take somewhere between 20-30 minutes.
When everything has been added, let the mixture react for an additional 10 minutes with occasional stirring.</p>

<p>Now it is time to see if the reaction has gone to completion by checking the pH with universal pH paper. We are aiming for a pH of
7-8. If it is too high (pH > 8), then add 10 ml of gamma-butyrolactone and let react for a few minutes more. If the pH is too low (pH < 7), add a few ml of concentrated NaOH solution. Continue like this until the pH level is within the desired limits.</p>

<p>The solution is perfectly clear and tastes slightly salty. It may be slightly yellow colored, but not much if pure enough
butyrolactone was used (distillation of the lactone before use takes care of this problem). If an acid is used to neutralize a too basic a solution
(instead of adding more lactone), crystals of the sodium salt of the acid can precipitate in the solution, and the taste is severely impaired. The final
solution will be around 750 mL 50% NaGHB. The solution can be concentrated (by boiling off excess water) to ~600mL without it crystallizing
at room temp, but if concentrating as far as to ~500 mL it will invariably solidify.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Sodium GHB using Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>)</strong><br>
<em>Written by Chromic</em></p>

<p>Add 273 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (3.25 moles) to 1125 mL distilled water in a glass container. Slowly bring the solution to 
a boil while stirring with a glass rod or similar. All of the baking soda will dissolve. Carbon dioxide will be seen leaving 
the solution as it comes to a boil. This is the sodium bicarbonate breaking down into a slightly strong base, sodium 
carbonate:</p>

<p>2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> -> Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>Reduce the heat to a light boil, and slowly add 250ml <em>gamma</em>-Butyrolactone (280g, 3.25 moles). The addition is not 
immediately exothermic as with the sodium hydroxide synthesis. Keep this solution at a light boil for 30 minutes.
Check the pH with universal pH paper. We are aiming for a pH around 7, but anything 6 to 8 is perfectly safe. If the pH 
is too high, add a small amount more GBL and continue to reflux.</p>

<p>The solution will be perfectly clear and should be absolutely colorless. If it is not perfectly colorless, i.e. if 
slightly impure butyrolactone was used and the solution has taken on a light yellow color, add about 100 mL of activated 
charcoal. Allow this to boil for 10 minutes. Cool the solution then filter, washing the activated charcoal two or three times with  50 ml 
portions of cold water. 410g of NaGHB will be made in this synthesis. This solution can be concentrated to about 50% NaGHB before it will start 
to crystallize. If you wish for a powder, heat until the temperature of the solution reaches 150&deg;C then pour onto a flexible 
metal sheet and allow it to cool and solidify.</p>

<p>This synthesis is perfect for use where there is no ACS, Food or Electronics grade sodium hydroxide available.</p>

<h5>Literature methods</h5>

<p>Sodium GHB has  been made from NaOH and butyrolactone in water<b>[8]</b>, in methanol<b>[10,11]</b>, and aqueous ethanol<b>[12]</b>

<h4><a name="K">Potassium GHB</a></h4>

Use the ethanol synthesis described above for sodium GHB, but substitute the 130 grams of NaOH for 182 grams of KOH (This calculation is based
on the heavier K atom, and the higher water content of KOH versus NaOH). Using KOH gives users of K-GHB that Potassium supplement that is by
some said to be needed in connection with administration of GHB. Bear in mind that (powdered) K-GHB is slightly less active (by weight) than
Na-GHB as the K ion is heavier than the Na counterpart. Differences between K-GHB and Na-GHB is that the K salt is more soluble in water
than the Na salt, and the taste is more like salt/licorice instead of the salt/soap taste of Na-GHB. In the book "Better Sex Through
Chemistry" by J. Morgenthaler it is pointed out that "[GHB] has a salty/licorice flavor" and it is obvious that the author tried the K salt.<p></p>

<h4><a name="CA">Calcium GHB [5]</a></h4>

<p>74 g analytically pure calcium hydroxide are suspended in 200 ml of tap water. 160 ml 4-butyrolactone are added in portions (each portion
about 5 to 10 ml) and under stirring to this suspension at room temperature. After addition of 20 ml the reaction mixture warms to about
50� to 60�C. The addition of 4-butyrolactone is controlled such that the temperature remains between about 50� and 60�C, which takes about
1 hour. During this time the calcium hydroxide has dissolved practically completely. The reaction material is contaminated with a slight
rust-yellow precipitate. It is thinned down with 300 ml methanol, is left for four hours to itself and is then filtered through a folded
filter. The clear filtrate is cautiously treated with 200 ml acetone in the way that after each portion of acetone causing a precipitate
time is allowed for the precipitate to redissolve. A waterclear solution is obtained which is placed for crystallization. After two hours
of standing colorless crystals start to deposit. In this state the crystallization is accelerated by continuous addition of acetone (in
total 100 ml). The crystallization time is 24 hours. The crystals are sucked off and are washed initially with 50 ml methanol and then
additionally with 60 ml acetone. The crystals are dried at temperatures from about 60� to 80�C. in a drying cabinet. Yield: 230 g. Melting
point 166-168�C. (immediately). The product is the waterfree nonhygroscopic calcium salt of the 4-hydroxybutyric acid. It is dissolvable
as desired in water, the aqueous solution has a pH- value of 7 to 7.5. The salt can be stored as long as desired and does not change in
air. Even upon storage no water is attracted from the air.</p>

<p>The residue crystallizes to a mass of colorless crystals, which is after dried at temperatures from about 60� to 80�C. Yield:
about 105 g. Melting point 164-166�C. The product is Di-(4-hydroxybutyric) calcium. It is recrystallized by dissolving in little
methanol followed by adding of acetone to cloudiness, and crystallizing in the cold.</p>

<p>Instead of methanol also ethanol and isopropanol can be employed for recrystallization with the same
success. Without employing water containing alcohols as recrystallization medium or as additive of the
recrystallization and purification no stable and in particular no nonhygroscopic calcium salts are obtained.
The water content of the alcohols should be from about 3-10% by volume. The such obtained final product does
easily dissolve in water, is not hydroscopic and has a pleasant aromatic odor.</p>

<h4><a name="MG">Magnesium GHB [5]</a></h4>

<p>60 g magnesium hydroxide (analytical grade) are suspended in 200 ml tap water under stirring. In a stream and under stirring 160 ml
butyrolactone are mixed into this suspension. Then the mixture is heated on a water bath for 6 hours under stirring in a 2-liter-flask.
The magnesium hydroxide dissolves practically completely. The flask is allowed to stand overnight, while contaminants deposit and the
solution is decanted without effort from the contaminant deposit. The water clear decantate is initially stirred with 100 ml acetone for
10 minutes. The colorless sirupy liquid, which now turned more viscous, is mixed again with 100 ml acetone as described above, the
acetone is again removed by decanting and the fairly viscous, colorless sirup is left to itself at room temperature for about 2 to 4
hours. It solidifies to a colorless crystal mass, which is comminuted in a mortar and dried for several hours in air. Melting point 76�C
to 78�C. Yield: 314 g in analytically pure form.</p>

<p>This magnesium salt contains about 5 mole of water of hydration. It is not hydroscopic, is stable and can
be stored for arbitrary long times. By drying over several hours at 40� to 50�C it loses part of its water (1
mole) of crystallization and then melts at 118� to 120�C. Waterfree magnesium 4-hydroxybutyrate can be
produced by removal of water by sublimation and/or evaporation of water under decreased partial pressure of
water and at elevated temperature or by crystallization from a solution containing an organic solvent. The
waterfree salt melts at 172-174&deg;C. The chemical analysis shows 10.50 weight percent magnesium (calculated
10.55 weight percent magnesium). All modifications are nonhygroscopic and stable during storage. 1g of the
magnesium salt dissolves in 2 ml water at room temperature, the pH of the aqueous solution is 7.</p>

<p>It dissolves easily in water, methanol and ethanol, it does not dissolve in ether and hydrocarbons, it is
not hygroscopic, is storable and has a pleasant aromatic odor.</P>


<h4><a name="OS">Other salts</a></h4>

<p>The Lithium and Ammonium salts of GHB would be dangerous to ingest. Lithium ion is toxic, and together with NH3 lactone becomes pyrrolidone.</p>

<H3><a name="3">3) Synthesis Q&A</a></H3>

<b>Q:</b> Can I use lye instead of pure sodium hydroxide?
<br><b>A:</b> No, that could have unpredictable results on your health. Hardware store lye does not have anywhere near the rigorous purity
criterions of for example food grade, ACS grade or electronics grade. Some people tells about successful stories using lye, which really
<b>is</b> possible, but as said, the results are unpredictable.

<br>
<br><b>Q:</b> I do not have the glassware you say are needed, can I boil the solution in a pot on the stove instead?
<br><b>A:</b> No, you can not. The sodium hydroxide will corrode the metal, and assorted metal ions will get into your product. You can of
       course use simpler glassware than in my suggestions, and make the neccessary adjustments of the procedure.
<br>
<br><b>Q:</b> I cannot recrystallize the Na-GHB from ethanol. It forms a sticky mess.
<br><b>A:</b> Your Na-GHB is not dry, or your ethanol is not anhydrous. Water makes the recrystallation almost impossible. The fact that
        the sodium GHB is deliquescent (hygroscopic) does not make this better. You must dry the GHB thoroughly, preferably in a vacuum
        desiccator before attempting recrystallization, or any other improvised alternative. The ethanol you are planning to use (most
        often supplied in a purity of 95%, the rest being water) must be dried by drying over anhydrous calcium sulfate followed by
        distillation from calcium oxide with adequate measures taken to exclude moisture from the reaction.
<br>
<br><b>Q:</b> Where can I buy butyrolactone/Is it safe to buy butyrolactone?
<br><b>A:</b> I have no idea how the situation is for you in your country. The answers to these questions highly depends on who you are
        and where you live. However, you can contact any of the many sellers of GHB Kits which can be found online.
<br>
<br><b>Q:</b> Is GHB legal to manufacture/sell/possess etc?
<br><b>A:</b> As above, this depends on where you live. However, where GHB yet isn't scheduled, GHB shuld be legal to both possess and
       manufacture (don't take my word for it!). Erowid has a <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/chemicals/ghb/ghb_law.html">good page</a>
       about the legal aspects of GHB.

<H3><a name="4">4) GHB Analogs and Derivates</a></H3>

<p>Attempts have been made to prolong and/or slightly modify the effects of GHB, with small alterations of the GHB molecule.
This section is also known as GIHKAL (GHB-analogs I Have Known And Loved :-)</p>

<h4><a name="MAB">Methyl 4-Acetoxy Butanoate (MAB) [14,15]</a></h4>

<b>Dosage:</b> 250-2500mg
<br><b>Duration:</b> 6-12 h (depending on dosage)
<br>
<b>Qualitative effects:</b> The effect of this ester is mostly a powerful muscle
relaxant effect, with a very long duration. The accompanying high is less euphoric
than the one produced by GHB, although the somatic effects are very nice.
Another bioassay can be read <a href="mab.dabd.html">here</a>.
<br>
<b>Comment:</b> The synthesis below can also be used to make EAB (Ethyl 4-Acetoxy Butanate), if you substitute absolute ethanol for
       the methanol. The small amount of methanol released over time in the metabolism of MAB is probably not harmful, and the toxicity
       of EAB is in the literature said to be in the same ballpark as GHB. The smell and taste of MAB is much like petroleum ether.
<br>
<b>Synthesis:</b> 80 grams (71.5ml) of gamma-Butyrolactone and 8 grams (4ml)
 98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was dissolved in 500ml of methanol in a 1L erlenmeyer flask, which
was left standing for a week with occasional swirling. Powdered sodium carbonate
was carefully added until
       further additions did not produce foaming, then 20 grams anhydrous sodium
sulfate was added to dry the solution. The solution was filtered and the excess
solvent was removed by distilling up to 75�C, discarding the distillate. The
concentrated residue was taken up in 250 ml of water and was extracted with 3x200ml
CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The extracts was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and filtered with suction. The
       solvent was removed by distillation up to 80�C (save this impure chloroform,
       dry it over MgSO4 and re-distill it, saving the fraction between 60-62�C
       for reuse). The residue was fainty yellow, and was slowly poured into
       a 1000ml round-bottomed flask containing 80g acetic anhydride and 100ml
       pyridine, which was clamped in an ice-bath. After the addition was complete,
       the
       stoppered flask was left overnight with the ice allowed to melt. A solution
       of 100ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (12M), 100 ml water and 200g of
       ice was prepared and carefully added. Two layers formed, and 100 ml chloroform
       was added. The aqueous layer was
       extracted with three 100 ml portions of chloroform, and the nonaqueous
       layer was combined with the extracts. The extract was carefully treated
       with 50ml saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate in a separatory funnel
       (a lot of CO2 gas was evolved), followed
       by shaking, and the aqueous layer was removed. The organic layer was then
       washed with 50 ml saturated sodium chloride solution, then dried over
       anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The dried solution was freed
       from chloroform by distilling up to 100�C
       (save this impure chloroform, and purify as above). The residue was a
       slightly yellow liquid amounting about 60ml. This was distilled at the
       water pump, discarding the fore-run consisting of mostly pyridine. The
       ester came over at 97-107�C, and was clear,
       water-white and had a high index of refraction. Yield about 35 grams of
       pure methyl 4-acetoxybutanoate.

       <h4><a name="GBL">gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL)</a></h4>

<b>Dosage:</b> 0.5-3ml
<br><b>Duration:</b> 2-5 h
<br><b>Qualitative effects:</b> Very similar to GHB. More muscle relaxing and less prone to give clonic muscle movements than GHB.
       Slightly longer acting, and has a more sedative feeling than GHB. May easily give gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea,
       diarrhoea and gas.
<br><b>Comment:</b> It is not clear if ingesting butyrolactone is toxic or not. It is not cancerogenic as some sources say, but is
       probably not good for you. The taste is extremely disagreeable. The compound has been used as a GHB pro-drug in some studies,
       for example by GHB discoverer H. Laborit <b>[9]</b>. Sold in disguise as the GHB substitute <a href="http://www.renewtrient.com">Renewtrient</a>.

<h4><a name="14BD">1,4-Butanediol (1,4-BD)</a></h4>

<b>Dosage:</b> 0.5-3ml
<br><b>Duration:</b> 2-5h
<br><b>Qualitative effects:</b>
<br><b>Comment:</b> This compound is marketed as the active ingredient in the "natural product" Borametz, sold for the purpose of promoting Growth Hormone release.
<br><b>Synthesis:</b> Available commercially from a number of sources.

<h4><a name="BDDA">1,4-Butanediol Diacetate (BDDA)</a></h4>

<p><b>Dosage:</b> 1-3ml
<br><b>Duration:</b> 2-5h
<br>
<b>Qualitative effects:</b> (as repported by <em>Methaco(s)mic</em>) I have only used doses between 1.0 and 1.5ml. 1.0ml is not felt much and 1.5ml is like a medium dose of GHB. Ordinary 1,4-butanediol feels to me almost exactly as GHB, so what does acetylation do to the effects? It can be felt after 5-10 minutes (tastes like gasoline) the peak of effects occur at the 40 minutes point and then the intoxication gradually dissipates during the following hours and at the 3 hour point the intoxication is over. Perhaps a weak sedation and muscle relaxation lasts to the 5-hour point. The effects are GHB like but not as nice and not euphoric, nothing sexual and the disinhibition is minimal. Relaxing and anxiolytic properties, but not fun. Rather much like MAB perhaps, but without the nice long-lasting positive effects. My stomach doesn't like this stuff I feel like I have to burp but I can't.
<br>
<b>Comment:</b> The smell is very nice and flowery,  but taste is unpleasant and gasoline-like. The water solubility is very low. <br>
<b>Synthesis:</b> 20ml 99% 1,4-butanediol and 45ml 98% acetic anhydride was mixed in a 100ml round-bottomed flask and boiled under reflux for 30 min. The mixture was poured into 200ml water and extracted with 2x70ml chloroform, the pooled chloroform extracts washed with 2x50ml saturated sodium carbonate solution, the organic layer dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the chloroform removed by distillation. The residue was then distilled with aspirator vacuum to yield 25ml DABD.</p>

<h4><a name="THCA">trans-4-Hydroxy-Crotonic Acid (T-HCA) <b>[13,19]</b></a></h4>

<p><b>Dosage:</b>
    <br>
    <b>Duration:</b>
    <br>
    <b>Qualitative effects:</b>
    <br>
    <b>Comment:</b> T-HCA is 16% more potent as a GHB receptor agonist than GHB itself, and most T-HCA (trans-4-hydroxy-2-butenoic acid)
  derivatives are more active than the corresponding GHB homologs. The 4-CH3 analog is 9%, and the 4-Ph analog is 27% more potent than GHB
  itself. The 4-C6H11 analog is 16% less potent than GHB, and cis-4-Hydroxy-Crotonic Acid (C-HCA) is inactive. T-HCA has also been
  identified as a naturally occurring substance in the CNS, which dismisses the theory of T-HCA just being a synthetic semi-rigid analog of
  GHB, but as a possible endogenous receptor ligand, which also competes at GHB receptors, and possibly possesses specific functions of its
  own.</p>
    <b>Synthesis:</b> <p><center><img src="pictures/t-hca.gif"></center></p>
<p>To a solution of 20g (0.23 mole) of crotonic acid (2-butenoic acid) in 200ml
        of dry benzene, 45.6g (0.25 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide was added under
        nitrogen. The solution was brought to a gentle reflux with stirring and
        was treated
        with 0.5g (3.7 mmol) of
      2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile as a radical initiator. Refluxing was continued
        for 2 h, and the solution was cooled to 10�C. The resulting
      white precipitate was filtered off, and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was taken up with 200ml of carbon tetrachloride
      and the mixture was cooled to 0�C and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated
      in vacuo to give 38 gram of a mixture consisting of 85% 4-bromocrotonic
      acid and the rest unreacted starting material. Pure 4-bromocrotonic acid
      can be
      obtained by multiple recrystallizations
      from petroleum ether. </p>
<p>To a cold solution of 12g (72 mmol) of 4-bromocrotonic acid in 120 ml of water was added dropwise 240 ml of a 2M KOH solution in
water. After the addition was completed, the solution was successively heated under reflux for 5 minutes (oil bath temp 120�C), cooled
in an ice bath, and acidified with dilute H2SO4. The medium was evaporated under vacuum, and extracted with ethyl ether. After the drying
and evaporation of the solvent, the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column eluted with a mixture of EtOAc:MeOH (97:3) to yield
5.22 g (71%) of pure T-HCA. After recrystallization from EtOAc, the mp was found to be 108�C.

<h4><a name="GHV">gamma-Hydroxy-Valeric Acid (GHV, 4-Methyl-GHB) <b>[13]</b></a></h4>

<p><b>Dosage:</b> Similar to GHB.
<br><b>Duration:</b> Similar to GHB.
<br><b>Qualitative effects:</b> See my <a href="4-methyl-ghb.html">4-Methyl-GHB Document</a>
<br><b>Comment:</b> According to reference <b>[13]</b>, GHV is 15% more potent as a GHB receptor agonist compared to GHB itself, and nearly as potent as T-HCA
(trans-Hydroxy Crotonic Acid). The 3-methyl derivative of GHB (GHV is the 4-methyl derivative) is 7% more potent, and the 4-phenyl derivative is just slightly more potent
than GHB itself.</p>

<p><b>Synthesis:</b> 8 grams (0.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide was dissolved in
  50 ml of methanol with gentle heating, and some insolubles was filtered off.
  20 grams of gamma-valerolactone (0.2 moles) was added as fast as the exothermic
  reaction allowed, and the
solvent was evaporated <i>in vacuo</i> and the wet, soapy residue was dried in
a desiccator over CaCl2. The crude product was finely ground in a mortar, placed
in a buchner funnel, washed with 200 ml of acetone and sucked as dry as possible
at the pump. After drying
over CaCl2, the Sodium gamma-Hydroxy-Valerate, a deliquescent, white, crispy
and slightly soapy powder, weighed 26.9 grams (96% of theory) and had a pleasant
aromatic odor, and the taste was not unlike that of Sodium GHB itself.</p>

<h4><a name="DHV">delta-Hydroxy-Valeric Acid (DHV) <b>[13]</b></a></h4>

<b>Dosage:</b> Similar to GHB.
<br><b>Duration:</b> Similar to GHB.
<br><b>Qualitative effects:</b> Similar to <a href="4-methyl-ghb.html">4-Methyl-GHB</a>
<br><b>Comment:</b> Using delta-Valerolactone as starting material yields Sodium delta-Hydroxy-Valerate
(DHV, 5-Hydroxy-Valerate), which is just slightly less potent than GHB <b>[13]</b>.

<p><b>Synthesis:</b> Same as for <a href="4-methyl-ghb.html">4-Methyl-GHB</a>


<H3><a name="5">5) Precursors</a></H3>

<p>The obvious precursor for the synthesis of GHB is gamma-Butyrolactone. It can be made from pre-precursors such as Tetrahydrofuran (THF)
with oxidants such as Ruthenium tetroxide<b>[2]</b>, calcium hypochlorite<b>[3]</b> and nitric acid<b>[4]</b>.</p>
<p><br>
    4-Halo-butyric acid derivatives (chloro, bromo, iodo) can also be used. As
      in the synthesis below, they can be converted to gamma-butyrolactone by
      distillation with sodium methoxide.</p>
<p><b>gamma-Butyrolactone from 4-bromobutyric acid:</b> <em>To a solution of
    7.8 g of sodium in 500 cc of absolute alcohol was added 60.5 g of 4-bromobutyric
    acid. The reaction mixture was boiled under a reflux condenser for about
    five hours. During this time sodium bromide separated. The alcohol was distilled
    from a steam bath, and
the lactone was separated from the sodium bromide by extraction  with ether.
    The ether was evaporated and the lactone distilled under ordinary pressure.
The yield was 21.2 gram (67%) of product boiling at 202-206�C.</em></p>

<p>An alternative may be free radical chlorination of butyric acid with sulfuryl chloride in the presence of peroxides<b>[6]</b>,
and separate the isomers through distillation, make the sodium salt of 4-chlorobutyric acid, and cyclize to the lactone as
with the 4-bromo derivative above.</p>

<p>gamma-Butyrolactone can also be made from 4-methoxybutyric acid<b>[7]</b>, 3-phenoxypropylcyanide<b>[8]</b>,
gamma-diethylaminobutyric acid<b>[1]</b> and beta-chloro ethyl vinyl ether<b>[18]</b> as well as many other a bit too exotic chemicals.
Industrially, it is commonly made by reacting acetylene with formaldehyde under high temperatures and pressures. </p>
<p>A very unusable synthesis comes from Journal of Chemical Education <b>[20]</b>:
<br>
<em>A five-membered cyclic ester, gamma-Butyrolactone, was prepared from GHB
using a microscale reflux method. Cyclization yielded a product with a boiling
point significantly greater (by 129 �C) than that of the open-chain analogue.</em></p>
