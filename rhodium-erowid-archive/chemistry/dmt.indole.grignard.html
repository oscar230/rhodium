<h2>Synthesis of Dimethyltryptamine (DMT)</h2>
  <h4>By Alkylation of Indole Grignards With 2-(Dimethylamino)-Ethyl Chloride</h4>

<div class="stdtxt">

  <p>The reaction of indolylmagnesium iodide with substituted alkyl halides, e.g., 
    the nitriles Cl(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>CN and chloroacetyl diethylamide, 
    to give the corresponding 3-substituted indoles is well established<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>1,2</sup></a> 
    although very reactive halides, such as methyl iodide and benzyl chloride, 
    occasionally give 1,3-disubstituted indoles<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
    We report now that indolylmagnesium iodide is alkylated by &beta;-dimethylaminoethyl 
    chloride to afford N,N-dimethyltryptamine<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. 
    The method appears to be general and, although the reaction conditions are 
    critical, it provides a convenient direct synthesis of substituted tryptamines.</p>

  <p>The indolylmagnesium iodide reagent was prepared in the usual manner<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 
    from an indole and ethylmagnesium iodide in dry anisole at 10�C. The mixture 
    was cooled to -5�C and a solution of 2-molar equivalents of &beta;-dimethylaminoethyl 
    chloride in dry benzene was added. After 8 hours at -5�C the mixture was allowed 
    to warm slowly to room temperature, left overnight, and then added to aqueous 
    ammonium chloride. The product was obtained via extraction into dilute hydrochloric 
    acid and subsequent neutralisation.</p>

  <p>Indole, 2-methylindole and 2-phenylindole afforded respectively, 25, 30 and 
    15% conversion into the corresponding dimethyltryptamines. These were identified 
    by elemental analysis and comparison of infrared spectra and mp with authentic 
    materials<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>5,6</sup></a>. In each case the crude basic 
    product was subjected to thin layer chromatography and no other substituted 
    indoles were detected.</p>

<p>Alternative conditions were investigated for the reaction with 2-phenylindole. We found that, in anisole, a
higher temperature decreased the yield (e.g., only 3% conversion at 40�C) and no alkylated products were
obtained from reactions in tetrahydrofuran or in ether, either in the cold or upon heating.</p>

  <p>The C-alkylation of indolylmagnesium iodide is particularly interesting in 
    comparison with other metal indole derivatives. We found that 2-phenylindolyl 
    sodium prepared from the indole and sodium hydride, did not react with &beta;-dimethylaminoethyl 
    chloride in anisole at -5�C, but at a higher temperature N-alkylation occurred<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> 
    and after 4 hours at 80�C 1-dimethylaminoethyl-2-phenylindole was obtained 
    in 70% conversion. The latter, which has not previously been reported, was 
    recrystallised from light petroleum to give needles having mp 64-66�C (hydrochloride, 
    needles, mp 223-224.5�C). Similar results were obtained in tetrahydrofuran 
    or dimethylformamide and in no case could the C-alkylated product be detected.</p>

  <p>The lithium derivative of 2-phenylindole was prepared by exchange with butyl 
    lithium in benzene, anisole was then added and most of the benzene was removed 
    by distillation. The reaction with &beta;-dimethylaminoethyl chloride for 
    4 hours at 84�C gave the N alkylated product in 23% conversion while at -5�C 
    for 8 hours less than 1% conversion was effected. In neither case was there 
    evidence of C-alkylation.</p>

  <p>The contrast between N-alkylation of the indolylsodium and C-alkylation of 
    the indolylmagnesium derivatives is interesting and the reduced nucleophilicity 
    of the indolic nitrogen of the magnesyl compound indicates that the nitrogen 
    is shielded from attack or is stabilised by co-ordination. If indolylmagnesium 
    and indolylsodium are essentially similar ionic species, as has been suggested 
    by Reinecke et al.<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>, our results imply that, 
    at least in anisole, the indolylmagnesium complex is not dissociated. If the 
    magnesium is associated with the indolic nitrogen then co-ordination of the 
    solvent to magnesium could provide effective shielding and so prevent N-alkylation. 
    Interpretation is complicated by the solvent effect whereby the reaction has 
    been favoured by anisole, the less basic ether.</p> <p>Further discussion of the mechanism is limited by the possibility that at least 
    two alkylating species may be present. For instance there is good evidence<a href="dmt.indole.grignard.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> 
    to support the view that &beta;-dimethylaminoethyl chloride, though formally 
    an alkyl halide, usually reacts with nucleophiles via the dimethylethylene-immonium 
    ion. The alkylation of indolylmagnesium at -5�C, but not at higher temperatures, 
    certainly implies a competing reaction.</p>

<h4>Indolylmagnesium bromide</h4>

<p>To 1.2 g of magnesium (99.99%), in 15 ml of dry THF, was slowly added 5.2 g of ethyl bromide in 10 ml of THF, 
without cooling but with vigorous stirring. After the reaction was completed 5.0 g of indole in 30 ml of dry 
THF was added. The liberated ethane was measured in an inverted graduated cylinder filled with water. The 
theoretical amount of ethane was collected in all cases. The indole Grignard reagent was completely soluble in THF.</p>

<h4>Indolyllithium</h4>

<p>Indolyllithium was prepared by adding 5.0 g of indole in 15 ml of THF to a refluxing mixture of 0.35 g of lithium hydride in 
45 ml of THF. The resulting mixture was refluxed for 10-15 hr. The indolyllithium thus formed appeared to be quite soluble.</p>

<h4>Indolylsodium</h4>

<p>A solution of 5.0 g of indole in 20 ml of dry THF was added to a mixture of 1 g of sodium hydride in 40 ml of refluxing THF. 
The mixture was heated under reflux for another 30-60 min.</p>
