Chem-R-Us NaGHB Synthesis:

If you follow this synthesis exactly as I have described, you will
always make pure NaGHB that is every bit as pure as the pharmaceutical
stuff that can be bought in sane countries.

You will need:

Clean dry beakers and graduated cylinders, a set of chemical scales,
narrow range pH strips for 5.5-8.0, a hot plate, and (if you intend
to make powder) two sealed tupperware containers, a blender and a pyrex
baking dish.

1) Accurately measure out gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) in the volume of 
milliliters (mls) you want to react.

Example: You want to react 200 mls of GBL.

2) Multiply this number by the average density of GBL (1.124 gms/ml).

Example: (200 mls GBL) * (1.124 gms/ml) = 224.8 gms GBL

3) Divide this number by the average molecular weight of GBL (86.06
gms/mol).

Example: (224.8 gms GBL) / (86.06 gms/mol) = 2.612 mols of GBL

4) Multiply this number by the average molecular weight of NaOH (40.0
gms/mol)

Example: (2.612 mols) * (40.0) = 104.5 gms NaOH

5) Weigh out this much NaOH using a set of chemical scales.

6) Heat the GBL + 5% distilled water (by volume) to 100 degrees C

Example: 200 mls GBL + 20 mls distilled water heated to 100C

7) Completely dissolve the NaOH in distilled water at the rate of about
40 grams per 100 mls of water.

Example: (104.5 gms NaOH) / (40) = 2.6125 * 100 mlw H2O = 260 mls water

8) *SLOWLY* drip (DO NOT POUR) 90% of the NaOH into the heated GBL
and make sure that the reaction is occurring (the solution will begin
boiling vigorously). If the reaction is not occuring, then you either
have not heated the GBL to 100C or you have defective reactants (throw
them out and get fresh stuff). Once the solution begins boiling, you
can turn the heat off - the reaction will make its own heat.

9) Begin measuring the pH of the reaction solution with narrow range pH
paper (5.0 - 8.0 paper). When the range begins to get to 7.5 to 8.0,
stop dripping the NaOH solution. This mixture will still have unreacted
lactone in it - so now it is time to do some steam distillation.

Steam Distillation (The purification step)

10) Put a thermometer in the solution capable of measuring 200C and
crank the heat up on the solution. You may want to add a boiling stone
made from a clean piece of pea gravel to the solution (don't use a
boiling stick because you will burn it up, and don't use a chemical
boiling stone because they contain metals that are not supposed to go
into humans).

11) When the solution gets up to 150-155C, cut the heat back enough to
hold the temperature steady at 150-155C. Hold it at that temperature
until all bubbling stops. The beaker now contains melted NaGHB.

12a) To make a liquid, add enough boiling water to make the dilution
you want.

Example: You want 1 gram NaGHB per 5 ml of solution. 200 mls of GBL
will make 329 grams NaGHB. 329 * 5 ml = 1645 mls of solution. So
add enough boiling water to bring the entire solution up to 1650 mls.

12b) To make powder, pour out thin strips of the NaGHB melt into the
pyrex casserole dish. Return the melt to the low heat to keep it
melted. Let the strips cool - they will begin to curl up if the strips
are about 1/2" to 1" in width. Scrape them up with a metal spatula and
put them into a sealed tupperware container. Pour out more strips and
repeat the procedure until you have used up all of the melt.

13) Let the strips in the tupperware container cool down and shake them
around a bit (while holding the lid tighly on). This will break up the
strips.

14) Put the boken up NaGHB pieces into a blender (no more than 1/3 full)
at high speed. You may have to shake the blender around a bit to make
sure everything is ground into powder. Pour the powder into a sealed
tupperware container.

15) You are done. Enjoy, and please don't do G and drive.
