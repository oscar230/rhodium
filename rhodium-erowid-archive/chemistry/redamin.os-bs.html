</p>

<b>Procedure</b>

</p>

<p>
Mixed 66.9g MeAm was with 67mL (67mL)
dH<sub>2</sub>O.  Mixed 39.6g NaOH with 119g
(119mL) dH<sub>2</sub>O, and cooled in ice bath.

</p>

<p>
Set up equipment, started cooling, added stir
bar.  Put 26.1g Al foil in RBF.  Added
most of the 423mL MeOH to the RBF, saving about 50mL to wash
out the ketone container.  About 140mg of
HgCl<sub>2</sub> was then added to the RBF and the whole
flask was swirled to mix the HgCl<sub>2</sub> into the MeOH.

</p>

<p>
Once the MeOH started bubbling (about 5 minutes after the
addition of the HgCl<sub>2</sub>), the cool NaOH solution
was slowly poured into the MeAm solution.  The
smell of MeAm gas was now very strong.  The
basified MeAm solution, and the 55.2g ketone were then
poured into the RBF.  The remaining MeOH was
swirled in the ketone flask and added to the RBF, and the
whole flask was swirled a few times to mix everything.

</p>

<p>
This reaction is nowhere near as exothermic as a Methyl Man
Al/Hg Nitromethane.  The fact that 55g of ketone
(~300mmol) can be comfortably converted in a 1L flask says
it all.

</p>

<p>
Stirring was attempted, but the bar would not move, probably
due to the Al foil weighing it down.  Different
stirrers were tried, but to no avail.  During the
reflux the solution was bubbling quite well, but was still
diligently swirled a couple times every five
minutes.  After the reflux subsided, the flask
was swirled approximately every 15 minutes.  When
a top layer of clear fluid started forming, that means it's
time to swirl.

</p>

<p>
The temperature rose quickly to about 72�C with lots of foil
floating on the top, and lots of bubbles were evolving, but
it stayed in control.  This is with all the
ketone added at once.  See below for a full
temperature readout.

</p>

<p>
The reaction was left to run for 4.5 hours, and began to
calm down after about 45 minutes from the addition of the
ketone.  When it calms down a bit, prepare the
basification solution (230g 85% KOH added to 469mL
dH<sub>2</sub>O) to give it time to cool.  Heat
was added to the RBF after about 75 minutes to get the
temperature up to about 65�C.

</p>

<p>
Once the reaction is deemed finished, (there isn't really an
indicator to look for, just when enough time has elapsed)
strain/filter out any unreacted foil chunks.  In
this case, a large amount was left, probably about 8g, if
dry.  The foil in the strainer was rinsed with
about 50mL dH<sub>2</sub>O which was added to the reaction
contents in a 2L beaker.

</p>

<p>
The mixture was slowly basified by pouring the KOH solution
into reaction contents, and was stirred on a stirrer for
about 10 minutes.  Some bubbling was observed as
any remaining foil was reduced.  The mixture was
extracted with 1x 500mL, 1x 200mL fresh toluene by pouring
the toluene into the beaker and continuing
stirring.  After separating the extractions were
combined. The toluene started out clear, water-white, and
after the extractions was slightly cloudy and slightly
coloured.

</p>

<p>

The combined toluene extracts were washed with 3x 700mL
dH<sub>2</sub>O, 1x 700mL brine (saturated
NaCl).  Most of the cloudiness cleared up after
the washes.  The toluene was dried in 40g dried
MgSO<sub>4</sub> for 10 minutes.

</p>

<p> The toluene was then gassed, and filtered 4
times.  Even though the crystals were as white as
has been ever seen, the crystals were put into some boiling
acetone and filtered again.

</p>

<p> Total yield after acetone cleaning: 51.1g (92.4% w/w)

</p>

<p> Anyone want some Nitromethane?

<b>Notes</b><br>
[1] made by buffered performic, double distilled, measured a
hair under 44mL, had light pale green tint... used up
remaining amount, so it was a bit over what was called
for<br>

[2] made by chromic's method, as written up on the Hive<br>

[3] properly nuggetized<br>

[4] not enough NaOH (needed 200g) was available to basify
the mixture, so enough 85% KOH flakes were used to
compensate
