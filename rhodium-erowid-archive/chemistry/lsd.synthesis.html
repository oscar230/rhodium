<h3>   Kaff         (posted 05-16-98) </h3>
                <p>It just occurred to me that noone ever mentions acid. I
                have Fester's book Practical LSD Manufacture but that's
                about as practical as buying a wheat farm just to make
                acid. Yeah right Hawaiin Baby woodrose seeds and morning
                glory seeds have some lysergic acid, but why aren't there
                any new methods?</p>

<h3>drone 342    (posted 05-16-98) </h3>

                <p>I agree, Fester's LSD book was a major disappointment --
                yet one more reason to loath the guy. There is an
                advancement, one which Fester didn't include, which is
                the use of POCl<sub>3</sub> as a dehydrating reagent in the
                condensation of lysergic acid with diethylamine. Check
                out Rhodium's page, as well as hyperreal for more info on
                this new developement.</p>

<p>                The wierdest part about it is that it was developed by
                our friends over at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland
                during the mid-seventies -- the good people who lead the
                world in cutting-edge chemical warfare technology and
                supply the intelligence community with all the wierd shit
                they use. These are the same folks who stockpiled QNB in
                multi-kilo quantities right into the eighties, as well as
                the freaky things they don't tell anyone about. Some day,
                I want a tour of that place.</p>

                <p>Anyways, the important thing to keep in mind, which
                really shows yet again how much Fester talks out of his
                ass, is that all the seeds, fungi, and other biomass is
                NOT the way to allocate your lysergic compounds for this
                reaction. Anybody who makes it on a big scale is using
                most liekely ergot alkaloids from a commercial source --
                foreign pharmacy companies, etc. Its not that hard to get
                your hands on an ounce or two of ergotamine or ergonovine
                if you put your noggin to it. Hell, even bromocryptine
                will work (remove the bromine by maing the grignard out
                of it, then hydrolyzing it. As long as its done gently,
                no funky additions, olgermizations or whatever, will
                happen.)</p>

                <p>I've been waiting for someone to bring this subject up.
               Ask and you shall recieve.</p>

                <p>Whats wrong with Hawaiin Baby Woodrose? When your making
    something where 1 dose=50 micrograms a pound of HWBR goes
    a long ways... Does fester talk about culturing as a
    source in an incubator?</p>
  
<h3>Fan of Shulgin     (posted 05-17-98)</h3> 
    <p>IMHO culturing the ergot fungus in the best method by far
    for producing LSD. Even someone with absolutely no
    knowledge of microbiology can culture ergot. And as to
    obtaining the fungus, it can be found in most large
    fields of rye. This is no joke, wait just until harvest
    time and go out and have a look for the 'heads'. The
    beauty of growing the Claviceps is that you can keep it
    alive for ever if you are careful, and thus have an
    almost never ending supply of raw material.</p>
  
  <p>It is worth noting, that this is the method that most
    illegal acid labs operate (look up operation Julie in the
    UK!). Even producing acid on a small scale requires you
    to prepare shit loads of the precursors, because even
    working under red light at low temperatures and low
    humidity does not have that great an effect on keeping
    yields high (a 20% yield in LSD manufacture is considered
    a great success). Remember LSD is inherantly unstable!</p>
  
<p>  Anyway - LSD synthesis, Claviceps cultivation etc are one
    of the most talked about drug manufacturing methods on
    the net. Have a good long search around!</p>

 <p>                 I'm telling you guys, mushroom cultivation IS NOT where
                  its at! As far as I can tell, this is not as common of a
                  procedure as people believe. Why? Ever look at the amount
                  of solvents entailed in extracting the stuff? This is a
                  way too involved process that uses far too many
                  resources. MAYBE there's some lab that does this, but
                  it's just not practical. Besides, this bioproduction
                  entails the chemist mastering a whole bunch more skills
                  than the tricky ones already required.</p>
  
<p>                I stand by my procedure as THE ONE TRUE WAY(tm), or at
                  least the best of the one true ways. Think about it:
                  Bromocryptine into bromolysergic acid. Bromolysergic acid
                  into bromolysergic acid diethylamide. Bromolsyergic acid
                  diethylamide into its respective grignard reagent.
                  Grignard reagent decomposition into LSD. Add a dash of
                  tartaric acid, and chromatograph it. All pretty simple
                  procedures -- relatively speaking.</p>
  
<p>                Bromocryptine is easy to get in reasonable quantities.
                  Other ergot alkaloids are also available, and would alow
                  the chemist to skip a debromination step or two as well.</p>
  
<p>                While some believe that LSD is only worthwhile on a
                  mega-huge scale of ounces at a time, I contend that using
                  the sources I suggest, that a gram-size batch would still
                  be a very attractive endevor.</p>
  
<p>                HBWR seeds might be a decent way to go, I agree, but I
                  prefer pill extracting any day. Considering also the
                  price and notriousness of this as a source, other sources
                  should be investigated more thotoughly. How much does a
                  kilo of seeds go for nowadays?</p>
  
<p>                Still, here's another source. Grain companies have a lot
                  of fancy-shmancy equiptment I've been told, soley to
                  remove claviceps from our food supply. This means that
                  every harvest season, your local grain elevator has got
                  pounds of ergot-ladden grain that they normally throw
                  away. This I heard from a friend of mine who worked in a
                  grain elevator -- lost contact with him since my chemical
                  skills were upgraded. This is worth some investigating.</p>
  
<p>                Anyways, I agree that far too little research is being
                  done into these matters, and I'd like to see more
                  discussion of the chemistry of Hoffmann's baby. The
                  chemistry IS above kitchen production conditions, but not
                  out of reach for the semi-elite of The Hive's Chemical
                  Guard. By eliminating the riduculous, over-complicated
                  bullshit procedures out there, and replacing them with
                  simpler, more practical means, the small circle of people
                  willing-and-able to perform this most sacred of chemistry
                  is widended considerably.</p>

<p>Drone, c'mon, we are not talking about mushrooms here, wake up son... Mushrooms growing right on top of rye
plants, that would look prety silly.. All you need is a sample, some .2% agar plates and some sterile technique,
not exactly skill-requiring stuff..</p>

<p><strong>KrZ:</strong></p>
  
<p>Sorry, I suffer from a mild case of irony deficiency, and so its hard for me to tell when folks are pulling my leg.
I wholeheartedly aprove of and endorse mushroom cultivation -- provided it is of my favorite basidiomycetes genus that starts with the letter "p".</p>
  
<p>However, I think you'll discover claviceps is harder than you think. Ever try to get a pure culture of that stuff?
If you go through any of the research collections or biotech companies, you're going to have to fill out more
paperwork than you'd believe -- not because its laden with ergot goodness, but because its considered a
agriculturally harmful organism. It's about as involved as filling out forms for the purchasing of an
encapsulating machine. If you choose to isolate your own strain from the field, good luck. You got a 2-month or so
window of time to collect it, and then comes the isolation process. Then once you have pure claviceps,
you're going to have to isolate a decent-producing heterokaryote from your collection, which you may or may
not have. Once you manage THAT, then comes the petri dish phase, followed by the initial submerged culture for
producing seed stock, then finally the large-scale submerged culture to yield a a sludge of filaments you
gotta strain out, dry, then extract.</p>
  
<p>Yuck. There are a lot of professional folks out there who's entire days, nay, entire <strong>careers</strong> relovle around
ergot production. I rather rely on the fruits of their labor and save all the schmassle that this project would otherwise entail.</p>
  
<p>Think about it. I honestly feel the main detractor from more people producing LSD is this ergot culturing myth.
Yeah, everyone says "<em>Boy, I sure wish I could make some good acid. All I gotta do is get a chemistry degree under
my belt, get a good lab space, and on top of that, raise a culture of some fucked-up saprophytic fungus that'll
give me gangrene in the process.</em>" This is obviously daunting. If you disagree and say its not too much of a
bother, then why aren't more people kicking out kilos of "L"? What I'm proposing is that this fungus cultivation
idea is more of a detriment to acid production than an advantage. Just extract the shit from pills, or go to the
third world where the stuff is cheap, and you can buy it in its straight uncut powder form for pharmaceutical
outlets (there are several countries where you can do this when you know a good pharmacist and have the cake to
do some bribing; believe me, I've looked.)</p>
  
<p>As simple as ergot cultivation sounds, there's plenty of reasons its not done commonly.</p>
  
<h3>drone 342 (posted 05-18-98)</h3> 
<p>Oh yeah, and I almost forgot. With bromocriptine, you can do that grignard degredation process as your first couple
steps; this wil cut down on the amounts of POCl<sub>3</sub> and Et<sub>2</sub>N required in the amidation and save you precious
resources. Grignards don't readily add to amides, so you can take advantage of that.</p>
 
<h3>drone 342 (posted 05-20-98)</h3>
<p>Okay, so of available precursors for acid, we got:</p>
  
<ul>
	<li><span class="oli">HBWR</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Ipomoea sp.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Claviceps sp.</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Ergot alkaloid pills (ergotamine, ergonovine, etc.)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">bromocriptine</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">a few other misc. plants</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems to me the chemistry and methodology is pretty cut-and-dry -- the main problem is precursor aquisition.
So what other exciting sources might be out there for the ergoloid ring?</p>

<p>                  Yeah, looks like (according to that Journal of the AOAC
                  article) Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose is 0.04 to 0.30 % LSA,
                  by weight.</p>
  
<h3>   drone 342    (posted 05-20-98) </h3>
<p>                  Incidentally, I looked into the possible utilization of
                  sleepy grass, butit looked like it was full of all sorts
                  of other alkaloid garbage aside from lisergic acid and
                  its amides. Chanoclavines, Pyridines, etc. This might be
                  a good source if anybody knows a good way of separating
                  the wheat from the chaff in this case. What else besides
                  HPLC will do the trick? (I have an HPLC machine for my
                  amusement, but I can only do tiny volumes; besides, half
                  the point of this research is figuring out ways of doing
                  this kind of stuff successfully garage-style rather than
                  just in the lab.)</p>
  
<p>                Also, does anybody else harbor the same loathing for
                  Fester and his piece-o-shit-excuse-for-an-acid-book as I
                  do? I mean, he completely missed the POCl<sub>3</sub> method, and
                  left "method X" a mystery (even though its probobly just
                  as full of shit as the rest of the book.) In addition, he
                  mistakenly thought propionic anhydride had something to
                  do with acid chemistry, and then didn't even give a
                  particularily meaningful synthesis for it. All his
                  methods looked like rehashes of patents from the earlier
                  part of this century (available in half a dozen other
                  publications already,) and the only lysergic acid source
                  he offers is buying a goddam wheat farm and raising a
                  crop of moldy rye grain! Even his claviceps raising would
                  take over a year to accomplish!</p>
  
<p>                So, his book only would be practical for a farmer with a
                  couple years on his hands, a few 55-gallon barrels of
                  tech-grade solvents, a lab full of large-scale equiptment
                  for advanced organic chemical procedures, and some rather
                  extensive training in organic chemistry. If a person had
                  all those resources available to them at the same time,
                  they'd be an idiot if they couldn't find a better way of
                  going about things than that.</p>

<p>                  I haven't looked over it a great deal but, the book
                  <a href="psychedelicchemistry/index.html">Psychedelic Chemistry</a> by Michael Valentine Smith gives
                  detailed info on lysergic acid and extractions for ergot
                  extraction from HBWS and states that the seeds yield 7mg
                  alkaloids/100 g of seeds and that thru the usual steps to
                  reach the end point of lsd that you get roughly 1g LSD /
                  kg of seed. the book can be ordered from <a href="http://www.loompanics.com">Loompanics</a>.</p>
  
<h3>   drone 342    (posted 05-20-98) </h3>

<p>                  Got a copy of that one already; what library would be
                  complete without MVS's book? Nothing too
                  earth-shattering, but still I like it; there's an aura of
                  honesty to it that you don't see in many other
                  underground drug books. MVS is sure no formally-trained
                  chemist, but at least he knew how to operate a copying
                  machine and give credit where it was due.</p>
  
<p>                Your numbers don't add up.
                  (7mg ergot/100g HBWR)�(1000g/1kg) does not equal even 1g of
                  ergot, but I get the general gist of it. I'll give it a
                  look-see. Thanks for the tip. Considering that a kilo can
                  be boughten for around $300-$400 dollars, it looks like
                  it would almost be a good investment (I prefer the
                  chemistry of drugs where the profit margin is closer to
                  95-99% rather a mere 75-80%, but hey, its acid.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-5.htm">LSD Manufacture: Illegal LSD Production</a></strong></p> 

<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD has been manufactured illegally since the 1960's. A
                  limited number of chemists, probably less than a dozen,
                  are believed to be manufacturing nearly all of the LSD
                  available in the United States. Some of these manufacturers
                  probably have been operating since the 1960's.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>LSD manufacturers and traffickers can be separated into
                  two groups. The first, located in northern California, is
                  composed of chemists (commonly referred to as 'cooks') and
                  traffickers who work together in close association; typically,
                  they are major producers capable of distributing LSD
                  nationwide. The second group is made up of independent
                  producers who, operating on a comparatively limited scale,
                  can be found throughout the country. As a group, independent
                  producers pose much less of a threat than the northern
                  California group inasmuch as their production is intended
                  for local consumption only.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Drug law enforcement officials have surmised that LSD
                  chemists and top echelon traffickers form an insider's
                  fraternity of sorts. They successfully have remained at
                  large because there are so few of them. Their exclusivity
                  is not surprising given that LSD synthesis is a difficult
                  process to master. Although cooks need not be formally
                  trained chemists, they must adhere to precise and complex
                  production procedures. In instances where the cook is not
                  a chemist, the production recipe most likely was passed on
                  by personal instruction from a formally trained chemist.
                  Further supporting the premise that most LSD manufacture is
                  the work of a small fraternity of chemists, virtually all
                  the LSD seized during the 1980's was of consistently high
                  purity and sold in relatively uniform dosages of 20 to 80
                  micrograms.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>LSD commonly is produced from lysergic acid, which is
                  made from ergotamine tartrate, a substance derived from
                  an ergot fungus on rye, or from lysergic acid amide, a
                  chemical found in morning glory seeds. Although
                  theoretically possible, manufacture of LSD from morning glory
                  seeds is not economically feasible and these seeds never
                  have been found to be a successful starting material for
                  LSD production. Lysergic acid and lysergic acid amide are
                  both classified in Schedule III of the Controlled Substances
                  Act. Ergotamine tartrate is regulated under the Chemical
                  Diversion and Trafficking Act.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Ergotamine tartrate is not readily available in the
                  United States, and its purchase by other than established
                  pharmaceutical firms is suspect. Therefore, ergotamine
                  tartrate used in clandestine LSD laboratories is believed
                  to be acquired from sources located abroad, most likely
                  Europe, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Africa. The difficulty
                  in acquiring ergotamine tartrate may limit the number of
                  independent LSD manufacturers. By contrast, illicit
                  manufacture of methamphetamine and phencyclidine is
                  comparatively more prevelant in the United States because,
                  in part, precursor chemicals can be procured easily.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Only a small amount of ergotamine tartrate is required to
                  produce LSD in large batches. For example, 25 kilograms
                  of ergotamine tartrate can produce 5 or 6 kilograms of pure
                  LSD crystal that, under ideal circumstances, could be
                  processed into 100 million dosage units, more than enough to
                  meet what is believed to be the entire annual U.S. demand
                  for the hallucinogen. LSD manufacturers need only import a
                  small quantity of the substance and, thus, enjoy the advantages
                  of ease of concealment and transport not available to
                  traffickers of other illegal drugs, primarily marijuana
                  and cocaine.
  </em></p>  
               <p><em> Cooking LSD is time consuming; it takes from 2 to 3 days
                  to produce 1 to 4 ounces of crystal. Consequently, it is
                  believed that LSD usually is not produced in large
                  quantities, but rather in a series of small batches.
                  Production of LSD in small batches also minimizes the loss of
                  precursor chemicals should they become contaminated during
                  the synthesis process.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>LSD crystal produced clandestinely can be as much as 95-100-percent pure. At this purity - and assuming optimum
                  conditions during dilution and application to paper - 1 gram
                  of crystal could produce 20,000 dosage units of LSD.
                  However, analysis of LSD crystal seized in California over
                  the past 3 years revealed an average purity of only 62
                  percent. Moreover, LSD degrades quickly when exposed to
                  heat, light, and air and is most susceptible to degradation
                  during the application process and once it is in paper form.
                  As a result, under less than optimal, real-life conditions,
                  actual yields are significantly below the theoretically
                  possible yield: 1 gram of LSD crystal genarally yields
                  10,000 dosage units of LSD, or approximately 10 million
                  dosage units per kilogram.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Over the past 30 years, the traditional dilution factor
                  for manufacturing LSD has been 10,000 doses per 1 gram of
                  crystal. Therefore, dosage units yielded from high-purity
                  (95-100-percent pure) LSD crystal would contain 100
                  micrograms. However, dosages currently seen contain closer
                  to 50 micrograms. This discrepancy stems in part from
                  production impurities: during the sythesis process,
                  manufacturers generally fail to perform a final 'clean-up'
                  step to remove by-products, thereby lowering the crystal's
                  purity. Further, though average purity of tested LSD crystal
                  samples is, as noted, 62 percent, the average potency of
                  doses analyzed is approximately 50 micrograms rather than 62
                  micrograms, as would be expected. The diminished potency
                  can be attributed to distributors who, when applying the
                  crystal to paper, often 'cheat' by diluting 1 gram of
                  crystal to produce up to 15,000 or more dosage units.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Pure, high-potency LSD is a clear or white, odorless
                  crystalline material that is soluble in water. It is
                  mixed with binding agents, such as spray-dried skim milk,
                  for producing tablets or is dissolved and diluted in a
                  solvent for application onto paper or other materials.
                  Variations in the manufacturing process or the presence of
                  precursors or by-products can cause LSD to range in color
                  from clear or white, in its purest form, to tan or even
                  black, indicating poor quality or degradation. To mask
                  product difficiencies, distributors often apply LSD to
                  off-white, tan, or yellow paper to disguise discoloration.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>At the highest levels of the traffic, where LSD crystal
                  is purchased in gram or multigram quantities from wholesale
                  sources of supply, it rarely is diluted with adulterants, a
                  common practice with cocaine, heroin, and other illicit
                  drugs. However, to prepare the crystal for production in
                  retail dosage units, it must be diluted with binding agents
                  or dissolved and diluted in liquids. The dilution of LSD
                  crystal typically follows a standard, predetermined recipe
                  to ensure uniformity of the final product. Excessive dilution
                  yields less potent dosage units that soon become unmarketable.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>LSD crystal usually is converted into tablet form ('microdots'
                  that are 3/32 inch or smaller in diameter), thin squares of
                  gelatin ('window panes'), or applied to sheets of prepared
                  paper (blotter paper-initially used as a medium-has been
                  replaced by a variety of paper types). LSD most frequently
                  is encountered in paper form, still commonly referred to as
                  blotter paper or blotter acid. It consists of sheets of paper
                  soaked in or otherwise impregnated with LSD. Often these
                  sheets are covered with colorful designs or artwork and
                  are usually perforated into one-quarter inch square,
                  individual dosage units.</em></p>

                  be seen on the medium. Large-scale production of the fungus
                  can now begin.</em></p>
  
                <p><em>Obtain several ordinary 1 gallon jugs. Place a two-hole
                  stopper in the necks of the jugs. Fit a short (6 inch)
                  glass tube in one hole, leaving 2 inches above the stopper.
                  Fit a short rubber tube to this. Fill a small (500
                  milliliter) Erlenmeyer flask with a dilute solution of
                  sodium hypochlorite, and extend a glass tube from the rubber
                  tube so the end is immersed in the hypochlorite. Fit a long,
                  glass tube in the other stopper hole. It must reach near
                  the bottom of the jug and have about two inches showing
                  above the stopper. Attach a rubber tube to the glass tube as
                  short or as long as desired, and fit a short glass tube to
                  the end of the rubber tube. Fill a large, glass tube (1 inch
                  x 6 inches) with sterile cotton and fit 1-hole stoppers in
                  the ends. Fit the small, glass tube in end of the rubber
                  tube into 1 stopper of the large tube. Fit another small
                  glass tube in the other stopper. A rubber tube is connected
                  to this and attached to a small air pump obtained from a

                  down to the bottom of the Erlenmeyer flask and up through
                  the sodium hypochlorite solution into the atmosphere. With
                  this aeration equipment you can assure a supply of clean air
                  to the Claviceps purpurea fungus while maintaining a sterile
                  atmosphere inside the solution.</em></p>

                  grass is by far the best choice. The ergot will appear as a
                  blackish growth on the tops of the rye where the seeds are
                  and are referred to as "heads of ergot." From these heads

                  from the ergot, free from contamination, and used to
                  inoculate the culture media. The need for absolute sterility
                  cannot be overstressed. Consult any elementary text on

                  <p><strong>Fan of Shulgin:</strong> I checked out the '<em>Operation Julie</em>' book
                  and it says that the Ergot compounds were ALL bought.
                  Initially by simply driving to Switzerland and paying
                  cash (those were the days!) and later using fake
                  companies and from underground sources (Brotherhood of
                  Eternal Love with Leary et all).</p>
                  <p>I have never read of any large LSD manufacturers making
                  there own. It is quite a skill & is quite dangerous
                  (ergot IS classed as a poison, do you like your
                  extremeties? Do you want them to go black and drop off?
                  Don't try growing ergot without knowing the safety rules)</p>

                <p>Ergot compounds appear in certain prescription migraine
                  medications (all made by Sandoz, fancy that!)</p>
  
                <p>The book '<em>Operation Julie</em>' has a few pictures of the
                  chemistry setup. It was pretty involved stuff. One small
                  hilight was a brown bottle featured slap-bang in the
                  middle of one picture. It said 'NaNO<sub>2</sub>'. Fester says that
                  this 'might' be a replacement for acetyl-acetone. It is.
                  THAT was the Method-X bit. It's not even a secret.</p>

                <p>What about using DCC as your dehydrating reagent for
                  forming an amide bond? High yields and low temps means

<p><strong>Re</strong>: Claviceps. That doesn't sound like too good of a deal. Do they have better prices when you buy in bulk?
Even at half the price, that really isn't too good a deal. Considering the tiny percentage of ergot alkaloids
in a gram, then considering how much less you have after hydrolyzing off those useless peptides, and how much less
you have still after the dehydration of the acid with ethylamine, ten dollars is way more than street prices.
This isn't even counting in labor as a cost (most chemists I know like to get paid.)</p>

reiterating what you stated but I think the best way to go about this would be to hydrolyze off the peptide
garbage leaving bromo lysergic acid and then subject this to Grignard's reaction. I think the appropriate time to
form the amide is after the Grignard because a carboxyl group will probably be less reactive than an amide group
towards the Grignard.</p>

<p>Yes, Grignard will work wonders in this case, and no, it
                  actually is easy to get it to do it. All that multicyclic
                  studd simply doesn't appeal to the grignard substituent
                  - it's looking for an electron-deficient site labile and
                  with nowhere to run to. Amides are surpisingly sturdy to
                  these condsitions, and will not readily react at all. As
                  far as I see it, that would really be the only concern
                  (regarding the carbonyls found therin.)The reason for
                  this is that the nitrogen is electron donating, whereas
                  in any other carbonyl, it doesn't have this luxury, and
                  will react readliy with a Grignard. Conditions are a
                  snap, just a nice dry ether soultion or Benzene solution
                  (with light being thoroughly eliminatined from the
                  envronment around the flask) of the free base of your
                  ergot caompound in question will do. If you're still
                  worried about that reaction affecting the peptide, just
                  save it for the last step - make bromo-LSD, then do it.
                  I guaruntee that the amide will be safe.</p>

<p>Thank you. This is the useful type of information we need buckets of if we want to end the war on drugs 
(my strategy: an all-out assault; a psychedelic blitzkrieg. Hey, now that's a catchy phrase!)</p>

<p><strong>Fan of Shulgin</strong>,</p>  
<p>Where can you get a living 1-gram clean specimen of claviceps purpurea? Are you sure its alive? How do you
know this works, or is this strictly speculation?</p>
  
<p><strong>Josh</strong>,</p>
  
<p>Tell you what; I'll give the ref's, and anybody with the resources to actually perform this should also 
have plenty of access to the library. Actually, all you need is a copy of a decent lab manual describing the 
synthesis of grignard reagents, and follow the general guidelines for producing a Grignard intermediate. Then, 
add water. You now have ergocriptine. Hydrolyze it and condense with diethylamine according to the proceedures 
listed in TiHKAL.</p>
  
<p>Alternatively, one could use DCC. From the <strong>Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Typically, DCC (1.1 equiv) is added to a concentrated solution (0.1-1.0M) of the carboxylic acid (1.0 equiv),
amine (1.0 equiv), and catalyst (when used) in methylene chloride or acetonitrile at 0&deg;C. The hydrated DCC
adduct, dicyclohexylurea (DCU), quickly precipitates and the reaction is generally complete within 1 h at rt..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
  
<p>Downsides: THF and DMF screw things up by slowing things down and ecouraging the production of side-products, as
well as racemizing the carboxylic acid. The other downside is in some solvents, a trace of DCU can disolve
in with your product, requiring purification (nothing flash chromatography wouldn't take care of quite easily,
which you have to do anyways if you want to be a good person.)</p>

<h3>   Piglet       (posted 05-26-98)</h3>
<p><strong>Fan Of Shulgin:</strong> When I typed about the dangers of ergot, I meant to to guy producing it. The actual amount of
ergot needed to produce 'St. Antonys Fire' immediately seem quite low. It was estimated from the last outbreaks
(after WW2 when people were starving and would eat ANYTHING including infested rye) that about 30mg causes
SEVERE reactions. I know you would never ingest such amounts of ANY substence in a lab, but growing your own
ergot is not a lab technique. I did check out that old chestnut about growing in culture. Most of the
researchers had little success. I think it CAN be produced in culture, but only by someone who REALLY knows
there stuff. Sandoz grow rye to this day!</p>
  
<h3>drone 342    (posted 06-10-98)</h3>
<p>Piglet, where did you get this information about Sandoz? As far as I know, Claviceps is one of those organisms
that researchers have spent a lot of time, money, and energy in getting it to grow in submerged culture on a
large scale -- and have come up with a successful means of doing so. I've heard some similar things in
publications from times past, but I suspect that in modern industry, the transition has been made.</p>
  
<h3>Cherrie Baby   (posted 06-11-98)</h3>
<p><em> "Where can you get a living 1-gram clean specimen of claviceps purpurea?"</em></p>
  
<p>During late summer have a look at the Rye grass in the local park. You'll notice a purple-brown "ear" growing on
the rye seeds - this stuff is Claviceps purpurea. It grows in my back garden. If you have some experience with
shrooms this is easy to grow. The big catch is that nearly all the LSA producing ergot has been from particular strains 
which you'll have to get from a lab that stocks pure cultures. I don't think wild ergot would work when making LSA's. 
I've been told that you can grow the ergot (easily) but it won't make LSA unless it's the right strain!</p>
  
<p>Are there any biochemists out there who know the answer to this one way or another?</p>
  

<h3>  Forest Gump (Posted Dec. 24, 1997)</h3>
  
<p>The book that you refer to "<strong>Practical LSD Manufacture</strong>" by <em>Uncle Fester</em>, now in
  its 2nd Ed. isn't completely about LSD, although from the title one could get
  that impression. The first edition contianed 115 pages, of which only about 70
  pages actually had anything to do with LSD synthesis, the rest mostly about
  Fester's pet project: TMA-2 synthesis. The second edition contains 142 pages,
  almost all the extra pages going to his pet project -- which now consumes about
  halve the book -- while the LSD portion remains virtually unchanged (all the
  errors and mistakes of the first edition were remarkably well preserved into
  the second). A naive person could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking the book
  of being just a vehicle for his pet project -- but of course we know better.</p>
  
<p>Before I list just some of those errors let me preface it with this: it is
  obvious that not only does Fester not have any practical experience with
  Lysergic chemistry, but that he is also confused by it.</p>
  
<ol>
	<li><span class="oli"><strong>Isomer Confusion.</strong> In chapter 4 Fester makes repeated mistakes as to
  chirality. On page 24, in reference to the anhydrous hydrazine degradation
  method, he tells us that this procedure produces very little iso- compound,
  when in fact it produces predominately iso- material. On page 25 he informs
  us of the importance of maintaining anhydrous conditions to avoid getting
  racemic product -- on further reading it is obvious that by "racemic" he
  means iso/normal mixtures, as nowhere is there to be found any reference
  to the l (levo) compound.
  
<br>
<br>The older hydrazine hydrate method produced a 1/1 mixture of d and l compounds;
  the l compounds are inactive and represent a total loss, as there is no
  convenient method to convert them into the desired d compound. The anhydrous
  hydrazine method is a newer improvement upon this which avoids the l compound,
  but it still gives about 2/3 of the iso- compound which is also inactive; 2/3
  inactive product sounds real bad, but it's not nearly as bad as the older
  method because the iso- compound is easily isomerized into the active compound
  in about 2/3 yield. When Hofmann refers to this new method as not producing any
"racemic" material what he means is that it doesn't produce any of the useless
  l compound, not that it doesn't produce iso- compound.
  
<br><br>Also, the amidation procedure he gives in the same chapter produces some iso-
  compound, although nowhere does he mention that. Indeed, from reading the
  purifacation procedure, he seems to think that this amidation method also
  preserves chirality.</span></li>
<br><br>  
	<li><span class="oli"><strong>Continuum Error.</strong> The first paragraph on page 27 (i.e., "<em>Both of these
  choices are really very poor, ...</em>") picks up from nowhere, and we're left to
  wonder what he's refering to. Chalk this one up to bad proofreading (this is
  Loompanics we're talking about after all).</span></li>
<br><br>
	<li><span class="oli"><strong>Outdated Methods.</strong> The four amidation methods in the book have long since
  been superseded by the phosphorus oxychloride in chloroform method, which is
  not in the book.</span></li>
<br><br>  
	<li><span class="oli"><strong>Method X.</strong> In the book a big deal is made about his erroneous discovery of
  a "superior" LSD method which he calls "method x". I'll spare you all the
  convoluted details and inane logic of how he came about this "discovery" except
  for this one statement of his: "<em>Note that propionic anhydride is a listed
  chemical under the Chemical Diversion Act, with a reporting threshold of 1 gram.
  There is only one substance in the field of clandestine drug manufacture where
  1 gram is a significant amount -- LSD</em>"</span></li>
</ol>  


<p>I'm sure not a few DEA chemists must have laughed there ass off after having
  read that. Propionic anhydride is used to make fentanyl and its analogues.
  Some fentanyl analogues are 10 times more potent than LSD!!!!</p>
  
<p>And that is just some of the errors contained within that book. And with that
  I'll leave you, hopefully a little bit more knowlegable.</p>

  
<h3>FX (Posted Dec. 25, 1997):</h3>
  
<p>Hey, thanks a lot. You seem to know quite a bit about LSD chemistry. I'm sure
  that Fester's book has some errors, but I am not aware of any other book in
  existence on practical LSD manufacture. Are you? It is amazing how few people
  know anything about LSD synth, apparently it is the hardest recreational drug
  to manufacture of them all, much much harder than ectacy or meth. Why is this?
  How should someone go about learning about LSD manufacture assuming that they
  don't have PhDs in chemistry? According to DEA, almost all of the LSD made in
  the United States is made but just a handful of chemists in california! Can
  you believe that? A half a dozen people make amost 100 million hits per year,
  and they have been doing it since the 1960s! This almost blows the mind!</p>
  
<h3>Forest Gump (Posted Dec. 25, 1997):</h3>
  
<p>Below are all the books that are in print that I know of which contain LSD synthesis procedures:
   
</p>
<ul> 
		<li><span class="oli"><strong>The Anarchist Cookbook</strong>, <em>William Powell</em> (1971)</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><strong>The Book of Acid</strong>, <em>Adam Gottlieb</em> (1975)</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><a href="psychedelicchemistry/index.html">Psychedelic Chemistry</a>, <em>Michael V. Smith</em> (2nd Ed., 1981)</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><a href="lsd-buzz.html">Recreational Drugs</a>, <em>Prof. Buzz</em> (1989)</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><strong>Practical LSD Manufacture</strong>, <em>Uncle Fester</em> (2nd Ed., 1997)</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.html">TIHKAL: The Continuation</a>, <em>Alexander Shulgin</em> (1997)</span></li>
</ul>
  
<p>So, which ones do I recomend for someone serious about LSD chemistry? Well,
  all of them! But not for the reasons you might think at first.</p>
  
<p>Most of these books contain serious errors. The Anarchist Cookbook for example
  has a method of "Making LSD in the kitchen" which is incorrect of course,
  although it does give an accurate procedure which is merely a reprint of the
  first part of Pioch's patent method. The Book of Acid calls to use sodium
  nitrate in one method, when in fact it is sodium nitrite which is used in that
  procedure. Recreational Drugs doesn't really contain anything that wasn't already
  in Psychedelic Chemistry, although it does give an incorrect LSD structure. All
  these books can go a long way in developing one's critical faculties though --
  which is an important attribute for an LSD researcher to have, considering the
  B.S. factor that surrounds LSD.</p>
  
<p>So, which of these books do I think are the most important to have?
  All the books listed below, in order of importance:</p>
  
<ol>
		<li><span class="oli"><a href="psychedelicchemistry/index.html">Psychedelic Chemistry</a></span></li> 
		<li><span class="oli"><strong>Practical LSD Manufacture</strong></span></li>
		<li><span class="oli"><a href="http://de1.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.html">TIHKAL</a></span></li>
</ol>
  
<p>Again, not for all the obvious reasons. Number 1 and 2 contain many journal
  references, and so can be a good step-off point to the real gold mine: the
  chemical journals at your nearest university science library. TIHKAL and #1
  both have the most up-to-date method, although that's the only method TIHKAL has.</p>
  
<p>Believe it or not, you can probably start learning about LSD chemistry right
  now if you have a chemistry text-book or are near any library. Just look-up the
  following (numbered in order of importance):</p>
  
<ol>
		<li><span class="oli">carboxyl group;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">carboxylic acids;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">amides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">amines;</span></li>
</ol>  

<p>also, look-up:</p>

<ul>  
		<li><span class="oli">acid halides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">anhydrides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">mixed anhydrides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">hydrazides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">azides;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">azoles;</span></li>
		<li><span class="oli">esters;</span></li>
</ul>
  
<p>and of course, alkaloids.</p>
  
<p>You see, LSD is an amide. LSD is usually made from lysergic acid which is a
  carboxylic acid and diethylamine which is an amine. Lysergic acid is in turn
  usually made by degradation of an amide, such as ergotamine.</p>
  
<p>All of these procedures involve the changing of one functional group: the
  carboxyl group. A good LSD chemistry researcher will devote much (MUCH) study
  to this group.</p>
  
<p>I hope that this has been helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Forest Gump:</strong></p>
  
<p><strong>CB:</strong> (2) Another dodgy thing about <em>Fester's</em> "<strong>Practical LSD Manufacture</strong>" is his
  recommendation to make LSAs by growing ergot on rye and to plant your own rye
  field in order to do this! Is the man mad? Fester appears to be ignorant of the
  existence of <em>C. paspali</em>.</p>
  
<p><strong>FG:</strong> Yes, Fester is a bit loopy to think that prospective LSD chemists are going
  to become Farmer for a Year. Although the method certaintly works, the labor and
  amount of solvents required make it impractical for one or two people.</p>
  
<strong><p>Some more references:</p></strong>

  I'm sure <em>M. V. Smith's</em> method in said book will work just fine for <strong>growing</strong> <em>Claviceps</em> species, but it will all be for nought, as no lysergamides' will
  be produced by it.</p>

<h3>Synthesis of LSD-25</h3>
<p>Originally published in 1967 as "<strong>The Psychedelic Guide to Preparation Eucharist</strong>" by <em>Robert E. Brown.</em></p>

<h4>Preparatory arrangements</h4>

<p>Starting material may be any lysergic acid derivative,from Claviceps purpures(ergot) on rye grain or from culture, from 
Ipomea (morning glory) seeds, or from synthetic sources. Preparation <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist1">#1</a> uses any amide, or lysergic acid as 
starting material. Preparations <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist2">#2</a> and <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist3">#3</a> must start with lysergic acid only, prepared from the amides as follows:</p>

<p>10 g of any lysergic acid amide from various natural sources is dissolved in 200ml of mathanoic KOH solution and the 
methanol removed immediately in vacuum. The residue is treated with 200ml of an 8% aqueous solution of KOH and the mixture 
heated on a steam bath for one hour. A stream of N<sub>2</sub> gas is passed through the flask during heating and the evolved NH<sub>3</sub> in 
the gas stream may be titrated in HCL to follow the reaction. The alkaline solution is made neutral to congo red with tartaric 
acid,filtered,cleaned by extracting with ether, the aqueous solution filtered and evaporated. Digest with MeOH to remove 
some of the colored material from the crystals of lysergic acid.</p>

<p>Arrange the lighting in the laboratory similarly to that of a darkroom. Use photographic red and yellow safety lights since 
lysergic acid derivatives are decomposed by light. A weak, long wave ultraviolet source is conveniently made from the purple 
glass filter used in the 1950 ford dash lighting system. A small tungsten bulb will provide enough light.</p>

<p>Have plenty of aluminum foil handy to cover reagents and products when light is present. Rubber gloves must be worn due 
to the highly poisonous nature of ergot alkaloids. A hair dryer, or, much better, a flash evaporator, is necessary to speed up 
steps where evaporation is necessary.</p>

<a name="eucharist1"></a>
<h4>Preparation #1</h4>

<p><strong>Step I - Use Yellow Light</strong></p>

<p>Place one volume of powdered ergot alkaloid material in a tiny roundbottom flask and add two volumes of anhydrous 
hydrazine. An alternate procedure uses a sealed tube in which the reagents are heated at 112�C. The mixture is 
refluxed (or heated) for 30 minutes. With an open condenser, keep an inert atmosphere on the reaction. Add 1.5 volumes H<sub>2</sub>O 
and boil 15 minutes. On cooling in the refrigerator, isolysergic acid hydrazide is crystallized.</p>

<p><strong>Step II - Use Red Light</strong></p>

<p>Chill all reagents and have ice handy. Dissolve 2.82 g of the hydrazide rapidly in 100ml 0.1 N ice-cold HCl using an ice 
bath to keep the reaction vessel at 0&deg;C. 100ml ice-cold 0.1 N NaNO<sub>2</sub> is added and after 2 to 3 minutes vigorous stirring, 
130ml more HCl is added dropwise with vigorous stirring again in an ice bath. After 5 minutes, neutralize the solution with 
NaHCO<sub>3</sub> saturated sol. and extract with ether. Remove the aqueous solution and try to dissolve the gummy substance in ether. 
Adjust the ether solution by adding 3 g diethylamine per 39ml ether extract. Allow to stand in dark, gradually warming up to 
20&deg;C over a period of 24 hours. Evaporate in vacuum and treat as indicated in the purification section for conversion of 
iso-lysergic amides to lysergic acid amides.</p>

<a name="eucharist2"></a>
<h4>Preparation # 2</h4>

<a name="eucharist2-1"></a>
<p><strong>Step I - Use Yellow Light</strong></p>

<p>5.36 g of <em>d</em>-lysergic acid are suspended in 125ml of actonitrile and the suspension cooled to about -20�C
in a bath of acetone cooled with dry ice. To the suspension is added a cold -20�C solution of 8.82 g of trifluoroacetic 
anhydride in 75ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is allowed to stand at -20�C for about 1.5 hours during which time 
the suspended material dissolves, and the <em>d</em>-lysergic acid is converted to the mixture anhydride of lysergic and 
trifluoroacetic acids. The mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an oil by evaporating the solvent in vacuum at a 
temperature below about 0�C. Everything must be kept anhydrous.</p>

<p><strong>Step II - Use Red Light</strong></p>

<p>The solution of mixed anhydrides in acetonitrile from <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#">Step I</a>  is added to 150ml of acetonitrile containing 7.6 g of 
diethylamine. The mixture is held in the dark at room temperature for about 2 hours. The acetonitrile is evaporated in 
vacuum, leaving a residue of LSD-25 plus other impurities. The residue is dissolved in 150ml of chloroform and 20ml of ice 
water. The chloroform layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted with several portions of chloroform. The chloroform 
portions are combined and in turn,washed with four 50ml portions of ice-water. The chloroform solution is then dried over 
anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated in vacuum.</p>

<a name="eucharist3"></a>
<h4>Preparation # 3</h4>

<p>The following procedure gives good yield and is very fast with little <em>iso</em>-lysergic acid being produced, however, the stoichometry must be exact or yields will drop.</p>

<p><strong>Step I - Use White Light</strong></p>

<p>Sulfur trioxide is produced in an anhydrous state by carefully decomposing anhydrous ferric sulfate at approximately 480�C. Store under anhydrous conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Step II - Use White Light</strong></p>

<p>A carefully dried 22 liter RB flask fitted with an ice bath, condenser, dropping funnel and mechanical stirrer is 
charged with 10 to 11 liters of dimethyformamide (freshly distilled under reduced pressure). The condenser and dropping 
funnel are both protected against atmospheric moisture. 2 lb. of sulfur trioxide (<em>Sulfan B</em>) are introduced dropwise, very 
cautiously with stirring, during 4 to 5 hours. The temperature is kept at 0-5 degrees throughout the addition. After the 
addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1-2 hours until some separated,crystalline sulfur trioxide-dimethylformamide 
complex has dissolved. The reagent is transferred to an air-tight automatic pipette for convenient dispensing, and kept 
in the cold. Although the reagent, which is colorless may change to yellow and red, its efficiency remains unimpaired for three 
to four months in cold storage. An aliguot is dissolved in water and titrated with standard NaOH to a phenolphthalein end point.</p>

<p><strong>Step III - Use Red Light</strong></p>

<p>A solution of 7.15 g of <em>d</em>-lysergic acid monohydrate (25 mmol) and 1.06 g of lithium hydroxide hydrate (25 mmol) in 200 L 
of MeOH is prepared. The solution is distilled on the steam bath under reduced pressure. The residue of glass-like lithium 
lysergate is dissolved in 400ml of anhydrous dimethyl formamide. From this solution about 200ml of the dimethyl formamide is 
distilled off at 15mm pressure through a 12- inch helices packed column. The resulting anhydrous solution of lithium lysergate 
left behind is cooled to 0 degrees and, with stirring, treated rapidly with 500ml of SO<sub>3</sub>-DMF solution (1.00 M soln). The mixture 
is stirred in the cold for 10 minutes and then 9.14 g (125.0 mmol) of diethylamine is added. The stirring and cooling are 
continued for 10 minutes longer, when 400ml of water is added to decompose the reaction complex. After mixing thoroughly, 200ml 
of saturated aqueous NaCl solution is added. The amide product is isolated by repeated extraction with 500ml portions of 
ethylene dicloride. The combined extract is dried and then concentrated to a syrup under reduced pressure. Do not heat the 
syrup during concentration. The LSD may crystallize out, but the crystals and the mother liquor may be chromatographed according 
to the instructions on purification.</p>

<h4>Purification of LSD-25</h4>

<p>The material obtained by any of these three preparations may contain both lysergic acid and iso-lysergic acid amides. 
  <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist1">Preparation #1</a> contains mostly <em>iso</em>-lysergic diethylamide and must be converted prior to separation. For this material, go to <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#salvage2">Step II</a> first.</p>

<p><strong>Step I - Use Darkroom and follow with Long Wave UV</strong></p>

<p>The material is dissolved in a three to one mixture of benzene in chloroform. Pack a chromatography column with a 
slurry of basic alumina in benzene so that a one-inch column is six inches long. Drain the solvent to the top of the alumina 
column and carefully add an aliquot of the LSD-solvent solution containing 50ml of solvent and 1 g LSD. Run this solution 
through the column, following the fastest moving blue fluorescent band. After it has been collected, strip the 
remaining material from the column by washing with MeOH. Use the UV light sparingly during this procedure to prevent excessive 
damage to the compounds. Evaporate the second fraction in vacuum and set aside for <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#salvage2">Step II</a>. The fraction containing the pure LSD 
is concentrated in vacuum and the syrup will crystallize slowly. This material may be converted to the tartaric acid and the LSD 
tartrate conveniently crystallized, mp 190-196�C</p>

<a name="salvage2"></a>
<p><strong>Step II - Use Red Light</strong></p>

<p>Dissolve the residue derived from the methanol stripping of the column in a minimum amount of alcohol. Add twice that volume 
of 4 N alcoholic KOH solution and allow the mixture to stand at room temperature for several hours. Neutralize with dilute HCl, 
make slightly basic with NH<sub>4</sub>OH and extract with chloroform or ethylene dicloride as in preparations <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist1">#1</a> 
or <a href="lsd.synthesis.html#eucharist2">#2</a>. Evaporate in vacuum and chromatograph as in the previous step.</p>

<p><strong>Salvage</strong></p>

<p>Neutralize all leftover solutions and residues with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and evaporate in vacuum to low volume. Extract with ammoniacal 
chloroform and evaporate the extract to dryness. This residue may be run through the whole process again and more LSD will be produced.</p>

<h4>Storage and use</h4>

<p>Lysergic acid compounds (among them LSD) are unstable to heat, light and oxygen. In any form it helps to add ascorbic 
acid as an anti-oxidant, keeping the container tightly closed, light-tight with aluminum foil, and in refrigerator.</p>

<p>Packaging for use presents many possibilities, partially due to the incredibly small dosage involved. First a bio-assay 
of the solvent is made, then it may be measured by the volume of the solvent it is in. The solvent may be evaporated onto a 
weighed, calculated amount of some inactive powder such as chalk. sugar or baking soda. This bulky powder may be easily 
encapsulated in weightable portions. It is advantageous to add a trace of dry ascorbic acid to the dried powders. Sugar cubes 
offer a handy but extremely notorious method of dispensing. Other methods are without number, here being offered just a few 
occasionally used by the criminal element. Gelatin capsules are coated with the liquid solution and the capsules filled with an 
inert substance. Decoys such as this inert mixture might include a trace of brown color, a trace of quinine for fluorescence, and 
a trace of some relatively non-toxic compound which nearly mimicas the infra-red spectrum of LSD. For transport, a smuggler 
might evaporate a considerable amount onto a pocket handkerchief or onto a sheet of paper, providing the solution was properly 
decolorized before such treatment. These underhanded methods are used by criminals to avoid punitive action by law enforcement enthusiasts.</p>

<p>One gram of pure LSD, if used in a truly enlightened, careful manner can be the door to a magnificent experience to nearly 3,000 individuals. 
Used furtively and in ignorance, the same amount may bring terrible confusion and abject terror to nearly one-third of these.</p>

<p>As a public service to <a href="news://alt.drugs">alt.drugs</a> I have posted the following with some comments by myself. The following is a good example of the credo: 
A handful of refs does not a chemist make. I found this on one of the drug info sites. I've number the lines for commenting.</p>

was dissolved in a minimum amount of MeOH and acidified with a freshly prepared 20% solution of maleic acid in MeOH. Crystallization occured
spontaneously. The needles were filtered, washed with cold MeOH and air-dried. Yield was 66% after further purification by column
chromatography over alumina (Brockman) and elution with 3:1 benzene-chloroform. The chromatography takes appx 8-9
hours. Alternatively, it can be crystallized as the (+)-tartrate from MeOH. After crystallizing from cold MeOH, it is diluted with ethyl
acetate, filtered and the the crystals are washed with ethyl acetate.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure also works for primary amines and small dialkyl amines. LSD, however, probably remains the most worthwhile product. Other
interesting amines might be the N-ethyl-N-propyl derivative (LEP) and the morpholide (LSM-775). 75&micro;g of the morpholide have been reported
to have been as effective as 50&micro;g of <em>d</em>-LSD but with 45 min onset (vs 1 hour) and a 1 hour peak (vs 4 hours). The procedure would probably
work well for LEP, but yields would be reduced for the morpholide. Other N<sup>20</sup>-alkyl-lysergic acid derivatives tend to be more than 10
times less potent than LSD if not effectively inactive. N<sup>6</sup>-ethyl- (and allyl/propyl) derivates of LSD may be more active than
LSD itself, but synthetic routes to these chemicals presently start with LSD and yields would probably inhibit their appearance on the
illicit market. (N<sup>6</sup> is the other nitrogen on the ring structure in addition to the N<sup>1</sup> pyrrole/indole nitrogen). Derivatives
of LSD (besides LSA/LA-111 and lysergic acid) are not scheduled, but would be prosecutable under the designer drugs act after testimony
from a DEA agent that <em>in their opinion</em> the defendant was planning to distribute them.</p>

<p><strong>Line 2:</strong> The 3.25g of <em>d</em>-lysergic acid monohydrate is suppose to be
dissolved in 150ml of CHCl<sub>3</sub>. 96mmol of diethylamine is supposed to be
used and 96mmol of this is ~7.1g, not 4.45g...(where's a good periodic
chart when you need one?). The 7.1g of diethylamine is supposed to be
dissolved in 25ml of CHCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>Line 3-4:</strong> To the 3.25g of <em>d</em>-lysergic acid monohydrate dissolved in
150ml of CHCl<sub>3</sub> that is undergoing reflux is added the
diethylamine/CHCl<sub>3</sub> solution and 2 ml of POCl<sub>3</sub>. These
are added simultaneously from separate dropping funnels over 2-3
minutes. Method B</p>

<p><strong>Line 8:</strong> The CHCl<sub>3</sub> is dried... What? Yes, it's dried but this is the first time that the 
procedure that was given in this "how to" even makes mention of it! Of course, all of this is made very clear in the ref: 
<strong>[</strong><em>Johnson, Ary, Teiger, Kassel.</em> "<strong>Emetic Activity of Reduced Lysergamides.</strong>" 
<a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/lysergamide.emetics.pdf">Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 16(5), 532-537 (1973)</a><strong>]</strong></p>

<p>It's pretty clear that this "how to" was posted by someone with little or no chemical expertise who had a couple of refs in hand, ran to the
local college library, photocopied the papers, typed up this mess and posted it for the benefit (ha!) of others.</p>

<p>So, do you still want to attempt a synthesis of LSD? Yes? Well get the refs and get the whole story. A few chemistry classes wouldn't hurt either.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: How to Make LSD File 2
<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Mon, 4 Apr 1994</p>

<p>When I saw the subjects relating to the synthesis of LSD, I knew the information would be outdated. It's humourous to see people who think 
they're in the know giving out info that was outdated even in the 70's.</p>

<p>Lysergic acid amides are commonly made by a simple and efficient procedure using POCl<sub>3</sub> and the desired amine in CHCl<sub>3</sub> solution. I doubt that this
procedure is used by the majority of clandestine chemists, but since I don't know any, I wouldn't know. By the description of the procedure,
it's simple and uses relatively safe reagents (I have a reference, but not handy...) And you won't find it in any obvious places even in the 
most recent Merck because LSD is not the product of focus in the article.</p>

<p>This is why I doubt that unsavvy clandestine chemists would be using this procedure. But according to the article, the method has a broad scope
and has been used by Nichols and Oberlender for some other lysergic acid amides. (The article in question regards 9,10-saturated derivatives 
tested for emetic properties). It's time to stop turning to those stupid "how to make your very own drug" guides and learn how to read real chemsitry
literature. If you can't, don't bother... </p>

<p>Even the synthesis of lysergic acid is outdated. Rebek has described an extremely elegant synthesis of methyl lysergate from L-tryptophan 
which gives only the natural isomer of lysergic acid. It's still a several step procedure, but most of the reagents are fairly common and the
yields are greatly improved over past syntheses.</p>

<p>This brings me to an interesting side-note. Several years ago, analogues of LSD that were 2 and 3 times as potent as LSD were synthesized. These
went largely unnoticed and would most likely prove of little interest  to clandestine chemists because LSD was the precursor used and the loss
in synthesis outweighed the gain in potency. But using Rebek's synthesis, one could simply alter the procedure slightly and intorduce the groups
that make the compounds more potent. When the 6N-methyl group is replaced by ethyl or allyl, it becomes 2 and 3 times as potent respectively.</p>

<p>I am posting this for general information. I may post references if I decide it would be prudent. Requests will be ignored and I ask you not to
send e-mail requesting references. But if you just want to chat about them and maybe speculate on subjective effects or other avenues of substitution...
I don't know if I'll ever see the day that research in this area is open and legal, but I'd love to...</p>
