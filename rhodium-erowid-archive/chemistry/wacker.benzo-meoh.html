<br><h3>Materials</h3>

<ul>
	<li><span class="oli">400mL MeOH (methanol)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">50mL distilled H<sub>2</sub>O</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">150g p-Benzoquinone </span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">2g palladium (II) chloride (PdCl<sub>2</sub>)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">178g safrole</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">DCM (methylene chloride; dichloromethane)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">NaCl (non-iodized table salt)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">5% NaOH </span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">HCl (hydrochloric acid, from muriatic acid)</span></li>
	<li><span class="oli">Magnesium sulfate drying agent (epsom salts baked in 400�F oven for 2 hours)</span></li>
</ul>

<br><h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
	<li><span class="oli">In a 2L flask fitted with a reflux condenser and addition funnel place 400ml 
MeOH, 50ml <em>d</em>H<sub>2</sub>O, 150g p-Benzoquinone and 2g PdCl<sub>2</sub> and leave to stir for a 
minimum of 60 minutes. Note that a recent improvement has been discussed which 
involves stirring the PdCl<sub>2</sub> in the solvent (MeOH in this case) for several hours 
before adding the water and benzoquinone. It is likely that this does enhance 
yields a bit by ensuring maximum efficiency of the PdCl<sub>2</sub>�s catalytic action. 
Either way will work well, however. If you let the PdCl<sub>2</sub> stir alone for a while, 
when you then add the water and benzoquinone, let them stir for an hour as well 
before beginning the next step so as to ensure complete dissolution of the 
benzoquinone.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Place 178g safrole mixed with a bit of MeOH in an addition funnel.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Add safrole dropwise from the addition funnel over 60 minutes or more. 
However, when the addition is about 80% finished, apply low heat just sufficient 
to start a mild reflux (cold water through the condenser).</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">After the safrole addition is complete, leave mixture stirring and refluxing 
for 8 hours. (If you must stop at this point and resume another day, be sure to 
put the mixture in the freezer, sealed well. The raw ketone decomposes unless 
stored at freezer temperatures.)</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Filter out the solids present in the mixture, which are hydroquinone (the 
degradation product of the benzoquinone) and PdCl<sub>2</sub>. This can be done by vacuum 
filtration or by simple gravity filtration with coffee filters. Many prefer 
gravity filtration with this synthesis because the solids produced in this 
reaction are very fine and are problematic to filter with vacuum. Don�t try to 
recycle the PdCl<sub>2</sub>, as it is too difficult to separate from the hydroquinone to 
be worthwhile.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Flood mixture with 1.7L 3N (~10%) HCl. (Here's the quick math: add 500mL of 
31% HCl [muriatic acid] to 1150mL H<sub>2</sub>O to get 1.65L ~10% HCl�close enough for 
this purpose.)</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Extract flooded mixture with 3 portions of DCM (1 x 500mL, 1 x 250mL, 1 x 
100mL) in a large separatory funnel. The desired raw product, MDP-2-P 
(�ketone�), migrates into the DCM as an oil. Separate the DCM/ketone layers and 
combine them. (Note: when you first hit it with the DCM you will probably 
observe a bit of scum which will float on top of the water layer, which will 
work its way down during these three extractions to appear as a blob of spongy 
semi-solid interface. It�s actually very mobile and easy to work around; simply 
avoid allowing it into your DCM separations. The same thing will happen in your 
washes in <strong>Steps</strong> <strong>10</strong>, <strong>11</strong> and <strong>12</strong> below, but by then you will be quite the pro at 
working with it.)</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Extract water layer with a final small amount of DCM.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Add this final small DCM extraction to the combined oil/DCM solution from <strong>Step</strong> <strong>8</strong>.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Wash the ketone/DCM solution with saturated sodium bicarbonate in water 
twice (500mL each wash).</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Wash the ketone/DCM solution with saturated NaCl 3 times (400-500mL each 
wash). (Note: as you do these bicarb and salt water washes, you should be seeing 
the ketone/DCM solution getting progressively more greenish colored; this is 
visible in the film of solution that runs down the inner surface of the sep 
funnel).</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Wash the ketone/DCM solution 3 times with 500mL 5% NaOH (500mL each wash). 
If you did <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5</strong>, you will have a very easy separation. (Note: you should also 
see a very noticeable color change upon doing the first of these three washes 
wherein the ketone/DCM layer becomes a strange, thick reddish-brown with green 
overtones. This happens as the NaOH pulls the majority of the solvated 
hydroquinone into its layer, cleaning the ketone. The NaOH layer in the first 
wash will be very dark brown, almost black in fact. The next two will be a far 
lighter, watery, orangy color.)</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Dry the ketone/DCM solution with ~50g magnesium sulfate.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Distill off the DCM using mild heat on a water bath and ice-cold water 
through the condenser. This will take several hours.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Add 50mL of high-oleic safflower oil (no additives!!) to the ketone oil as a 
buffer to prevent the ketone from scorching in the distilling flask. <span class="redtxt">[<strong>Note by Rhodium:</strong> Use of so-called "Buffer Oil" serves no practical purpose, and its use originates in chem lab superstition and misunderstandings. At best it does nothing, but impurities in the oil may react with your product and lower your yield]</span>.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">Vacuum distill the ketone/buffer oil mixture. This also will take several 
hours (around 8 hours at this scale, in my experience).</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">At 100 to 140�C (wherever your particular vacuum dictates), a minor amount 
of safrole should come over. If your safrole-to-ketone conversion was good, 
there should only be a very small amount. If it is only a few drops to a 
milliliter or two, you can leave it in, and not change/clean receiving flasks. 
If you are a stickler for purity, discard it. It will not harm anything later if 
you leave it in. But if it�s more than a couple of milliliters, get rid of it.</span></li>

	<li><span class="oli">At anywhere from 25 to 40�C above the temperature your safrole usually comes 
over with the same vacuum, the ketone should begin coming over. You should get 
about 100 to 120g ketone. The color of the ketone coming over should be a pale, 
fluorescent-looking greenish yellow. In fact it looks not unlike anti-freeze�a 
similar �neon green.� You can stop distilling when the rate of ketone coming 
over has slowed to an agonizing one drop per 90 seconds or so. At this point 
there is so little left that it is probably not worth your time to wait for a 
drop per 1.5 minutes (it�s not worth mine anyway).</span></li> 

	<li><span class="oli">Immediately store your precious fluid in the freezer in a sealed flask or bottle. Happy cooking!</span></li>
