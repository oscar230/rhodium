<h2>MDP2P from Safrole<br>Using a Novel Epoxidation Phase Transfer Catalyst</h2>
<h4>by Rhodium</h4>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt">

<p>Safrole can be directly oxidized to a terminal epoxide with aqueous hydrogen peroxide in a two-phase system,
using a special PTC cabable of carrying peroxide equivalents into the organic phase, consisting of a methyltrioctylammonium quaternary anion derived from Aliquat 336 and a  phosphoperoxotungstate cation, the latter of which is an complex between phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and four units of tungstic acid which has been oxidized with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p>The formed safrole epoxide is then isomerized to MDP2P by heating it with lithium iodide, a very mild Lewis acid.</p>

</div>

<p>A suspension of tungstic acid (2.50g, 10 mmol) in 7 ml of 30% aqueous  H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was stirred and heated to 60�C until a colorless solution was  obtained.
To this solution, filtered and cooled to room temperature, was  added 40% w/v H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (0.62ml, ca 2.5 mmol), and the whole was diluted to  30 ml with water.
To the resultant soluton, 2.09g of methyltrioctylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336, 97% pure, equivalent to 2.027g, 5 mmol) in DCM (40 ml) was added dropwise with stirring
over about 2 min. Stirring was  continued for an additional 15 min. The organic phase was then separated,  dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and gently
evaporated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 40-50�C (bath temp) to give 3.70 g (98.4%, based on the quaternary ammonium salt charged) of an
almost colorless syrup.</p>

<p><strong>Oxidation of safrole to MDP2P<a href="peroxotungstate.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a></strong></p>

<p>In a 100ml three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer and a reflux condenser, a vigorously stirred mixture of
the above catalyst (0.7g, 0.31 mmol), safrole (13.24g, 80mmol),  benzene (35 ml) and 40% w/v H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5.10ml, 60 mmol) was heated to 60�C and  kept at this
temperature for 60 min (External cooling is needed!). The mixture was cooled to room temp, the organic phase was separated and  diluted with 30 ml Et<sub>2</sub>O.
In order to remove the catalyst, the organic  solution was first stirred with a solution of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (0.75g) and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>  (0.75g) in water (10 ml) for a
few minutes, then separated, dried over  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and passed through a short column (2.5 cm diam) of silica gel (50g), and ~300ml anhydrous Et<sub>2</sub>O was
passed through the column to ensure complete elution of the products. The solvent was evaporated and the  residue dissolved in 18 ml of tetraglyme and
treated with anhydrous LiI (0.130g, 0.97 mmol) at 130�C for 5h. After cooling, the products were distilled under vacuum, recovering 5.17 grams safrole
(saved for the next run) and collecting 6.25 grams of MDP2P.</p>
