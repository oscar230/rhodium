<p>An accurate concentration of alkyllithium reagents is essential for performing 
  air and moisture sensitive chemistry. Thus, it is essential that periodic assays 
  of the alkyllithium reagents be performed to ensure quality results in reactions 
  which require the use of such chemicals. The following procedures are for the 
  titrations of these organometallics. These titrations are usually performed 
  three times and an average of the concentrations is taken to be certain that 
  an accurate titer is obtained.</p>

<h2>Procedure 1</h2>
<h5>Titrations of organometallics using diphenylacetic acid</h5>
 
<div class="exp"> 
<p>An oven-dried 25 mL three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a nitrogen 
  inlet, a stirring bar and two rubber septa is cooled under a stream of nitrogen. 
  The flask is then charged with <em>ca.</em> 300 mg (<b><em>but accurately weighed 
  out!*</em></b>) of diphenylacetic acid and 10 mL of dry THF. To the resulting 
  solution is added the organometallic reagent (alkyl lithiums) via a 1.0 mL syringe 
  (graduated in 0.01 mL increments) in a dropwise fashion. During addition, it 
  will be observed that periodic quantities of a yellow colored substance will 
  appear in solution. This is the enolate dianion of diphenyl acetic acid, and 
  it will be noted that in the early stages of this titration, this yellow color 
  will disperse rapidly. As one nears the endpoint, the yellow coloration will 
  require longer periods of time to disperse. At this point, it is necessary to 
  slow the rate of addition of the alkyl lithium reagent as the endpoint is approaching. 
  Eventually, the addition of a single drop of alkyl lithium will cause a persistent 
  yellow coloration of the solution. This is the endpoint of the titration. Take 
  note of the final volume of the syringe. The difference between the original 
  volume of organometallic solution and this final volume of solution represents 
  the volume of the titrant. Repeat this titration two additional times using 
  a fresh flask, solvent and diphenyl acetic acid. The average of these three 
  runs constitutes the molarity of the alkyl lithium solution.</p>
</div>

<p>Shown below is the chemical reaction which is occurring during the titration, 
  as well as a sample calculation for determining the molarity of the alkyl lithium 
  solution. In this example, 300mg of diphenylacetic acid was used, which required 
  0.84mL of the RLi solution to reach endpoint.</p>

  <p><b>0.300g acid</b> = <b>1.40mmol acid</b>, which reacts with <b>1.40mmol 
    RLi</b>; <br>
    this amount of RLi was present in <b>0.84mL</b> of the analyte. <br>
    Since molarity equals moles/L, it also equals mmol/mL. Thus:</p>
	 
  <p><b>1.40 mmol RLi / 0.84mL solution = 1.67M RLi soln.</b></p>
   
  <p>* In other words, you should use <em>about</em> 300mg of diphenylacetic acid, 
    but it doesn't have to be <br>
    exactly <strong>300</strong>mg. However, you must know, precisely, the amount 
    that you <em>do</em> use, since it is <br>
    from this value that the alkyl lithium molarity is being calculated!</p>

<h2>Procedure 2</h2>
<h5>Titration of alkyl lithium solutions using a charge transfer complex indicator</h5>
   
<p>This procedure is slightly superior to the above method due to the fact that 
  the endpoint is colored bright red, which makes distinguishing the endpoint 
  much easier. This procedure is almost identical to the one mentioned above.</p>

<div class="exp">   
<p>An oven dried 25 mL three neck flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, 
  a stirring bar and two rubber septa was cooled under a stream of nitrogen. Upon 
  cooling the flask was charged with <em>ca.</em> 200 mg of menthol (<b><em>but accurately 
  weighed out!</em></b>), <em>ca.</em> 5 mg of 2,2'-dipyridyl and 10 mL of dry THF. 
  To the resulting solution is added the organometallic reagent (alkyl lithiums) 
  via a 1.0 mL syringe (graduated in 0.01 mL increments) in a dropwise fashion. 
  During addition, it will be observed that periodic quantities of a red colored 
  substance will appear in solution. This is the charge transfer complex between 
  the alkyl lithium and 2,2'-dipyridyl, and it will be noted that in the early 
  stages of this titration this red color will disperse rapidly. As one nears 
  the endpoint, the red coloration will require longer periods of time to disperse. 
  At this point, it is necessary to slow the rate of addition of the alkyl lithium 
  reagent as the endpoint is approaching. Eventually, the addition of a single 
  drop of alkyl lithium will cause a persistent red coloration of the solution. 
  This is the endpoint of the titration. Take note of the final volume of the 
  syringe. The difference between the original volume of organometallic solution 
  and this final volume of solution represents the volume of the titrant. Repeat 
  this titration two additional times using a fresh flask, solvent, 2,2'-pyridyl, 
  and menthol. The average of these three runs constitutes the molarity of the 
  alkyl lithium solution.</p>

<p>Shown below is the chemical reaction which is occurring during the titration, 
  as well as a sample calculation for determining the molarity of the alkyl lithium 
  solution. Note that the calculation is virtually identical to that done in Procedure 
  1. In this example, 200mg of menthol was used, which required 0.73mL of the 
  RLi solution to reach endpoint.</p>
   
  <p><b>0.200g menthol</b> = <b>1.30mmol menthol</b>, which reacts with <b>1.30mmol 
    RLi</b>;<br>
    this amount of RLi was present in <b>0.73mL</b> of the analyte. <br>
    Since molarity equals moles/L, it also equals mmol/mL. Thus:</p>
	 
  <p><b>1.30 mmol RLi / 0.73mL solution = 1.78M RLi soln.</b></p>

<h2>Procedure 3</h2>
<h5>Titration of potassium <em>tert</em>-butoxide solutions using an acid/base indicator</h5>
   
<p>The following procedure may be used to titrate either LDA solutions or potassium 
  <em>tert</em>-butoxide solutions in THF. The procedure is very similar to those 
  listed above with one notable exception: <b>the indicator used here is fluorene, 
  which is sufficiently acidic that it can be deprotonated by weak bases such 
  as metal alkoxides.</b></p>
   
<div class="exp">
<p>An oven-dried 25 mL three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, 
  a stirring bar and two rubber septa was cooled under a stream of nitrogen. Upon 
  cooling the flask was charged with <em>ca.</em> 200 mg of menthol (<b><em>but accurately 
  weighed out!</em></b>), <em>ca.</em> 5 mg of fluorene and 10 mL of dry THF. To 
  the resulting solution is added the potassium <em>tert</em>-butoxide solution 
  via a 1.0 mL syringe (graduated in 0.01 mL increments) in a dropwise fashion. 
  During addition, it will be observed that periodic quantities of a yellow colored 
  substance will appear in solution. This is the deprotonated form of fluorene, 
  and it will be noted that in the early stages of this titration this yellow 
  color will disperse rapidly. As one nears the endpoint, the yellow coloration 
  will require longer periods of time to disperse. At this point, it is necessary 
  to slow the rate of addition of the alkoxide solution as the endpoint is approaching. 
  Eventually, the addition of a single drop of alkoxide will cause a persistent 
  yellow coloration of the solution. This is the endpoint of the titration. Take 
  note of the final volume of the syringe. The difference between the original 
  volume of alkoxide solution and this final volume of solution represents the 
  volume of the titrant. Repeat this titration two additional times using a fresh 
  flask, solvent, fluorene, and menthol. The average of these three runs constitutes 
  the molarity of the potassium <em>tert</em>-butoxide solution. The calculation 
  is identical to that shown for Procedure 2.</p>
