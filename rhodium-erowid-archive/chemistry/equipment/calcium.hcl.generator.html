<p>Hydrogen chloride is an important chemical of interest not only by itself but also for preparative 
purposes. Although available in cylinders of variable capacity and purity, generation of HCl gas is 
done frequently in chemistry labs.</p>

<p>Hydrogen chloride can bo prepared by a number of methods including<a href="calcium.hcl.generator.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="oli">Dehydrochlorination processes</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Reaction of chlorine with hydrogen and hydrogenated compounds</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis of some chlorides</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Protonation of the chloride ion by strong acids and</span></li>
<li><span class="oli">Liberation from aqueous solutions</span></li>
</ul>

<p>However, most procedures found in preparative handbooks make use of concentrated 
  H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><a href="calcium.hcl.generator.html#refs"><sup>2,3</sup></a>, for example:</p>

  <p><strong>Eq. 1:</strong> 
  <br>NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + HCl<sub>(g)</sub></p>
  <p><strong>Eq. 2:</strong> 
  <br>HCl&middot;(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&middot;(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub> + HCl<sub>(g)</sub></p>

<p>These procedures are the most universally adopted because they work satisfactorily with quite inexpensive chemicals.</p>

  <p><strong>Eq. 1</strong> can be explained in terms of a proton transfer from 
    the strong (in the first ionization) non-volatile sulfuric acid to the weakly 
    basic chloride ion. It works at ambient conditions because HCl is a gas. The 
    combination of acidity, redox properties, low volatility, and cost of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 
    makes it the acid of choice. The process is conducted conveniently in standard 
    glassware assemblies such as those in the figure. Concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
    is poured through the funnel, and salt is placed in the flask. Even though 
    the generator is properly installed, losses of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
    through the stopcock may be produced eventually.</p>
  <p>In <strong>Eq. 2</strong> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> behaves as a water-scavenging 
    agent leading to a system unable to dissolve efficiently the HCl, so it escapes. 
    The well-known dehydrating ability of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, together 
    with the characteristics mentioned above, invite its use for this purpose.</p>

<p>However, because dehydration of hydrochloric acid can be achieved by reagents other than H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and because the handling of 98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, in the freshman lab should be
reduced as much as possible, especially when a significant amount of acid is involved, I want to recommend CaCl<sub>2</sub> for the following reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="oli">CaCl<sub>2</sub> is considerably safer to handle than 
      concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">It also is available at low cost, sometimes as a byproduct 
      of the Solvay process.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">The standard assemblies for gas generation shown above 
      are appropriate for the preparation of crude HCl<sub>(g)</sub>.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">It is able to fix enough water (over the 30% of its 
      weight considering it hydrates only to CaCl<sub>2</sub>&middot;2H<sub>2</sub>O, 
      which is stable up to 150�C) to deliver a significant amount of HCl gas. 
      In a typical run, 100 g of 35% HCl were added over 100 g of granular CaCl<sub>2</sub> 
      at room temperature (the thermal effect is not significant), and 15 g of 
      HCl<sub>(g)</sub> were obtained. This represents over 40% yield, which may 
      be compared with the 80%, yield reported<a href="calcium.hcl.generator.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 
      for the process represented in <strong>Eq. 2</strong>; however, it uses 
      approximately a 1:3 weight ratio between H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 
      HCl<sub>(aq)</sub>.</span></li>
    <li><span class="oli">CaCl<sub>2</sub> also is easier to dispose of than H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 
      and less base is required to neutralize the final waste.</span></li>
  </ul>

<p>An additional advantage of this procedure with respect to those based on H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
  concerns educational aspects. By heating at 200�C, the resulting waxy mixture 
  (or crystalline mass to which it converts after a few hours), the anhydrous 
  CaCl<sub>2</sub>, can be regenerated for re-use once a solution of HCl is obtained. In 
  this case, some calcium oxychloride formed can be ignored.</p>

  <p>Even though this may be without value from a practical viewpoint, it may 
    be of educational significance because it attracts attention to topics of 
    current interest such as optimizing of processes, recycling of chemicals, 
    and reducing of wastes. To this end, the assembly shown in <strong>Fig. 1b</strong> 
    is more appropriate than that in <strong>Fig. 1a</strong> because the resulting 
    mixture is ready to be distilled.</p>
