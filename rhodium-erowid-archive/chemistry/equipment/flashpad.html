<h2>Dry-column Flash Chromatography</h2>
<h4>from "Advanced Practical Organic Chemistry" by Leonard, Lygo &amp; Procter</h4>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt"> 



<p>This technique was developed by L. M. Harwood (<em>Aldrichimica Acta, 1985, 18, 25</em>), and can be used as an alternative to flash chromatography. The apparatus simply consists of a parallel-sided vacuum filter funnel. incorporating a porosity 3 sinter and a flask.</p>	

<h4><h3>Method for running a dry flash column</h3></h4>

<h5>1. Column packing</h5>

<p>Fill the funnel to the lip with TLC grade silica (e.g. Merck Kieselgel 60) and tap gently. then apply suction from a water aspirator. pressing the silica down starting at the circumference and working towards the centre. Continue until a level and firm bed is obtained and there is a head space for sample and solvent addition. The approximate funnel sizes. compared with the quantity of sample to be applied, are given in the table below.</p>

  <TABLE border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <td><strong>Funnel<br>
        Diameter</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Funnel<br>
        Length</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Silica<br>
        Weight</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Sample<br>

      <td><div align="right">15g</div></td>
      <td><div align="right">15-500mg</div></td>

    <tr> 
      <td>40mm</td>
      <td>50mm</td>
      <td><div align="right">30g</div></td>
      <td><div align="right">0.5-2g</div></td>
      <td><div align="right">15-30ml</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>70mm</td>
      <td>55mm</td>
      <td><div align="right">100g</div></td>
      <td><div align="right">1-5 g</div></td>
      <td><div align="right">20-50ml</div></td>
    </tr>
  </TABLE>

</div>

<h5>2. Pre-elution</h5>

  <p>Under vacuum, pre-elute the column with a solvent which will give a TLC R<sub>f</sub> 
    of about 0.2 for the least polar constituent of the sample. If the silica 
    has been packed correctly, the solvent should run down the column with a horizontal 
    front, but if it channels, the column should be sucked dry and re-packed. 
    Keep the surface of the silica covered with solvent while pre-eluting until 
    solvent starts collecting. then suck it dry.</p>

  <h5>3. Loading the sample</h5>

<p>Load the sample as a solution. in the same solvent as used for pre-elution. in an even layer onto the surface of the silica. Alternatively. if the sample is insoluble in the pre-elution solvent. it can be pre-adsorbed onto a small quantity of silica which is then spread on the surface of the silica in the funnel.</p>

<h5>4. Eluting the column</h5>

  <p>Sequentially add solvent fractions to the funnel according to the quantities 
    indicated in the table, sucking the silica dry in between each fraction, and 
    keeping fractions separate. For each successive fraction increase the solvent 
    polarity by increasing the proportion of the more polar solvent by about 5-10% 
    (e.g. from 50% EtOAc/50% petrol to 55% EtOAc. for a 10% increase). Analyse 
    the fractions by TLC to determine the locations of the components of interest, 
    but as a rough guide. the solvent mixture which would give the compound a 
    tlc R<sub>f</sub> value of about 0.5 will probably elute it. As with any chromatographic 
    technique expertise will only come with experience. but given that. you should 
    be able to separate quite closely running compounds quickly using this technique.</p>
