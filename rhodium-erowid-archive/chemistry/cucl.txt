                      Preparation of Copper Chlorides
================================================================================

In a 100-mL. round-bottom flask, prepare a solution of 6 g (0.002 mole) of
powdered copper sulfate crystal (5-hydrate) and 1.8 g. of sodium chloride in
20 mL. of hot water. in a beaker prepare a solution of 1.4 g. of sodium bisulfite
and 0.9 g of solid sodium hydroxide in about 1.4 mL. of water, and add this
solution to with swirling to the hot copper sulfate solution over a period of
5-10 min. Cool the mixture to room temperature, allow the cuprous chloride to
settle, and decant off the liquid. Wash the precipitated cuprous chloride 2 or 3
times with water by decantation. The cuprous chloride is obtained as a white
powder that darkens on exposure to air. Dissolve the cuprous chloride solution
by adding 7 mL. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 2.5 mL. of water. Cork the
flask to minimize oxidation and place in an ice bath.

An alternative procedure is to dissolve 2.0 g. of commercial cuprous chloride in
7 mL. of concentrated HCl and 2.5 mL. of water.

I prepared cuprous chloride by mixing copper wire, CuCO3 and a excess of
commercial 20 % HCl and warming it near boiling point until all copper was
dissolved. It was the deposition of a white powder (cuprous chloride). This
product can't be dried because it oxydizes quickly, it was washed with water.
Normal reaction is with copper wire or powder, CuCl2 and HCl, but I had then CuCO3.

Also cupric chloride was prepared by reacting a solution of CuCO3 with an
slightly excess of HCl, then evaporating water and finally, when product starts
to turn brown, air dried to give a hydrate form.

Heres a procedure for producing CuCl and CuCl2 from copper metal, nitric acid
being the only non-OTC ingredient: http://chemistry.rutgers.edu/genchem/CuCl.html

Simplest synth for CuCl2 came from Osmium and is simply adding copper sulfate
solution to calcium chloride soln' while stirring, until no more cloudy ppt.
forms, then evaporating the water and dehydrating the very deliquesent green salt
until it's brownish white.

CuCl2 Synth from CuCO3 & CuO, v1.0 - by Hellman

So your an OTC man/woman who needs some CuCl2, to complete the first part
of your dream, and the last thing you want to do is order from the chem
supply store, as paranoia always rears it's ugly head.

Well here's the answers, if you have not worked it out for your self.

Intro.

This is a relativly easy synth, firstly you need either some CuCO3 or some
CuO, both can usually be found metres from each other in your local POTTERY
supply store. You will find one locally, unless you live in a 3rd world
country, and I Sincerly sympathise with you, although if you are then you
will find your way,.

These store's house an amazement of luxurious inorganic Carbonates and
oxides, ranging from the simplest metallic rusts to mind altering Lithium
Carbonate, Good price 2.5 kg $70.00.

You will enjoy you walk through THESE stores.

Pickup a 100g or smaller of CaCO3 or CaO for around $3.00 US and take it
home, with a small botlle of HCL.

Proceedure,

These methods I describe are actual events based on non uniform measuring
teqniques, showing you that it doesn't really matter that much.

In a ceramic Soup bowl I poured roughly 30g of this lime green CuCO3 into it.

So far so good,

Then I simply just poured regular muriatic acid (30% HCl) into this soup
bowl until all the frothing stops, About 70ml, Could of even been 100ml.

After the yellowy rigourus bubbles died down, and further addition of acid
did nothing,my job was basically done.

Then I placed this bowl on my BBQ on low heat and started my1 hour evap.
fun. Not very fun at all, I have no PATIENCE. Slowly but surely, it did,
and once I got it to the dry sludge stage, I lowered the heat and placed it
in an Unused oven, with the door open.

Actually that's a lie, I left it overnight, which did fuck all, except
reabsorb more moisture,. It's true, this stuff, left in cold conditions,
will go back into solution.

Spiceboy states it goes brown when heated too much, he is right, BUT, it
goes back to its green crystal colour once it's moisture seranades
it.(Absorbs into it again)

Moral of Story,

Heat in oven on low until most of the moisture has gone, then bottle. It is
feasable to roast the whole lot, on a stove top, to you get your brown
anhydrous form, then bottle it with the lid open, until it resumes it
slight lime green crystally appearance.

It looks good, It's easy,It's done, I'm Happy

Copper(I)-bromide (CuBr, mp 492°C, bp 1345°C)

CuBr forms when copper is dissolved in etherical HBr, at first the dietherate
of a bromo acid HCuBr2 is built (yellow oil). when decomposed with water, CuBr
results as a colorless crystalline powder. solubility product of CuBr = 4.2x10^-8

Preparation of Copper(I)Chloride

Copper(I) chloride is also produced hydrometallurgically by the reduction of
copper(II) in the presence of chloride ions [71]

2 CuCl2 + Na2SO3 + H2O ---> 2 CuCl + Na2SO4 + 2 HCl :

Other reducing agents can be used, such as metallic copper, sulfurous acid,
hydroxylamine, hydrazine, or phosphorous acid. The copper(I) chloride solution is
produced, for example, by mixing a copper(II) chloride solution with metallic copper
in the presence of hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride. The colorless to brown
solution is stable only in the absence of air. Continuous preparations of copper(I)
chloride solutions have been developed [72] , [73]. When they are diluted with
water, a white crystalline material precipitates which can be vacuum dried or
washed with sulfurous acid, then with alcohol and ether, and carefully dried. Zinc
has also been used as a reducing agent in a more recent process [74].

Production of copper(I) chloride by treatment of ores with iron(III) chloride
solutions [75] , [76] and recovery of the product through chlorination in pit
furnaces above 800 °C [77] have also been attempted.
