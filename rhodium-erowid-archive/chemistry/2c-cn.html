<h4>2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl-2-(phthalimidoamino)-ethane</h4>

  <p>To a solution of <strong>2C-B</strong> freebase (7.24 g, 27.8 mmol) and phthalic
    anhydride (4.5 g, 30 mmol) in 100 mL of DMF (distilled) was added 4A molecular
    sieves. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux overnight and, after
    cooling, was suction filtered to remove the molecular sieves. Treatment with
    CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> resulted in the formation of yellow needles.
    Recrystallization from EtOH provided 7.57 g (69%) of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl-2- (phthalimidoamino)-ethane,
    mp 141.5-142�C.</p>
  <h4>2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenyl-2-(phthalimidoamino)-ethane</h4>

  <p>The above phtalimide (7.57 g, 19.4 mmol) and cuprous cyanide (2.0 g , 22.3
    mmol) in 150 mL of DMF were heated under reflux for 5 h. The mixture was poured
    into a solution containing hydrated ferric chloride (6 g), 1.48 mL of concentrated
    HCl, and 9 mL of water. The solution was maintained at a temperature of 60-70�C
    for 20 min. to decompose the complex and then extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.
    The orgranic phase was washed with diluted aqeuous HCl (100mL), dried (MgSO4)
    and evaporated to give a white solid. Recrystallization from EtOH provided
    5.96 g (91%) of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenyl-2-(phthalimidoamino)-ethane as
    white needles, mp 194-195�C.</p>

<h4>1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenyl)-2-aminoethane (2C-CN)</h4>

  <p>The above phtalimide (9.2 g, 27.38 mmol) and hydrazine (2.2 mL, 68.55 mmol,
    98%) in 50 mL of anhydrous EtOH were heated under reflux for 15 min. After
    the mixture was cooled, the phthalazinedione was filtered off, and the filtrate
    was evaporated to give a solid residue. The solid was dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O
    and extracted with CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The organic extract was washed with aqeous
    Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (10%, 3x100mL), dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
    and evaporated to give 3.6 g (64%) <strong>2C-CN</strong>. The HCl salt (precipitated
    from ether) was recrystallized from EtOH, mp 220-222�C.</p>
