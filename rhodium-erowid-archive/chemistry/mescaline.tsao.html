        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		
        <p>The cactus alkaloid, mescaline, &beta;-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-ethylamine,
          has been studied for some years, because of its most interesting effects
          on the psychic states of human subjects. Since the elucidation of the
          chemical structure of the alkaloid through the synthesis by Sp&auml;th<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>, a
          few other methods of preparation have been published<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>2-7</sup></a>. A simple synthesis
          utilizing lithium aluminum hydride is presented in this report. </p>
        <p>The
            synthesis may be outlined as follows:</p>
        <p>Gallic acid &rarr; 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic
          acid &rarr; Methyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate &rarr; 
          3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl alcohol &rarr; 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl
          chloride &rarr; 3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile
           &rarr; Mescaline.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
        <p><strong>Methyl Ester of 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzoic Acid</strong></p>
        <p>To a solution prepared from 100 g of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>          (0.47 mole), 20 g. of sodium hydroxide, 55 g. of sodium carbonate and
          300 ml. of water is added, with stirring, 94 ml. of methyl sulfate (0.94
          mole) during the course of 20 minutes. The reaction mixture is refluxed
          for one-half hour. The crude ester (65 g., 61 %) precipitates from the
          cold mixture. From the filtrate 38 g. of starting material is recovered
          upon acidification with diluted hydrochloric acid. The ester is further
          purified by solution in the minimum amount of methanol and treatment
          with norite. Usually it is necessary to repeat this treatment to obtain
          a colorless crystalline product that melts at 80-82°C. Semmler<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>, who employed
          a different Process, reported mp 83-84°C.</p>
        <p><strong>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl Alcohol</strong></p>
        <p>To a suspension of 4.6 g (0.12 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride in
          200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, in the course of 30 minutes, a
          solution of 22.6 g (0.1 mole) of the methyl ester of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic
          acid in 300 ml. of ether. The solid which forms is carefully decomposed
          first with 50 ml. of ice-water. After decantation of the ether, 250
          ml of ice-cold 10% sulfuric acid is added. The product is extracted
          with 150 ml. Of ether. The combined extracts, after drying over sodium
          sulfate, are freed of ether and the residue distilled; bp 135-137&deg;C/0.25mmHg; yield 14.7 g. (73%). This compound was obtained by a different
          method by Marx<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>; b.p. 228°C (25 mm.).</p>
        <p><strong>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl Chloride</strong></p>
        <p>A mixture of 25 g. of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl alcohol and 125 ml. of
          ice-cold concentrated hydrochloric acid is shaken vigorously until a
          homogeneous solution is obtained. In a few minutes a turbidity develops,
          followed by a heavy precipitation of gummy product. After 4 hours and
          dilution with 100 ml. of icewater, the aqueous layer is decanted and
          extracted with three 50-ml. portions of benzene. Then the gummy organic
          residue is dissolved in the combined benzene extracts. The benzene solution
          is washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate.</p>
        <p>The benzene solution is transferred to a distilling flask and the benzene
          is removed under diminished pressure. The red semi-solid residue is
          suspended in a small amount of ice-cold ether and filtered through a
          chilled funnel. The crystalline product, after washing with small portions
          of cold ether, weighs 9.7 g. The combined filtrates on standing in refrigerator
          yield more crystals. The total yield is 13.0 g. (48%). After four recrystallizations
          from benzene, colorless needles are obtained; m.p. 60-62°C.</p>
        <p>This compound is extremely soluble in ether, alcohol and acetone, but
          slightly soluble in petroleum ether. Standing at room temperature for
          a few weeks causes the crystals to turn into a red semi-solid. An alcoholic
          solution of pure material gives an instantaneous precipitation with
          alcoholic silver nitrate.</p>
        <p> <strong>3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile</strong></p>
        <p>A mixture of 9 g. of potassium cyanide in 35 ml. of water and 60 ml.
          of methanol and 9.7 g. of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl chloride is heated
          for 10 minutes at 90'. The solvents are partially removed under diminished
          pressure. The residue is then extracted with 90 ml. of ether in three
          portions. The combined extracts are washed with water and dried over
          sodium sulfate. After the removal of the drying agent the ether solution
          is warmed on a steam-bath and the ether is removed with a stream of
          air. On chilling, the residue yields scale-like crystals. Recrystallization
          from ether gives rectangular prism; yield 2.5 g. (27%); m.p. 76-77°C.
          Baker and Robinson<a href="mescaline.tsao.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> reported a melting point of 77°C for this compound.</p>
        <p><strong>Mescaline</strong></p>
        <p>In 150 ml. of anhydrous ether is suspended 0.85 g. of lithium aluminum
          hydride powder. With stirring, 2.0 g. of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile
          in 150 ml. of anhydrous ether was added during the course of 15 minutes.
          After 15 minutes stirring, 10 ml. of ice-water is dropped in carefully.
          Then a mixture of 10 g. of sulfuric acid in 40 ml. of water is added
          at a moderate rate. The aqueous layer is separated and treated with
          concentrated sodium hydroxide. The brown off is extracted with three
          portions of 30 ml. each of ether. The combined extracts are washed once
          with water and dried over stick potassium hydroxide. To the decanted
          ether solution is added a mixture of 1 g. of sulfuric acid and 25 ml.
          of ether. The white precipitate is washed several times with ether;
          yield 1.2 g. (40%). After two recrystallizations from 95% ethanol, the
          colorless long thin plates soften at 172°C and melt at 183°C.</p>
