<p>

Acid chlorides can be easily converted to aldehydes by reductive
oxidation using LAH and Pyridinum chlorochromate (PCC) or Pyridinum
dichromate (PDC). Since this procedure uses no exotic or watched
chemicals and since yields are pretty good, this might be another way
to our beloved aldehydes.<sup><a href="aldehydes.red-ox.html#1">1</a></sup>

</p>

<b>Experimental section</b>

<p>

All reaction were performed under a dry N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. All
chemicals used were commercial products of the highest purity
available; THF was dried over 4 A molecular sieve and distilled from
sodium-benzophenone ketyl prior to use. Methylene chloride was also
dried over P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> and distilled. <sup>1</sup>H
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 300 spectrometer. Gas
chromatographic analyses were carried out with a Varian 3300
Chromatograph.

    <b>Reductive Oxidation of Acid Chlorides to Aldehydes</b>

<p>

The following reaction is typical of the procedure utilized in such
conversion with PCC. A solution of lithium aluminum hydride (1.0 M,
31mL, 31 mmol) in THF was placed in an oven-dried, 500-mL flask fitted
with a side-arm and a reflux condenser leading to a mercury bubbler.
To this solution 8.57g (61 mmol) of benzoyl chloride was added
dropwise with vigorous stirring at 0�C and the mixture was stirred
further for 3 hours at room temperature. To a well stirred solution of
PCC (14.5g, 67 mmol) in methylene chloride (120mL) taken in a 500-mL
flask equipped as described above, was added dropwise the above
reaction mixture in THF using a cannula. The mixture was stirred for 3
hours at room temperature. GC analysis of aliquot using tridecane as
an internal standard indicated a yield of 98%.

</p>

<b>Isolation of Aldehyde Products</b>

<p>

The rest of reaction mixture (60 mmol) was diluted with ethyl ether
(120mL) and the supernatant liquid is then filtered through Florisil�
(120g) contained in a 300-mL sintered glass funnel. The solid residue
was triturated with ethyl ether (3 � 30mL) and passed through the same
Florisil column. The filtrate is concentrated and distilled under
reduced pressure to give 5.2g (82%) of pure benzaldehyde, bp 62-63�C
(14 mmHg, np22 1.5450).

</p>

<p>

<b>Experimental procedure</b>

</p>

<p>

The following experimental procedure is illustrative. To an
oven-dried, nitrogen-flushed 100-mL RB flask, fitted with a septum
inlet, a magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser leading to a
mercury bubbler, a 1.10 M solution of aluminum hydride (18.2mL, 20
mmol) in THF was injected and the solution was kept at 0�C with aid of
an ice-water bath. The mixture was stirred at 0�C and a 3.0 M solution
of 1-octanol (20mL, 60 mmol) was added dropwise with a syringe. After
the addition was complete, the mixture was then allowed to room
temperature and stirred for 3 h. In another oven-dried,
nitrogen-flushed 500-mL RB flask, fitted with a septum inlet, a
magnetic stirring bar, and reflux condenser leading to a mercury
bubbler, are placed powdered PCC (26g, 120 mmol) and methylene
chloride (200mL). To the well-stirred suspension, a solution of
trioctylaluminum in THF thus prepared was added with the aid of a
double-ended needle. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1
h. Then, ethyl ether (200mL) was added and the mixture was filtered
through a column containing Florisil<sup>�</sup>. The solid residue in
the flask was triturated with ethyl ether (3 � 50mL) and filtered
through the same Florisil column. The combined filtrate was
concentrated and distilled to afford 6.04g of pure octanal (78%); bp
170-172�C/761 mmHg. The purity was further confirmed by GC
analysis.<br>   A small scale of same reaction (trioctylaluminum, 1
mmol) was also performed and tridecane was added as an internal
standard. The product aldehyde was analyzed by GC with use of a
Carbowax TAP capillary column (25 m) to show 97% octanal formation.

by Oxidation of Alkoxyaluminum Intermediate with Pyridinum

</p>

<p>

<b>Experimental procedure</b>

</p>

<p>

This method provides another convenient procedure for the direct
conversion of carboxylic acids to corresponding aldehydes. The
following procedure for the reaction of hexanoic acid is
representative. An oven-dried, 250-mL RB flask with sidearm, equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser, was attached to a
mercury bubbler. The flask was flushed with dry nitrogen and then
maintained under a static pressure of nitrogen. The flask was charged
with hexanoic acid (6.97g, 60 mmol) and 30mL of THF. The flask was
immersed in an ice-water bath and a pre-cooled 1.0 M solution of
aluminum hydride (30mL, 30 mmol) in THF was added dropwise with
vigorous stirring. After the complete evolution of the hydrogen, the
ice-water bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30
min at room temperature.

</p>

<p>

To a well-stirred suspension of PCC (14.3g, 66 mmol) in methylene
chloride (100mL) taken in a 500-mL RB flask equipped as described
above, is added dropwise the above solution of alkoxyaluminum
intermediate in THF using a cannula. The mixture was stirred for 12 h
at room temperature. The small portion of this mixture was transfered
to a vial and dodecane was added as an internal standard. GC analysis
using a Carbowax 20 M capillary column (20 m) showed a presence of
hexanal in a yield of 96%. The reaction mixture was diluted with 200mL
of diethyl ether and the supernatant liquid is filtered through
Florisil<sup>�</sup> (100g) contained in a 300-mL sintered glass
funnel. The solid residue is washed with diethyl ether (3 � 50mL) and
passed through the same Florisil column. The filtrate was concentrated
and distilled to afford pure hexanal (4.93g, 82% yield); bp 129-130�C
(754 mmHg).

</p>

<p>

Analogous procedures are used for the synthesis of the other aldehydes
listed in Table 1. In the case of PDC as an oxidant used, actually the
same procedure was adopted except the oxidation time.

<p>

This method provides another convenient procedure, which is superior
to many of the procedures previously utilized.

</p>

<p>

<b>Experimental procedure</b>

</p>

<p>

The following procedure for the reaction of ethyl benzoate with PCC is
representative. An oven-dried, 250-mL RB flask, fitted with a side arm
and a reflux condenser connected to a mercury bubbler, was flushed
with dry nitrogen and then maintained under a static pressure of
nitrogen. The flask was charged with 1.0 M solution of aluminum
hydride (61mL, 61 mmol) in THF. To the stirred solution at room
temperature, ethyl benzoate (9.61g, 61 mmol) was added dropwise and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour. To a well stirred
suspension of PCC (28.5g, 132 mmol) in methylene chloride (200mL)
taken in a 500-mL flask equipped as described above, was added
dropwise to the above solution of alkoxyaluminum intermediate in THF
using a cannula. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature.
The small portion of this mixture was transferred to a vial and
dodecane was added as an internal standard. GC using a capillary
column of Carbowax 20 M indicated the presence of benzaldehyde in a
yield of 99%.

</p>

<p>

The rest of the reaction mixture (60 mmol) was diluted with diethyl
ether (200mL). The supernatant liquid was filtered through
Florisil<sup>�</sup> (200g) contained in a 300-mL sintered glass
funnel; the solid was triturated with ethyl ether (3 � 50mL) and
passed through the same column. The filtrate was concentrated and
distilled under reduced pressure to give pure benzaldehyde (5.22g,
82%), bp 62-63� C (15 mmHg).

</p>

<p>

Analogous procedure is used for the synthesis of the other aldehydes.
In the case of PDC as an oxidant used, actually the same procedure was
adopted.
