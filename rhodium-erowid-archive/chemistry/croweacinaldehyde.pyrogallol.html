<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>2-Methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (croweacinaldehyde) of high purity was prepared in 55% overall yield from pyrogallol.</p>
</div>

<p>The title compound, 2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (croweacinaldehyde, <strong>1</strong>), was first obtained as an oxidative 
degradation product of 1-allyl-2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene (croweacin) occurring in the essential oil separated from 
the leaves and terminal branchlets of <em>Eriostemon crowei</em><a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. At the same time, <strong>1</strong> was synthesized from 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin 
(daphnetin) to confirm the structure.	This aldehyde <strong>1</strong> has been used as a key intermediate for syntheses of a variety of 
natural products<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>2,3b</sup></a> Among several routes in the preparation of <strong>1</strong><a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>1,3</sup></a>, formylation of 1-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene 
(<strong>4</strong>) seems to be the most straightforward method although the isolated yield of <strong>1</strong> by recrystallization is relatively low 
because of the formation of the undesirable isomer <strong>5</strong>. Compound <strong>4</strong> has been conveniently prepared by methylenation of 
3-methoxypyrocatechol (<strong>3</strong>) which was derived from o-vanillin (2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde)<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. But this method is not 
suitable for large-scale preparation because o-vanillin, which is usually obtained as a byproduct of the production of 
vanillin, is not easily available in quantity.</p>

<p>Pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>) would be a good alternative to o-vanillin because it can be supplied in large quantities at reasonable 
cost. However, monomethylation of pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>) has been reported to give <strong>3</strong> in very low yield<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>4b</sup></a>, and preparation of <strong>3 </strong>by methylation of 2,3-carbonyldioxyphenol with diazomethane and subsequent hydrolysis<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> is also not suitable for large-scale 
production.</p>


<p>Since we needed a large quantity of <strong>1</strong> of high purity for the synthesis of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4-methoxy-6- methyl-1,3-dioxolo<em>[4,5-g]</em>isoquinolin-5-ol 
(<em>cotarnine</em>)<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, new processes to obtain <strong>1</strong> from pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>) were investigated.	Here, we report the efficient synthesis of 
<strong>1</strong> from pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>).	The synthesis involves recovery of <strong>4</strong> by decarbonylation of the undesirable isomer <strong>5</strong> formed by formylation.</p>

<p>Scheline<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> reported the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid from methyl gallate by the blocking of two vicinal 
hydroxyl groups in aqueous borax solution. He used a large excess of dimethyl sulfate as methylating reagent in large 
reaction volume. Through a modification of his procedure, pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>) was selectively methylated with 1.5 equivalent 
dimethyl sulfate in boric acid solution. The pH of the solution was maintained at 10.0-10.4 by the addition of NaOH during 
the methylation. Yield of <strong>3</strong> was 84% (HPLC analysis), and 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, 2,3- and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol were detected 
as byproducts. Reaction condition out of this pH range required more dimethyl sulfate. The aqueous alkaline solution of 
crude <strong>3</strong> after the addition of NaOH was washed with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> to remove 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene and then methylenated in a 
boiling mixture of CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and Bu<sub>4</sub>NBr as a phase transfer catalyst<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>. Extracts of the reaction mixture were purified 
by distillation under reduced pressure to give pure <strong>4</strong> in 69% isolated yield from pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>). Dimethoxyphenols might be 
methylenated in an intermolecular fashion<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a>, and the resultant products could be removed by distillation.</p>

<p>Although there are many reports on the Vilsmeier formylation of <strong>4</strong><a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>,  we have thoroughly reinvestigated the factors 
affecting the selectivity of formylation, because small changes of selectivity greatly affect the isolated yield of <strong>1</strong> by 
recrystallization. We found that the combination of N-methyl-formanilide and POCl<sub>3</sub> was best for the formylation, and the 
optimal reaction temperature was 35-40�C. Under these reaction conditions, the formation ratio of <strong>1</strong> to <strong>5</strong> was 72 to 28. 
Reaction with other formylating reagents such as DMF-POCl<sub>3</sub>, or reaction at higher temperature resulted in a lower ratio. 
The reaction mixture was poured into ice water, and a mixture of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>5</strong> (1:5 = 74:26, <strong>5</strong> is more soluble than <strong>1</strong> in H<sub>2</sub>O) 
was obtained in total 93% yield. This mixture was recrystallized from 40% MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> at 50�C to give <strong>1</strong> of 99% purity in 
54% yield from <strong>4</strong>. Solubility of <strong>5</strong> in 40% MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O is greater than that of <strong>1</strong>, and the solubility ratio of <strong>5</strong> to <strong>1</strong> at 50�C 
is greater than that at room temperature.</p>

<p>From the cooled mother liquor, the mixture of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>5</strong> (36:64) was recovered in 35% yield based on <strong>4</strong>. This mixture was 
easily decarbonylated<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a> at 200�C over 5% Pd on carbon (0.5 mol%) to afford <strong>4</strong> in 92% yield, which would again be used 
for formylation.</p>

<p>In these processes a desired <strong>1</strong> of high enough purity for further use<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> was prepared in 55% overall yield from pyrogallol 
(<strong>2</strong>) in combination with recovery of <strong>4</strong> from the mixture of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>5</strong> by decarbonylation.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu LC-6A liquid chromatograph 
equipped with a Nucleosil ODS column (4.6 mm x 25 cm) and a UV detector, and operated at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a 
solvent composed of MeCN-H<sub>2</sub>O-AcOH (30:70:5) or MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O (40:60).</p>

<p><strong>3-Methoxypyrocatechol (3)</strong></p>

<p>To a stirred solution of pyrogallol (<strong>2</strong>) (12.61 g, 0.1 mol) and boric acid (6.80 g, 0.11 mol) in 1 N NaOH (110 mL) was 
added dimethyl sulfate (4.72 mL, 0.05 mol) at 20-25�C, and the pH of the solution was maintained at 10.0-10.4 during the 
reaction by the addition of 25% NaOH. Two portions of dimethyl sulfate (2x4.72 mL, 0.1 mol) were added after 20 min and 
then 60 min, and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 2 h.	In total 24 g (0.15 mol) of 25% NaOH was added.	After 
another addition of 25% NaOH (32 g, 0.2 mol), the entire mixture was washed with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2x30 mL) to remove 
1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene. The resultant aqueous alkaline solution of 3-methoxypyrocatechol (<strong>3</strong>) was used in the next step.</p>

<p><strong>1-Methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene (4)</strong></p>

<p>To a refluxing mixture of dibromomethane (34.76 g, 0.2 mol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (1.61 g, 0.005 mol), and H<sub>2</sub>O 
(20.7 mL) was added dropwise the alkaline solution of 3-methoxypyrocatechol (<strong>3</strong>) prepared above over a period of 4 h. 
The reaction mixture was further refluxed for 1 h, cooled, and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2x50 mL). The combined extracts 
were dried over anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and concentrated. The residual oil was distilled under reduced pressure to give pure 
1-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene (<strong>4</strong>) (10.44 g, 69% yield from <strong>1</strong>) as a clear oil which solidified readily; bp 120-122�C 
at 21 mmHg (lit.<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> 82�C/2 mmHg), mp 41�C (lit.<a href="croweacinaldehyde.pyrogallol.html#refs"><sup>4b</sup></a> 41�C).</p>

<p><strong>2-Methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (1)</strong></p>

<p>To a mixture of <strong>4</strong> (15.22 g, 0.1 mol) and N-methylformanilide (20.28 g, 0.15 mol) was added dropwise POCl<sub>3</sub> (13.98 mL, 
0.15 mol) over a period of 20 min at 35-38�C. The mixture was stirred at 35-38�C for 5 h, then at 50�C for 1.5 h, and 
poured into ice water (236 g) with stirring.	After the mixture had been further stirred for 1 h at 20-25�C, the 
deposited solid was collected by filtration, washed with H<sub>2</sub>O (2x74 mL), and dried at 40�C in vacuo to give 17.46g of 
an almost white solid, which contained 12.32 g of <strong>1</strong> and 4.42g of <strong>5</strong> (HPLC analysis, 93% combined yield). To a solution 
of the crude product (17.05 g) in MeOH (101 mL) was added dropwise H<sub>2</sub>O (150 mL) at 60�C, and then the mixture was stirred 
at 50�C for 2 h. The white crystal was collected by filtration, washed with 40% MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O (20 mL) at 50�C, and dried in 
vacuo to afford <strong>1</strong> (9.61 g, 99% pure, 54% yield from <strong>4</strong>) ; mp 103�C (lit. 104�C). The mother liquor was cooled to 5�C, 
and the deposited solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold 40% MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O (40 mL). The product was dried 
to give the mixture of <strong>4</strong> and <strong>5</strong> as slightly yellow needles (6.23 g, 35% yield from <strong>4</strong>, 1:5 = 36:64). </p>

<p><strong>1-Methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzene (4) by decarbonylation of the mixture of 1 and 5</strong></p>

<p>The recovered mixture of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>5</strong> (5.41 g, 0.03 mol) with 5% Pd on carbon (0.32 g) was gradually heated to 200�C and 
stirred at this temperature for 2 h. After cooling, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (30 mL) was added, and Pd on carbon was removed by filtration. 
The filtrate was concentrated and the residual oil was distilled under reduced pressure to give pure <strong>4</strong> (4.20 g, 92% Yield);
bp 130�C/25 mmHg.</p>
