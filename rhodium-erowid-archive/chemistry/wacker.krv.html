        <p> </p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p> The Wacker process has been widely documented since the 1960s and
          is a relatively simple and easy process to perform. With respect to
          our desires, we are looking to take our olefin (safrole) and hydrogenize
          it (add an oxygen group). To do this we will be using a catalyst in
          the form of palladium (II) chloride (PdCl2). To help the palladium chloride
          do its job, we also require a co-catalyst. In this case, we'll be using
          cupric chloride (CuCl2). Copper chloride (CuCl) cannot be used in the
          procedure outlined here as it does not dissolve in methanol (MeOH) or
          ethanol (EtOH) and thus does not form the required complex. If you wish
          to use CuCl you would have to perform the following reaction in dimethylformamide
          (DMF) which tends to be more expensive and not quite as easily obtainable
          as MeOH or EtOH.</p>
        <p>I've chosen to outline the method at a relatively small scale - a scale
          that would be suitable for personal research in a country that sanctioned
          this. You can probably use the same procedure to process 100mL or maybe
          even 150mL of olefin. Do be aware that processing more olefin requires
          even more air refills and more shaking.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Building the KRV (Ketone Reaction Vessel)</h3>
        <p>The original inspiration goes to spiceboy and a big nod to him. You'll
          require:</p>
        <p>- A 2L soda bottle* - Tubeless tire valve (1.25" variety seems to work
          nicely) </p>
        <p>- Something to melt the bottle cap plastic with (candle, lighter, etc).
        </p>
        <p>- Car tire pump (hand, foot, battery, electric operated -- you pick)</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note</b></font>: Barq's root beer or cream
          soda bottles are the authors favorites. They have smooth sides unlike
          the contoured sides of a Coke bottle and thus are less prone to rupture
          due fatigue. Plus they're clear allowing you to easily see what's going
          on inside.</p>
        <p>Take your soda bottle and wash it THOROUGHLY in warm water and soap.
          Do not use water that is too hot. The label should gracefully fall off
          during the washing process. Do not place the cap back on the bottle
          after washing -- the warm air inside will contract as it cools causing
          the bottle to deform. Why is ketone harping-on about deforming so much?
          Well, it's like this kids. If the bottle deforms you're causing fissures
          to form in the plastic. You may not even be able to see them. Pump this
          baby up to pressure and BOOM!!! You may just create a pressure bomb
          that distributes a nice corrosive solution around your lovely home or
          over your body.</p>
        <p>The next bit can be a bit tricky. You need to take that tubeless tire
          valve and insert it into the neck of the bottle. You may need to squeeze
          the rubber surround a bit to soften it up. It should fit very snuggly
          in the neck of the bottle. If it doesn't, go find a valve that will.
          Where I live, I was able to buy two packs of suitable valves for less
          than $4. Get several if you can.</p>
        <p>Taking the bottle cap, remove the plastic liner that's inside the cap
          and throw it away. Apply heat from a candle to the top of the cap so
          that you can poke a hole in the soft plastic that the valve can poke
          through. BE CAREFUL! Hot plastic is napalm!!!.</p>
        <p>Once you have a suitable hole in the cap, screw it down on the bottle
          so that the valve is secured but the valve threading protrudes through
          the cap allowing you to attach the tire pump. Pressurize the KRV to
          40psi.</p>
        <p>Fill a bucket or bath with water and place the KRV into the water.
          Squeeze gently. See a stream of bubbles? Nope? Good. If you do see bubbles
          you obviously have a leak that needs to be fixed.</p>
        <p>You now have a KRV. Congratulations. He will serve your faitfully for
          several reactions.</p>
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>The Chemical Part</h3>
        <p>The beauty of this reaction is it can be done with easily obtainable
          chemicals. PdCl2 is used in specialist photography (see my PdCl2 FAQ),
          cupric chloride can be made at a pinch but is not at all suspicious
          to buy, methanol and ethanol are often available at hardware or automotive
          stores (look for methanol, methyl alcohol, methyl hydrate, Everclear).</p>
        <p>You will need:</p>
        <p>- 1g palladium chloride (PdCl2)</p>
        <p> - 5g cupric chloride (CuCl2)</p>
        <p> - 250mL methanol (MeOH) or ethanol (EtOH) </p>
        <p>- 50mL safrole</p>
        <p>A couple of points about these chemicals. Some photography suppliers
          will sell you sodium palladium chloride as a direct replacement for
          palladium chloride. Insist on straight palladium chloride. The most
          common form of CuCl2 is the dihydrate which has two water molecules
          attached to it. If you are using the anhydrous form, there is really
          no need to adjust the amount used as a 3-8 molar excess of CuCl2 is
          what's required.</p>
        <p>If you are using anhydrous solvent you should add 1% (2.5mL) dH2O to
          the reaction. This reaction needs a bit of water to perform. If you're
          using anhydrous CuCl2 and not CuCl2.2H2O, add another 2.5mL of dH2O.</p>
        <p>With respect to our favorite olefin, remember that garbage in equals
          garbage out. You should at least single distill to obtain relatively
          pure olefin. The other products in the oil have the capability to interfere
          with this reaction.</p>
        <p>Take a glass, beaker, or flask and pour 100mL of solvent into it. Then
          add the 1g of PdCl2. If you have a magenetic stirrer, toss in a stir
          bar and let it stir for a bit (a bit is 15-30 minutes is normally good
          enough). The solution should turn a dirty brown color. DO NOT WORRY
          IF IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY DISSOLVE. Pour this liquid into the soda bottle.</p>
        <p>Take the 5g of cupric chloride and throw it into the same beaker. You
          don't even need to wash it. Add 50mL of solvent and the cupric chloride
          should easily dissolve giving a bright green fluid. This gets poured
          into the soda bottle too.</p>
        <p>Take that very same beaker and pour your safrole into it along with
          the remaining 100mL of solvent. Stir. Pour into the soda bottle. Add
          parsley. Serves two.</p>
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>Shake, Rattle'n'Roll</h3>
        <p>Now that you have all the goodies in the soda bottle, it's time to
          put the tubeless tire valve in the bottle neck and secure it with the
          modifed bottle cap. Be careful not to push the tire valve all the way
          through!</p>
        <p>You're now ready to charge the bottle with air. Take your trusty pump
          and attach it to the valve. Pump until you have around 40psi in the
          bottle. You don't *need* that much pressure, what you really need is
          an large oxygen reserve and anything over atmospheric pressure. However,
          compressing the air gives you a large reserve of oxygen close to hand
          and also provides the pressure required.</p>
        <p>Shake the bottle like crazy. How crazy? Well, you should see foam appear
          as you shake. Ideally, shake for at least 5 minutes. Preferably 10 minutes.The
          shaking is VERY important in this reaction, the more you do the better.</p>
        <p>After shaking let the bottle stand for 20 minutes. De-pressurize the
          KRV and squeeze the bottle to expell all the gas inside. Some nasty
          gasses form during this reaction, and you want to get them out of the
          KRV. With a little bit of skill you can hold the valve open while you
          squeeze-release-squeeze the bottle a few times to pump the gasses out.
          Alternatively, you can remove the valve and the cap and remove the gasses
          that way, but it gets a little tiresome.</p>
        <p>Replace the valve and cap if necessary and re-pressurize to ~40psi.
          Shake again for at least 5 minutes. You will need to repeat this no
          less than 10 times at this scale. This reaction is time dependant too
          meaning that if you think you can get away with re-pressurizing once
          per day for 10-days and get the same results, you won't. What will happen
          is that you either won't get enough O2 into the olefin, or you will
          run out of O2 resulting in side products being formed instead of the
          ketone.Do the whole thing in a day including work-up of the final ketone
          and you'll be a happy camper.</p>
        <p>Infact, if you can handle more shaking and more re-pressurizations
          at shorter time intervals you'll probably increase your yield and have
          a higher assurrance of getting final product.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Work It On Up</h3>
        <p>When you're arms are falling off and you've re-pressurized at 10 times
          or so, add 500mL of distilled water (dH2O) to the solution in the bottle.
          This should be enough to precipitate the catalyst out of solution because
          the contents of the flask should already be acidic.</p>
        <p>If you have a buchner funnel and vacuum source, filter this solution
          a couple of times to remove the catalyst. If you don't have a buchner
          and vacuum source, you can improvise with coffee filter and gravity.</p>
        <p>The solution should now be relatively free of PdCl2 and CuCl2. You
          can extract the goodies from this solution using your favorite organic
          solvent. I quite like DCM (dichloromenthane) but you could also use
          ether or petroleum ether. Add 50mL of DCM (or ether or petroleum ether)
          to the solution, extract and repeat two or three times to get all the
          good stuff. Combine the extracts and then remove the solvent either
          under vacuum or at atmospheric pressure.</p>
        <p>Once you've removed the solvent you'll be left with crude ketone which
          might well have some tar, isosafrole and other junk in it. If you have
          vacuum distillation equipment, then this is the optimum way to purify
          the crude ketone. If not, I'm afraid the bisulfite procedure is probably
          your only hope. It's pretty messy and you will lose some product doing
          it, but clean ketone is a good starting point for any amination or reduction.</p>
        <p>And that's it. A simple, fairly inexpensive, easy to do reaction for
          making MD-P2P. Enjoy.</p>

<h4>MDP2P production using the Spiceboy SRV/KRV</h4>
<p>by Spiceboy</p>
        </center>
<hr>

<p><b>Question:</b> Why is everyone afraid of pressure reactions? 'Cause they're dangerous, right? Well, somewhat, yes, No more so than many other things, tho.</p>

<p>After having listened closely to Osmiums tales of power about his pressure
dreams, I meditated on the problem and came up with a WHOLE NEW APPROACH to an
old problem. I didnt want to use a champagne bottle because of a few different
reasons, most of them having to do with it being glass. Plus you cant see color
changes thru a green bottle. Well get ready everyone for a new dawn...
Introducing the SRV (Spice Reactor Vessel) a 'ketone generator, if you will,
its so simple that you'll scream....</p>

<p>What you need: one 2 L coke bottle. One valve stem for a car tire. I found it
easily... fits in the neck tightly... what you have to do is squeeze the base
and deform the rubber to a slight oblong shape. You will be able to pull the
stem up and cork the bottle with it from the inside out, if you will. This is
your pressure vessel. It is very easy to wire the stem in using the nice wide
collar that runs around the top of the bottle. Try to visualize. I have
tested the apparatus to 2.5 atm successfully. At about 40lbs the fuckin thing
BLEW THE VALVE STEM OUT of the bottle like a .60 cal. shell. I never did find
it. Oh well, they're only a buck. Thats why I mention wire. Anyway this is the
setup for the dream that is my next post, on the novel page, entitled LET THERE
BE KETONE...</p>


<h4>Part 2: Let there be ketone</h4>

<p>I want to thank Osmium for the original inspiration.</p>

<p>This process will allow the reacting of one hundred grams of olefin w/ 2g of
PdCl2, and 8g of CuCl2. There will be no oxygen tank. The reference the main
part of this is based on indicate that air will serve as an able reoxidant,
and it will.</p>

<p>The SRV is pressurized with a tire pump. (37-40 psi)</p>

<ul>
<li>Dissolve 8 g CuCl2 in 80 ml MeOH.
<li>Dissolve 2 g PDCl2 in 40-50 ml MeOH.
<li>Mix 100 ml safrole w/ 200 ml MeOH.
<li>Pour it all in and add methanol to make 500 ml.
<li>Swirl and shake to mix.
<li>Pressurize to 40 psi.
<li>Shake like hell for 15-20 mins, repeat this hourly or more.
</ul>

<p>ORIGINAL REACTION RAN 21 HRS W/ 6-8 HRS STANDING TIME IN THE COOL.
So, actually, it ran about 14 hrs, w/ about 7 hrs standing.</p>

<p>Dont heat this stuff in any way while preparing. Heat favors aldehydes.
The refs say that isomerization is decreased with control over 2 factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>you must keep the oxygen available.
<li>you must keep it cool. Not cold, just cool...say around 20�C or so.
</ol>

<p>Contents are already acid, usually, but I like to hit it w/ some dilute acid
before extraction.</p>

<p>This method is pretty close to OTC, and represents much testing and research.
Not everyone had immediate results with it, but it is a very viable method.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is an update on the SRV concept, including a detailed run w/ the unit.
In this dream the ratios were as:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 g PdCl2
<li>6 g CuCl2
<li>250 ml denatured alcohol
<li>50 ml ultra clean, vac distilled safrole
</ul>

<p>After mixing the copper salt w/ alcohol, it was chucked in the SRV.</p>

<p>Same for the PdCl2. Its probably better to put the palladium directly in
the SRV via funnel, than to put it in a separate beaker and trying to do
the mixing beforehand. The reason why is that the shit sticks to the beaker
and is hard to recover when transferring containers.</p>

<p>When you get it all in there, assemble the unit and THROW IN A STIRBAR
before you plug it up with the valve stem...this is a minor improvement
that makes a BIG difference, because it enables you to get a much more
turbulent agitation of the mixture...and that increases the oxygen uptake
dramatically.</p>

<p>This was done next;</p>

<p>Plug the unit. Pressurize it w/ the pump.</p>

<p>I have found that you cannot run the electric tire pumps off of a small
battery charger because it doesn't have the amps. Go out to your car and
pressurize on the ground beside it. Or take a car battery and set up a work
station at a bench, whatever.</p>

<p>Pressurize it for ten seconds. Shake it. Presurrize more. Shake it.
Pressurize it until it rock hard, all the while shaking strongly. You can
get a really good swirling-shaking action going on with the stir bar inside
of the unit. If you think about it, this is the principle that engineers
use to package spray paints in such a way that the contents can be readily
mixed, while being under pressure. I really cant emphasize enough the
difference this made in my dream. Your shaking effort is actually reduced,
while your mixing efficiency is exponentially increased. Shake some more.</p>

<p>I shook the unit vigorously, nonstop for two hours. Well, stopped every
ten minutes to relieve gases, and purge. Squeeze it while holding the valve
open,and purge two or three times. Away from your face. Have cold water
nearby to immerse the unit in intermittently, while repressurizing.
This improves uptake. Shake it. Shake it. See?</p>

<p>When you first place everything in the unit, the stuff is a light,
green-brown-golden. It evolves to gold-brown, then brown, then brick-red
at the end. Really hard shaking was used, and never let up on.</p>

<p>At the end, when it was brick red, I noticed a fine suspension of Pd
particles. Then, would purge and add new air. The particles would go away
for a short time and come back, so this was done a few times, and ,
evidently, as the reaction finished, the catalyst QUIT GOING BACK INTO
SOLUTION and would deposit as a fine, granular silt on the sides of the SRV
as you slowly rotate it.</p>

<p>The character of the solution seemed to change right about the time the
shit went from brown to dark red, too. It seemed less viscous, and kinda
acted like it was more easily agitated. I dont know how objective Im being
here, just thiught I'd add that.</p>

<p>Remember, Shake It Real Hard. There were vertical cracks appearing in the
unit at the end of the Rx, indicating that it was a hearty shaking affair,
replete with purge and binge...</p>

<p>Make up dilute acid. Others have said that it's not needed, but in my
dreams a much more efficient separation is achieved with dilute HCl being
used to bust everything up. Hit the stuff with about 200-300 ml of this.
It gets cloudy and tan-crap-greenish color and a HEAVY RED OIL falls out to
the bottom. But its full of catalyst. Get the buchner funnel and your
patience together. Assemble them. Filter all this crap about 3-4 times with
the paper I have, don't know about you. A clear red oil is obtained, and
believe it or not, ZERO TAR. ZERO.</p>

<p>The result? 37 ml of ketone from 50 ml safrole. Thats over 70%. Its
repeatable. It IS NOT A FLUKE. There was extremely little iso and even less
unconverted olefin. Removing the catalyst is a bitch, but its not really
bad. You do need vaccuum. It seems like denatured ethanol is superior, in
my dreams, to methanol as a substrate.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it. If anyone is not afraid of shaking for two hours,
this is a very viable way to get the stuff.....</p>

<p>Low temps seem to favor a better all-round set of kinetics for this reaction.</p>

<p><b>Addendum:</b></p>

<p>After about 45 minutes of prssure/ shaking, 2ml of water was added to the
mixture. This detail was added because it *may* have been important to
anyone else finding themselves in this dream. It maybe wasn't necessary,
but I have no way of knowing if/how much water is in the denatured (slx)
alcohol. The dihydrate was used, salt-wise.</p>

<p>Well the final distilled product from these wacker/SRV's is a light, clear
yellow-green. It comes over @170-175�C. It smells weird, too... post-purity
yield is 55%-60%....some messy technique. also, it glows a real cool green
under black light,too...</p>

<p>The ONE REAL criteria in these reactions is the O2: Pd, IMHO. With more Pd,
your results improve. With air, use less Pd. But air makes it easy for anyone.</p>

<p><b>This is a major finding in the sequence of SRV-type reactions.</b></p>

<p>I have found that in the using of Pd powered Wacker oxidations that there
is a 'window' of Pd amount used that greatly influences factors such as
pressure and shaking, and generally makes the air Wacker a little hard to
predict.</p>

<p>I will tell you this;</p>

<p>Using 1 g Pd to 50 g alkene WILL produce MDP2P, but ONLY if you put out
your MAX effort when it comes to shaking, and you make a TOP effort to keep
the purge/binge thingy rollin'...(lotta air.A L O T )</p>

<p>If you do not perform with great vigor, you may not achieve conversion. I
was confused when my new found reaction only returned the safrole to me one
night, and I began wondering why...then I remembered that BIG HUMONGOUS
SKUNK joint that I smoked, and that, due to it, I really didn't get the
full focus of my att'n span goin' on, so, was a little lax in the
re-airing, and a little lax in the power of my shaking.</p>

<p>But the colors I posted werent right this time. They werent changing
definitively. After the processing I got my oil back.</p>

<p>I dreamed this dream again, and re-duped my original conditions, with
earth-quake shaking, GONZO repressurizations, and attention to all details.</p>

<p>*POW!* (ketone appears) not the chemist, the chemical....</p>

<p>So, this means that I am onto something. But I am telling you that this is
probably the most physically demanding method you could ever dream up, ...</p>

<p>I started wondering,...hmmm...How about if you could get the results with
your half-ass performance, and not have to feel like you've been at the
deltoid machine at Golds Gym...</p>

<p>This took me back to JOC 34.</p>

<p>and this ratio... 3 g PdCl2 : 18 g CuCl2 (I used 65 g of alkene, double distilled.)</p>

<p>I went the 'wimpy' process, which was still fairly robust shaking, and ,
maybe, 75% of the attention to the re-airing process.</p>

<p>Guess What!?!?</p>

<p>KETONE. Yes there was one BITCH of an emulsion, but good lord, thats a
lotta metal salt. It all cleaned up w/ a few passes thru the ol'
Buchner....</p>

<p>Yield: After the processing, where I estimate I lost 10%, I got back 32 g
of very light yellow oil that smells nothing like safrole. It has a
heavier, softer smell, with an element of something spicy.</p>

<p>So the moral of this story is: Use more Pd and get results that are more consistent.</p>

<p>Again, it WILL work with less, but you will work your ass off...and I am
not sure, but I think I repressurized it (dont have my notes) 32 times.
This was calculated by the volume of the bottle, the amt. of O2 req'd, and
the amt. of O2 in air(~21%)...</p>

<p>If you use 3g I'll just about guarantee it everytime...</p>

<p>Next, there is a dream about the OPTIMIZED SRV, where the bad li'l spice
steals the Farmers oxy-acetylene torch and clamps a hose on the end (w/
about 5 clamps) makes sure only 02 is flowing, takes the CORE out of the
tire valve, clamps on to it, and uses 1 g of Pd to 100 g alkene, per Os,
and that, we shall be reporting....</p>
