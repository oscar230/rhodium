<h2>The 4-Methylaminorex (psuedo) FAQ - improvements to extraction</h2>
<h3>by Eleusis</h3>

<table border="0" width="750">

<p>Here it is again. Some improvements to the PPA extraction process were surmised through empirical testing. A mixed solvent system of 
ethanol and water is now called for, and results in 100% extraction efficiency with super-speedy filtering. This works only for the 
*non-time-release* tablets,. The time release ones are a different story, I am told, and require much more processing time and crap to 
deal with.

<p>Some other changes to help clarify the street nomenclature has also been added due to the e-mail I have received. Enjoy, and remember, 
if you want this to be a *real* FAQ, you guys have to send me more comments.

<h3>The 4-Methylaminorex pseudo-FAQ (beta)</h3>

<p>Due to strangely increased demand for 4-Methylaminorex "recipes" that I have received by mail, I decided to compile a short document with
the cognate preparation of this interesting compound. This may become a full-fledged FAQ in the future, depending on user response and
outside input donated where this will undoubtedly be deficient.

<center><p><b>*STANDARD DISCLAIMER*</b></center>
This is for informational purposes only. It is being produced in order to illustrate the novel structure and effects of the 
aryl-oxazolines. Use this information at your own risk, I cannot be held responsible for what you do with it, etc... and so on.

<br><br><b>Q1. What is Ice?</b>
    
<br><br><b>A1.</b> Ice is a norepinephrine potentiator (neuromodulator class). It has a characteristic look and feel, like white opaque ice,
    		 	 hence the name. Ice is currently a Schedule I drug as designated by the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) which means it is 
			 felt to have NO medical use whatsoever. It was originally researched for appetite suppressant ability, but never pursued, 
			 probably because it's too much fun. Ice is also synonymous with "U4Euh".

<br><br><b>Q2. Can Ice/U4Euh be made from amphetamine/methamphetamine?</b>

<br><br><b>A2.</b>  It is *technically* possible, but requires some backwards motions to get back to a sec. alcohol. At least one 
 			  individual, in a personal communication to me, indicated that "they knew of someone who could convert crank 
			  [methamphetamine] into ice by washing it with something". This is not possible and more than likely is just a 
			  street name for clean crank (meth).

<br><br><b>Q3. What kind of chemical is it?</b>

<br><br><b>A3.</b> In drug parlance, which is notoriously Non-IUPAC compliant, Ice is synonymous with "Euphoria" (U4Euh), 4-Methylaminorex, 
			 or, chemically speaking: dl-cis-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline. This is a tongue twister of a name, so I will 
		   	 explain and illustrate it with a cheap floozie of an ascii drawing.

<p>The numbering starts at the heterocyclic Oxygen and goes counter-clockwise. So the amine is at the 2 position, the methyl is at the
4 position, a phenyl ring is tacked on at the 5 position. Also, the 2-oxazoline part is often merely called oxazoline, as the double
bond to the heterocyclic Nitrogen is implied.

<p>It is interesting to note that all of the stereoisomers of 4-MAR are centrally active <b>[1]</b> (ie - it is not stereospecific in action).


<br><br><b>Q4. What does Ice/U4Euh do?</b>

<br><br><b>A4.</b> The document at Hyperreal.com describing the effects of Euphoria would be a good place to start. Anecdotally, it is said 
		to help concentration and thinking - a sort of "make-you-smarter" drug, with a minor speed-like component to it. Time of action 
            is around 4-6 hours (some say 14-16). Dosage varies but a good start is 20mg for a 150lb individual. It is smoked as the free 
            base or the hydrochloride salt - both have relatively low melting points.


<h3>Cognate Preparation of 4-Methylaminorex</h3>

<h3>Reagents</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Phenylpropanolamine HCl
	<li>Methanol
	<li>Cyanogen Bromide
	<li>Sodium Acetate
	<li>Sodium Carbonate
	<li>Water
	<li>Benzene (or similar)
	<li>Ether
</ul>

<h3>Extraction of Phenylpropanolamine from OTC preparations</h3>

<ol>
	<li> Extract Phenylpropanolamine HCl (PPA) from OTC diet pills by crushing and dissolving in 5mL ethanol and 5mL distilled water
           per gram of PPA. Decant solution onto the Buchner funnel and repeat with 2 more volumes of solvent. Use ethanol/water instead 
           of just water because it has less tendency to form a colloid with any cellulosic binders present which would otherwise 
           severely clog the filter paper.
	<li> Distill off most of the solvent then add cold water to dissolve all of the PPA solids. Basify to approximately pH 9 with 
           10% Sodium Carbonate or Sodium Hydroxide solution. Extract out PPA base using 3 volumes of ether of approximately 1/3 the 
           volume of water. The ethanol will follow into the ether as well, but very little of the formed salt will.
	<li> Distill off ether/ethanol for later recovery of the solvents and weigh the amount of solid PPA base, mp 101C. The amount you 
           process here determines, obviously, the amounts of everything else to use later on.
</ol>

<h3>Forming the Oxazoline Ring</h3>

<p>The ideal ratio of all the reagents is as follows <b>[2]</b>:

<ul>
	<li>1.0 Mole Phenylpropanolamine (MW: 151.2)
	<li>1.1 Moles Cyanogen Bromide (MW: 105.93)
	<li>3.0 Moles of Sodium Acetate (MW: 82.04)
</ul>

<p>The Sodium Acetate may be prepared by carefully adding an equinormal amount of Sodium Hydroxide to glacial Acetic Acid and drying the
resultant salt at 120C for 15 minutes.

<p>The preparation of Cyanogen Bromide is covered in <a href="cnbr.html">another document of mine</a>.

<p>This compound should only be prepared in an area of *adequate* ventillation. A full covering fume hood is ideal (geez - make one, I 
did) or outside with the wind blowing away from you. Cyanogen Bromide acts on cytochrome oxidase just like any other cyanide and can kill 
you quite effectively and quickly. Also, it has been known to decompose spontaneously when impure.

<ol>
	<li> Dissolve 15g (.142M) of Cyanogen Bromide in 50mL of Methanol at 0C.
	<li> Dissolve 19.5g (.129M) of Phenylpropanolamine and 31.8g (.387M) of Sodium Acetate in 300mL of Methanol at 0�C. Place this in 
	     a round bottom flask equipped with a stirrer magnet and addition funnel.
	<li> Add the Cyanogen Bromide solution to the flask though the addition funnel over a period of 15 minutes with stirring.
	<li> React for an additional 45 minutes at 0�C.
	<li> Evaporate solvents at reduced pressure and with gentle water bath heat (50C tops) - do not attempt to recover!
	<li> Dissolve the oily residue in water and then add saturated Sodium Carbonate solution until a white solid precipitates.
	<li> Filter this cake of white solid on the Buchner, then wash twice with ice cold water and dry in a vacuum dessicator.
	<li> Recrystallize the crude dried product from Benzene to yield ~63%.
	<li> *OPTIONAL* - Form the hydrochloride salt by bubbling HCl gas though the Benzene until white crystals fall out or shaking 
	     with 5% HCl and evaporating the water off.
