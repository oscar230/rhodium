        <p>The road to MDMA is paved with good chunks of broken glass so be careful 
          with your feet!</p>
        <p>Lately ZWIT has had some SERIOUS FUCKING PROBLEMS trying to scrounge 
          together a batch of MDMA. What was the cause of 8 consecutive failed 
          runs?!?! Why all the wasted methylamine, ketone and time??? What dark 
          and evil conspirators lurked in the shadows waiting to FUCK ME UP THE 
          ASS AGAIN?!?!</p>
        <p>It was all really quite simple, but the process by which the answer 
          was found illustrates the PROFOUND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE an underground 
          chemist has about the quality of his (and they almost all are HISes) 
          reagents as well as what da fuck he's doing! This tale is possibly the 
          MOST EDUCATIONAL ZWIT WILL EVER POST.</p>
        <p>Pay the fuck attention, damnit!</p>
        <p>ZWIT had secured some new space to conduct his operations, and was 
          feeling the old urge to fire up the glassware once again. The minions 
          were getting fiesty, product was running low, demand was high. No better 
          time to satisfy the screaming lunatics among us who LOVE PURE MDMA. 
          ZWIT's product is well known for it's quality among those in the know, 
          and ZWIT NEVER LET'S THE AFFICIONADO DOWN. Or so ZWIT thought.</p>
        <p>Two batches of isosafrole were made, simultaneously, in a fists of 
          fury tag-team no holds barred fight to the death match. ZWIT vacuum 
          filtered the hot batches and directly distilled to yield an unprecedented 
          190g of "isosafrole". ZWIT, casual in doing this process, did not bother 
          to actually watch the temperature of the reaction vessels, and in combination 
          with vacuum filtering, introduced TWO VARIABLES into an otherwise solid 
          process. ZWIT should have known that a 95% yield was UNPRECEDENTED and 
          likely NOT the result of filtering, but HINDSIGHT IS 20/20, huh?</p>
        <p>Error #1 - Two variables introduced in making isosafrole - result: 
          INCOMPLETE conversion of the safrole to isosafrole.</p>
        <p>ZWIT then started up two simultaneous batches of MDP-2-P at the largest 
          batch size ZWIT's glassware selection could accomodate: 85g of isosafrole 
          processed each. ZWIT was intending on neutralizing the glycol intermediate 
          as per Eleusis's "Improved Method" document, so ZWIT figured a bigger 
          batch wouldn't be a problem (otherwise ZWIT would not be able to distill 
          & concentrate that much volume conveniently). Anyway, things were going 
          NORMALLY, the neutralization went smoothly using 40% NaOH solution, 
          and resulted in a large quantity of the pure glycol ester from each 
          batch. The separate yields of glycol ester were placed into 1L beakers 
          with stir magnets in place, the requisite amount of methanol was added, 
          and as much 15% Sulfuric Acid as could be working on the premise that 
          as it evaporated off over the 3 hour hydrolysis time, more would be 
          added. The beakers were placed in a hot water bath that barely got the 
          core reaction temp up to 75C, but it seemed fine. The smell was different, 
          but ZWIT assumed that this was the result of the "cleaner neutralization" 
          process, as compared to vacuum distillation. So far, in just this process 
          alone, we have racked up 2 variables! Poor form on ZWIT's part!</p>
        <p>After hydrolysis, the solutions were individually neutralized and extracted 
          with CH2Cl2 (2 more variables, total of 4). The solvent was stripped 
          off, flashed with vacuum to get the last bit out, then the vacuum cranked 
          down hard to 10mm Hg and the "yellow oil" distilled off. the distillation 
          range covered from 120-160C, which is unusually WIDE. Normally the range 
          is 145-165C. The product was the familiar yellow oil, had the "right" 
          smell, etc... If I actually had kept some MDP-2-P from a previous batch, 
          though, it would have been obvious that something was seriously wrong!</p>
        <p>Error #2 - 4 freakin' variables were introduced into this process! 
          1) the glycol ester was neutralized with base instead of concentrated 
          under vacuum, 2) the glycol ester was hydrolysed on a water bath which 
          only got the temp up to 75C instead of refluxed in a flask with a heating 
          mantle @ 100C, 3) the post-hydrolysis mixture was neutralized with base 
          instead of extracted & washed and 4) the crude "ketone" was extracted 
          with methylene chloride instead of toluene or ether.</p>
        <p>The result was a homogenous mixture of the alcohol & the ketone.</p>
        <p>No surprise then that the Al-Hg reduction failed, then, huh? But the 
          trickies bastard part of this collection of fuckups is that all the 
          errors pointed to a PROBLEM WITH THE Al-Hg REDUCTION, NOT THE INITIAL 
          SCREWUP WITH THE ISOSAFROLE!!! To further compound the problem, a different 
          brand of Aluminum foil was used! The biggest mystery that faced ZWIT 
          was why E & me's process, which had a screaming yeild up to this point, 
          suddenly dropped by 50% while also making a nasty goo which was nearly 
          impossible to crystallize!?!?! My reasoning and deduction process is 
          listed below, substantially assisted by the venerable bastard himself, 
          e.</p>
        <p>Observations: the almagam reduction gives a 50% yield instead of 85%, 
          the product is oily and difficult to crystallize, a substantial part 
          is lost in the acetone wash, later runs where the freebase was distilled 
          yielded the PROPER AMOUNT OF OIL, the color of the reaction was the 
          same, two layers formed in the flask as usual after vacuum filtering 
          off the oxidized aluminum, the reduction was finished within 3 hours 
          instead of 7, the temperature was unusually easy to control, there weren't 
          too many fumes being made.</p>
        <p>The strangest clue came at batch #6 when ZWIT vacuum distilled the 
          crap left over from solvent washing the post-reduction, post-concentration 
          mixture. What ZWIT found, not surpisingly, was the alcohol!!! E was 
          totally floored by this, saying that there was no way the Al-Hg reduction 
          could reduce the ketone back to the alcohol, but the proof was there, 
          so we thought! E asked about the ketone, and ZWIT told him it looked 
          normal - what else could E do??? He suggested ZWIT try using plain old 
          Reynolds wrap and see if that corrects the problem. No dice, yield was 
          even worse. All this time, ZWIT was prepping the isosafrole with the 
          same carelessness, and the MDP-2-P without modification - ZWIT didn't 
          want to introduce any new variables! Hah!</p>
        <p>Finally, ZWIT started to suspect the ketone, and reverted back to the 
          completely normal way of making it - the result? A much more obviously 
          fucked up product! The ketone was definitely wrong smelling and wrong 
          looking, and yield was horrible. Does this mean the improvements E has 
          made to the process are invalid? Not necessarily, but it does mean the 
          improvements MASK THE PRESENCE OF SAFROLE IN THE ISOSAFROLE!!! Having 
          exhausted every other possibility, requiring 8 consecutive fucked up 
          batches to determine, ZWIT finally produced the ketone successfully 
          by MONITORING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ISOMERIZATION PROCESS THE ENTIRE 
          TIME!!! The isosafrole was then used in the conventional ketone process 
          (ZWIT hasn't gotten around to actually verifying E's improvements with 
          the genuine isosafrole yet) and a side-by-side comparison of the fucked-up 
          ketone with the real ketone showed an obvious difference. The fucked 
          up ketone had a milder smell and was a darker yellow, compared to the 
          pepper-like smell of the real ketone with it's fluorescent green-yellow 
          transparent color. What a tiny amount of difference to detect without 
          side-by-side comparison, though!</p>
        <p>The final test was doing another amalgam reduction, BUT, ZWIT had run 
          out of reagent grade methylamine so had to use some he made following 
          E's process!! ARGH! Two variables once again, but this time the ending 
          was HAPPY!</p>
        <p>34g of MDP-2-P and 38g of the homemade methylamine HCl were reduced 
          to yield 31g of MDMA*HCl doing it completely by the book (Shulgin's 
          book, that is). The product was exceptionally clean, just as expected, 
          and burst into white crystals on the plate when disturbed by a plastic 
          rod. Acetone washing resulted in little improvement in cleanliness (but 
          would have had ZWIT used his improved process of purifying the crude 
          MDMA, which skips the bastard wash & extract steps).</p>
        <p>ZWIT breaths a big sigh of relief!</p>
        <p>In conclusion, it should now be obvious that a fuck-up in the first 
          part of the process has monumental effects in the final product! Pay 
          attention! However, it's nice to see that E finally came up with a process 
          for making methylamine that works AND isn't a pain in the ass! Thanks 
          E for saving ZWIT's ass, more than once. I owe yah.</p>
