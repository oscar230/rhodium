<h3>Synthesis of nitrobenzene [1]</h3>

<center><img src="pictures/nitrobenzene.gif"></center>

<center><strong>This preparation should be conducted in an
efficient fume cupboard.</strong></center>

<p>Place 50 g (35 mL, c. 0.5 mol)of concentrated nitric acid in a
500-mL round-bottomed flask, and add, in portions with shaking, 74
g (40 mL) of concentrated sulfuric acid. Keep the mixture cool
during the addition by immersing the flak in cold water. Place a
thermometer (110 &deg;C range) in the acid mixture. Introduce 26 g
(30 mL, 0.33 mol of benzene (CAUTION) in portions of 2 - 3 mL;
shake the flask well to ensure thorough mixing, after each addition
of benzene. Do not allow the temperature to rise over 55 &deg;C;
immerse the flask, if necessary, in cold water or in ice water.
When all the benzene has been added, fit a reflux condenser to the
flask and heat it in a water bath maintained at 60 &deg;C (but not
appreciably higher) for 40 - 45 minutes; remove the flask from time
to time and shake it vigorously to ensure good mixing of the
immiscible layers. Pour the contents of the flask into about 500 mL
of cold water in a beaker, stir the mixture well in order to wash
out as much acid as possible from the nitrobenzene and allow to
stand. When the nitrobenzene has settled to the bottom, pour of the
acid liquor as completely as possible, and transfer the residual
liquid to a separatory funnel. Run off the lower layer of
nitrobenzene and reject the upper aqueous layer; return the
nitrobenzene to the separatory funnel and shake it vigorously with
about 50 mL of water. Separate the nitrobenzene as completely as
possible and rin it into a small conical flask containing about 5 g
of anhydrous calcium chloride. If the nitrobenzene does not become
clear because of the presence of emulsified water, warm the
mixture, with shaking, for a short period on a water bath; the
cloudiness will soon disappear. Filter the cold product through a
small fluted filter paper into a small (50- or 100-mL)distilling
flask and attach a still-head and air condenser. Heat the flask on
a ceramic-centred wire gauze or preferably in an air bath, and
collect the fraction which boils at 206 - 211 &deg;C. (1). Do not
distill quite to dryness nor allow the temperature to rise above
214 &deg;C, for there may be a residue of m-dinitrobenzene or
higher nitro compounds and an explosion may result. The yield of
nitrobenzene is 35 g (85 %). Pure nitrobenzene is a clear, pale
yellow liquid, B.P. = 210 &deg;C.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(1)</b> Nitrobenzene is appreciably toxic and its vapour
should not be allowed to escape into the atmosphere of the
laboratory. Site the distillation apparatus in a fume cupboard, use
the receiver assembly illustrated in fig. 2.98, and attach to the
outlet of the receiver adapter a piece of rubber tubing leading to
the extraction system. The liquid is also a skin poison, if
accidentally spilled on the skin, it should be removed by washing
with a little methylated spirit, followed by soap and warm
water.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Nitrobenzene Synthesis (alternative)</h3>

<p>Prepare a mixture of 82 mL of 95-100% sulfuric acid and 71 mL of
70% nitric acid in a 500-mL flask. Stir well and allow the mixture
to cool to room temperature in a cold water bath. Gradually add 57
mL of benzene to the acid with frequent shaking. If the temperature
rises above 50-60 &deg;C during the benzene addition, stop adding
benzene and cool the flask in a cold water bath until the
temperature has lowered. After all of the benzene has been added,
reflux the flask in a water bath at 60 &deg;C for 1 hour. The
temperature of the water bath should be 60 &deg;C, not the contents
of the flask. Shake the flask frequently during reflux. After
heating, allow the flask to cool, two layers should form. Transfer
the contents to a separatory funnel and drain off the bottom layer
of sulfuric and nitric acids; the top layer contains the
nitrobenzene. The bottom layer can be disposed of. The nitrobenzene
is then vigorously shaken in the separatory funnel several times
with water. After each shaking, allow the layers to separate, the
nitrobenzene will now be the bottom layer, dispose of the top water
layer. After washing, place the nitrobenzene in a dry Erlenmeyer
flask with some calcium chloride. Heat this flask on a steam bath,
it will first be milky, then it will go clear, stop when it is
clear. The nitrobenzene is now purified by simple distillation.
Yield is about 60-70 g.</p>

<h3>Synthesis of aniline [2]</h3>

<center><img src="pictures/nitrobenzene2aniline.gif"></center>

<p>Into a 500-mL round bottomed flask equipped with a reflux
condenser place 25 g (21 mL, 0.25 mol) of nitrobenzene and 45 g
(0.38 mol) of granulated tin. Measure out 100 mL of concentrated
hydrochloric acid. Pour about 15 mL of this acid down the condenser
and shake the contents of the flask steadily. The mixture becomes
warm and before long the reaction should be quite vigorous; if it
boils very vigorously, moderate the reduction somewhat by
temporarily immersing the flask in cold water. When the initial
reaction slackens of its own accord, pour another 15 mL of
hydrochloric acid down the condenser, shake the flask steadily to
ensure thorough mixing and cool again if the reduction becomes too
violent. Do not cool more than is necessary to keep the reaction
under control; keep the mixture well shaken. Proceed in this way
until all 100 mL of acid has been added. Finally heat the mixture
on a boiling water bath for 30 - 60 minutes, i.e. until the odour
of nitrobenzene is no longer perceptible and a few drops of the
reaction mixture when diluted with water yield a perfectly clear
solution. During the course of the reduction, particularly during
the cooling, aniline chlorostannate may separate as a white or
yellow crystalline complex. Cool the reaction mixture to room
temperature and add gradually a solution of 75 g of sodium
hydroxide in 125 mL of water; if the reaction mixture boils during
the addition of alkali, cool again. The hydroxide of tin which is
first precipitated should all dissolve and the solution should be
strongly alkaline: the aniline separates as an oil. Equip the flask
for steam distillation, and pass steam into the warm mixture until,
after the distillate has ceased to pass over as a turbid liquid, a
further 120 mL of clear liquid are collected. Since aniline is
appreciably soluble (c. 3 %) in water, it must be 'salted out' by
saturating the distillate with salt. Use about 20 g of commercial
salt for each 100 mL of liquid. Transfer the distillate, saturated
with salt, to a separatory funnel, add about 40 mL of ether and
shake to ensure intimate mixing of the solution and the ether;
relive the pressure within the funnel by momentarily lifting the
stopper. (All flames in the vicinity must be extinguished during
the extraction ... :-) you must be joking ...). Allow the two
layers to separate; run off the lower aqueous layer into a beaker,
and pour the ethereal layer through the mounth of the funnel into a
200-mL flask. Return the aqueous solution to the funnel and extract
with a further 40 mL of ether. Proceed as before, and pour the
ethereal extract into the flask. Dry the combined ethereal
solutions with a few grams of anhydrous potassium carbonate (1):
shake the well-stoppered flask for several minutes. Filter the
ethereal solution through a fluted filter paper and remove the
ether by flash distillation, using a 50-ml round-bottomed flask to
which has been added a few boiling chips. Since ether is extremely
volatile and also highly flammable, the flask must be heated by
means of an electrically heated water bath. When all the ethereal
solution has been introduced into the flask, and no more ether
distilson the boiling water bath, run out the water from the
condenser, and distil the aniline either by direct heating over a
wire gauze or, preferably, using an air bath. A small quantity of
ether may pass over during the early part of the distillation; it
is therefore advisable to interpose a uralite board between the
receiver and the flame. Collect the fraction B.P. 180 - 184 &deg;C,
in a weighed conical flask. The yield of aniline is 18 g (97
%).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(1)</b> Calcium chloride cannot be used to dry the ethereal
solution because it combines with aniline (and other amines) to
form molecular compounds. The best drying agent is sodium or
potassium hydroxide (pellet form).</p>
