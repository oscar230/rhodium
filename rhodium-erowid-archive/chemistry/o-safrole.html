  <p>No direct synthesis of safrole has been recorded, the most recent attempt 
    being that of Baker and Robinson (<em>JCS, 1925, 127, 1424</em>), who distilled 
    the product of the action of silver oxide and water upon gamma-piperonylpropyltrimethylammonium 
    iodide, but obtained isosafrole, the double bond moving into the position 
    of greater stability. Kawai (<em>Sci. Papers Inst. Phys. Chem. Res., 1925, 
    3, 263</em>) has shown that the monoallyl ether of pyrocatechol undergoes 
    the Claisen rearrangement to give an oil which he considered to be a mixture 
    of 3- and 4-allyl-1,2-dihydroxybenzene.</p>

  <p>This matter has now been reinvestigated and, by repeated fractionation of 
    the product of the rearrangement, both of the above isomerides have been isolated 
    in a pure state as colourless, crystalline solids melting at 28°C and 48°C 
    respectively. As further confirmation of the course of the Claisen migration, 
    it has been found that the properties of the higher-melting isomeride (<strong>II</strong>) 
    are in accord with those assigned to the "4-allylbrenzcatechin" which Schimmel 
    and Co. (<em>Centr., 1907, II, 1741</em>) isolated in small quantity from 
    betel-leaf oil from Java. The second isomeride, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-allylbenzene 
    (<strong>I</strong>), has not previously been described.</p>

<p>In order to convert these substances into safrole (<strong>III</strong>) and o-safrole (<strong>IV</strong>), respectively, methylenation was carried out, with moderately good yields, by gently refluxing them with methylene iodide and anhydrous potassium carbonate in dry acetone solution. By employing such mild conditions, any change into the isomeric isosafroles during the course of the reaction was inhibited. The identity of the synthetic product with naturally occurring safrole has been established by preparing the pentabromo-derivative (mp 169°C) and the acetamido-derivative (mp 162-163°C) and comparing these with the same derivatives from natural safrole. The properties of the hitherto unknown isomeride o-safrole (<strong>IV</strong>)
(which resembles safrole in odour and in many other ways) have been recorded. The process of methylenation described above takes place very smoothly without formation of tarry products and may prove to be valuable in other cases of this kind.</p>

<h3>Experimental:</h3>

<h4>Mono- and Diallyl Ethers of Pyrocatechol</h4>

    <p>Pyrocatechol (132 g) and pure allyl bromide (144 g) were dissolved in pure 
      dry acetone (220ml), finely powdered, freshly heated potassium carbonate 
      (170 g) was added gradually with constant shaking, and the whole refluxed 
      for 6-8 hours on the water-bath, the condenser being fitted with a calcium 
      chloride tube (compare<em> Kawai, loc. cit.</em>). After removal of the 
      acetone, addition of water and dilute sulphuric acid, and extraction with 
      ether, the monoallyl ether and unchanged pyrocatechol were removed by washing 
      the extract with dilute, alkali solution, and the ethereal solution was 
      then dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated. The yield of pure 
      diallyl ether was 43 g (bp 124-125.5°C/13mmHg). The alkali washings were 
      immediately acidified and the oil was taken up in chloroform. After being 
      repeatedly washed with water to remove pyrocatechol, the chloroform was 
      evaporated and the oil distilled, yielding 90g of pure monoallyl ether, 
      bp 107.5-109°C/15mmHg. The yields of both ethers were considerably higher 
      than those recorded by Kawai under almost analogous conditions.</p>

<h4>Molecular rearrangement</h4>

<p>The monoallyl ether (92 g) was heated in a flask, fitted with a ground-in condenser, in a paraffin bath at 170-180°C, the inner temperature suddenly rose to 265°C with momentary boiling, the colour of the liquid changing to red. After cooling, the product was fractionated under 15-16 mmHg and fractions, bp 142-152°C (66.2g) and 152-160°C (17.2 g), were collected, leaving a resinous, non-volatile residue (9 g). The second fraction solidified on standing and consisted chiefly of 1,2-dihydroxy-4-allyl benzene, melting at 40-41°C with previous softening. Kawai noticed the formation of some crystals in his higher fraction (bp 155-160°C/16 mmHg) and suggested that they were due to pyrocatechol which had been set free during the rearrangement (compare Claisen, Annalen, 1913, 401, 21). In the present instance, however, no pyrocatechol was observed and it is probable that his crystals were those of 1,2-dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene.</p>

<p>After repeated systematic refractionation of the above two fractions, both isomerides were isolated in a pure condition, the proportion of 1,2-dihydroxy-3-allylbenzene to its isomeride in the rearranged product being approximately 5 to 4.
1,2-Dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene (<strong>II</strong>) is a colourless, waxy, crystalline solid soluble in water and most other solvents, but sparingly soluble in petroleum. It forms colourless needles, mp 48°C, from benzene-light petroleum and boils at 147-149°C/10mmHg and at 156-158°C/16mmHg.</p>

    <p>The dibenzoyl derivative (Schotten-Baumann) separates from light petroleum 
      in colourless prisms, mp 71°C. These properties clearly indicate that the 
      substance is identical with the "allylbrenzcatechin" isolated from Java 
      betel-leaf oil (<em>loc. cit.</em>). 1,2-Dihydroxy-3-allylbenzene (<strong>I</strong>) is 
      best purified by distillation under reduced pressure and has bp 143.5--145°C/15 
      mmHg. If allowed to crystallise slowly, it separates in large, colourless, 
      flat prisms, mp 28°C, but it has a tendency to remain liquid below this 
      temperature. Owing to this property, it was not found. possible to recrystallise 
      it satisfactorily. It dissolves readily in most solvents except petroleum, 
      whilst in water it is not as soluble as its isomeride.</p>

<p>It resembles its isomeride in having a phenolic odour and in aqueous solution it gives with ferric chloride an olive-green colour, changing to wine-red on addition of sodium carbonate.
The dibenzoyl derivative separates from light petroleum in colourless prisms, mp 60-61°C.</p>

<h4>Safrole (III)</h4>

    <p>1,2-Dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene (10 g) and methylene iodide (18 g) were dissolved 
      in pure dry acetone (35ml) and finely powdered, freshly ignited potassium. 
      carbonate (20g) was gradually added with shaking to prevent caking. After 
      gently refluxing on the water-bath for 12 hours, the acetone was removed, 
      the product was made acid with dilute sulphuric acid and extracted with 
      ether, and the ethereal solution was repeatedly washed with dilute aqueous 
      sodium hydroxide and finally with water, dried over sodium sulphate, and 
      evaporated. On carefully distilling the residue under reduced pressure, 
      methylene iodide first passed over; when this had been completely removed, 
      a fraction, bp 100-101.5°C/10-11mmHg, consisting of 2.5 g. of a clear, colourless 
      oil, was collected. This was identified as safrole by its characteristic 
      odour and by preparing its pentabromo- derivative by gradually adding excess 
      of bromine below 0°C and allowing the mixture to stand for some hours; the 
      solid substance which had separated, after recrystallising from ethyl alcohol, 
      melted at 169°C, and a mixed melting point with the derivative prepared 
      from ordinary safrole showed no depression. The oil had n<sub>D</sub><sup>20</sup> 1.5381. As 
      an additional proof of identity, 1.35 g of the synthetic substance were 
      nitrated under the conditions laid down by Foulds and Robinson (<em>JCS, 
      1914, 105, 1963</em>), the nitro-derivative was reduced with tin and hydrochloric 
      acid, and the crude 6-aminosafrole acetylated; the acetyl derivative crystallised 
      from methyl alcohol in colourless needles, mp 162-163°C, and a mixed melting-point 
      determination with the corresponding derivative from naturally occurring 
      safrole showed no depression.</p>

<h4>o-Safrole (IV)</h4>

<p>1,2-Dihydroxy-3-allylbenzene (20 g), methylene iodide (36 g), potassium carbonate (40 g), and acetone (70ml) were gently refluxed for 14 hours, and the product was treated in a manner similar to that described above in the synthesis of safrole. Methylene iodide was removed under reduced pressure, and the remainder (boiling over 1.5°C) collected separately. Yield 7g. It was redistilled and collected at 102.5-103°C/13mmHg. It boils at 106-107°C/16mmHg and at 226-227°C/762mmHg.</p>

<p>o-Safrole is a colourless, mobile oil which does not crystallise at -20°C and has n20D 1.5359. It has an agreeable odour, similar to, but not so pronounced as, that of safrole (compare the respective odours of o-piperonal and piperonal; <a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/ortho-piperonal.pdf">Perkin and Trikojus, JCS., 1926, 2927</a>). On the addition of excess of bromine to o-safrole cooled below 0°C, a vigorous reaction occurs ; the product, which solidifies on standing over-night, is washed with ethyl alcohol and crystallised from the same solvent, in which it is only sparingly soluble. The resulting pentabromo-derivative separates in colourless prisms, mp 154°C, and the yield is almost quantitative.</p>
