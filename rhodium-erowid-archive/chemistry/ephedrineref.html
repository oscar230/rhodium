        <h1>Extraction and Separation of Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine</h1>
        Manske &amp; Holmes, The Alkaloids, Vol III, p 343-344, Academic Press (1953)

      <p>The ephedrine bases may be extracted from the plant material, following
  general procedures. A method of extraction has been described by Chou
  (165): Powdered Ma Huang was extracted with cold benzene in the presence of
  diluted sodium carbonate. The benzene extract was extracted with dilute
  hydrochloric acid and the acid solution of the alkaloids clarified. After
  adding enough solid potassium carbonate to the acid solution, the alkaloids
  were extracted with chloroform. This solution was concentrated, dried over
  sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. Ephedrine has been separated
  from pseudo-ephedrine by means of the oxalate, the ephedrine salt being
  much less soluble in cold water.</p>

      <p>Feng and Read (104) found that the low yield of alkaloids obtained by
  previous workers was due to incomplete alkalinization of the herb before
  extraction with chloroform or ether. Hot extraction and the use of sodium
  hydrate to liberate the alkaloids has been found satisfactory. The ammonia-chloroform 
  process has been critically studied and it was found that a
  large excess of ammonia was necessary to liberate the alkaloids. Feng (103)
  extracted Ephedra equisetina, first with 80% alcohol and finally with 0.2%
  acetic acid. After working up the extracts, ephedrine was separated from
  pseudo-ephedrine by crystallization of the hydrochlorides from 95% alcohol.
  pseudo-Ephedrine may be recovered from the mother liquors. Ghose and
  Krishna (114, 117, 118) described other methods of extraction and the
  preparation of alkaloid concentrates. They separated ephedrine from
  pseudo-ephedrine by extracting the dry hydrochlorides with chloroform, in
  which only the pseudo-ephedrine salt is soluble.</p>

      <p>The separation of the six natural ephedra bases has been described by Kanao
  (150). l-Ephedrine was first separated as hydrochloride, then pseudoephedrine
  as the free base, l-methylephedrine as the oxalate, d-methyl-pseudoephedrine
  as the d-bitartrate and finally nor-d-pseudo-ephedrine, from alcohol, as
  the sulfate. Norephedrine, which crystallizes together with nor-d-pseudo-ephedrine 
was separated in the form of its l-bitartrate.</p>

        <h1>Physical Properties of Ephedrine (l-Ephedrine)</h1>
        Manske &amp; Holmes, The Alkaloids, Vol III, p 344-347, Academic Press (1953)
</center>
      <hr>

        
      <p>The free base (anhydrous) has mp 38.1&deg;C; the hemihydrate, mp 40&deg;C. With
  1.5% water, a eutectic mixture, ephedrine-ephedrine hydrate, with mp 32.1&deg;C,
  is obtained. The bp of anhydrous ephedrine is 225&deg;C (760 mmHg) and 152-153&deg;C
  (25 mmHg) (236-237). However, ephedrine is volatile even at room temperature;
  a sample exposed by Read to the air showed a loss of 33% after 4.5 months (107).
  It is rapidly volatile at 100&deg;C and therefore is volatile with steam (238).</p>

      <p>Ephedrine is soluble in water, alcohol, ether, chloroform, and oils (239).
  The solution in water is strongly alkaline to litmus paper. The hydrochloride,
  C10H15ON*HCl, is in the form of white, prismatic needles of bitter taste,
  mp 220-221&deg;C; soluble in 2 parts of water and in 15 parts of alcohol (95&deg;C).
  The hydrobromide has mp 205&deg;C. The hydrobromide and the hydrochloride,
  unlike the corresponding pseudo-ephedrine salts, are very sparingly soluble
  in chloroform (30). The hydriodide, from acetone, has mp 165&deg;C (43). The
  sulfate is in the form of hexagonal plates, mp 247&deg;C, soluble in four parts
  of water, sparingly soluble in alcohol. </p>

      <p>Ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine are quite stable compounds. Heating at 100&deg;C
  for 24 hours causes no decomposition (42, 28). No alteration is observed by
  heating the bases with 5% sodium hydroxide on the water bath (21).
  Unsuccessful attempts were made to racemize ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine
  with barium hydroxide or alcoholic potassium hydroxide (25). However, in
  the patent literature statements have been made that the optically active
  forms of the bases can be racemized by heating them with alkali
  alcoholates, at temperatures ranging from 168-195&deg;C, in the molten state,
  or in a solvent (274, 275). Ephedrine solutions are unstable in sunlight in
  the presence of oxygen (276).</p>

      <p>On heating ephedrine hydrochloride with 5% hydrochloric acid, under
  pressure, at 170-180&deg;C (248) or with 25% acid, at 100&deg;C, the compound is
  partially converted to pseudo-ephedrine (20, 32, 40). The conversion is
  reversible and an equilibrium is established. According to Emde (39), the
  rearrangement takes place by replacement of the hydroxyl group by chlorine,
  followed by hydrolysis. Oxidation of ephedrine or pseudo-ephedrine, gives
  benzaldehyde or benzoic acid.</p>

      <p>By the reduction of ephedrine or pseudo-ephedrine, the same deoxyephedrine
  (methamphetamine, C10H15N), is obtained (29, 39). Hydrochloride has mp 172&deg;C.</p>
      <p>A peculiar property of ephedrine is its rather violent reaction with
  chloroform; by evaporation of a solution of ephedrine in this solvent,
  ephedrine hydrochloride and aldehydes are formed. Chloroform thus can not
  be considered a suitable medium for the extraction and the estimation of
  ephedrine (245, 246).</p>

      <p>d-Ephedrine has not been found naturally. The synthetic base has mp 40-40.5&deg;C;
  the hydrochloride is in the form of white leaflets, mp 216-217&deg;C.
      <p>dl-Ephedrine (racemic ephedrine), is the synthetic, inactive ephedrine of
  commerce. The free base has mp 76-78&deg;C; hydrochloride, mp 187-188&deg;C.</p>

        <h1>Synthesis of the Ephedra Bases</h1>
        Manske &amp; Holmes, The Alkaloids, Vol III, p 351-361, Academic Press (1953)
</center>
      <hr>

        
      <p>The first attempts to synthesize ephedrine were by Fourneau (47, 48) in
  1904, followed by Schmidt (19, 22, 24, 25) in 1905. Nagai (14) in 1911
  achieved a synthesis of racemic ephedrine, but the fact has not been duly
  credited in the literature. Eberhard (65, 66, 67) obtained racemic ephedrine
  and pseudoephedrine in 1917 by hydrogenation of alpha-methylaminopropiophenone.
  In 1920, Sp&auml;th and G&ouml;hring (68, 69) synthesized ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
  their optical antipodes, and racemic compounds. Propionaldehyde was first
  brominated and the monobromo-derivative reacted with methanol and hydrobromic
  acid yielding 1,2-dibromo-1-methoxypropane, which in turn with phenylmagnesium-bromide 
gave an addition product which after hydrolysis yielded 1-phenyl-1-methoxy-2-bromopropane. 
This was converted by methylamine into 1-phenyl-<br>
  1-methoxy-2-methylaminopropane, which on hydrolysis with hydrobromic acid,
  yielded 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy-2-methylaminopropane, i.e. racemic pseudoephedrine.</p>

      <p>The racemic base was resolved, by crystallization of the tartrates, into
  l- and d-pseudoephedrine. By isomerization of both forms, with hydrochloric
  acid, l- and d-ephedrine were obtained.</p>

      <p>Fourneau and Puyal (49) prepared methylstyrene by dehydration of phenylethyl-carbinol. 
The corresponding bromohydrin was reacted with methylamine; several
  isomeric ephedrines were obtained. The compound of mp 60&deg;C was shown later
  by Fourneau and Kanao (50) to be isoephedrine, corresponding to structure
  1-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropan-2-ol of Emde (51).</p>

      <p>In 1925 Sp&auml;th and Koller described a new ephedrine synthesis. Alpha-Phenyl-propylene 
was reacted with bromine to 1-phenyl-1,2-dibromopropane. One
  bromine was then substituted by methoxyl, the other by NHCH3. On hydrolysis
  with fuming hydrobromic acid, racemic pseudoephedrine was formed. (Compare
  also Sp&auml;th and Bretschneider, (261).</p>

      <p>Kanao (71), in 1927, synthesized racemic ephedrine in excellent yields by
  methylating phenylpropanolamine or by reducing alpha-methylaminopropiophenone.
  The first compound had been prepared by condensation of benzaldehyde with
  nitroethane followed by reduction. Two amines were obtained, which by
  methylation gave racemic ephedrine and racemic pseudoephedrine respectively.
  Nagai and Kanao (17) described the syntheses of the optically active
  ephedrines and those of the nor- and N-methylephedrines and pseudoephedrines,
  following this method of preparation. Later, in 1947, Hoover and Hass (270)
  utilized the same reaction sequence to obtain the ephedrine bases.</p>

      <p>The ephedrine synthesis described by Manske and Johnson (74) and by Skita
  and Keil (77) in 1929 is founded on a different reaction. If a mixture of
  alpha-phenylpropane-alpha,beta-dione and methylamine, in absolute alcohol
  is hydrogenated catalytically in the presence of platinum oxide (Manske) or
  colloidal platinum (Skita), dl-ephedrine, with a little dl-pseudoephedrine
  is obtained. The reaction has been further elaborated by Coles, Manske, and
  Johnson (76), by Skita, Keil and coworkers (78, 79, 262, 263) and by<br>
  Couturier (265). Manske and Johnson (75) synthesized some ephedrine homologs
  and resolved racemic ephedrine by means of d- and l-mandelic acid. The pure
  l form of this acid is prepared easily with the aid of natural ephedrine,
  as confirmed by Jarowski and Hartung (268).</p>

      <p>Freudenberg, Shoeffel, and Braun (59, 60), started from d(-) mandelic acid.
  The amide, with methylmagnesium iodide, gives l-phenylacetylcarbinol,
  which, by catalytic hydrogenation, in the presence of methylamine, yields
  l- ephedrine. Bossert and Brode (264) synthesized l-ephedrine by reacting
  1-phenyl-1-ethoxy-2-bromopropane with methylamine, followed by hydrolysis.
  Sah (80) in 1938 reported a general method for the conversion of aminoacids
  into alkaloids of the ephedrine type. Benzylchlorocarbonate was condensed
  with alanine and the product transformed into the acid chloride. This
  substance, with phenylmagnesiumbromide, yielded a compound, which on
  catalytic hydrogenation with palladium and decomposition in toluene generated
  carbon dioxide and a mixture of racemic norephedrine and nor-pseudoephedrine.
  Stevens and coworker (266, 267) studied the reduction of alpha-bromopropiophenone 
with aluminum isopropylate. A bromohydrin was obtained, which with
  methylamine gave a small yield of dl-pseudoephedrine.</p>

      <p>Fourneau and Benoit (55) investigated the action of methylamine on several
  forms of phenylpropylene oxide. A complicated mixture of ephedrines and<br>
  isoephedrines was obtained.</p>

      <p>According to Akabori and Momotani (269), a mixture of an aromatic aldehyde
  and an amino acid on heating yield alkamines. By means of this reaction,
  ephedrine and norephedrine were synthesized.</p>

      <p>A very ingenious direct synthesis of l-ephedrine, avoiding the laborious
  resolution of the racemic mixture, has been devised by Hildebrandt and
  Klavehn (271) and described by Hamlet (272). Neuberg and Hirsch (273) in
  1921 demonstrated that when equal mole of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are
  added to a carbohydrate solution actively fermenting by yeast, levorotatory
  1-phenyl-2-ketopropan-1-ol, is formed. This compound on reaction with
  methylamine and catalytic reduction yields l-ephedrine directly.</p>

      <p>Racemic ephedrine can be separated by chromatography into the optically
  active forms, according to Lecoq (226). Syntheses of homologs and isomers
  of ephedrine have been described by Schmidt and Calliess (25), Hyde, Browning,
  and Adams (281), Sanchez (282), Manske and Johnson (75), Fourneau and Barrelet
  (53), Fourneau, Benoit and Firmenich (54), Fr&eacute;on and Ser (283), Kanao (278),
  Beals and Gilfillan (279), Wilson and Chang (280), Lozeron (284), Mannich
  and Budde (285), and Lambillon (286). Skita, Ceil, and Meiner (79), prepared
  the nucleus-hydrogenated optically active hexahydroephedrines, by resolution
  of the racemic compounds with optically-active mandelic acids.</p>
