          <p>Oil of massoira bark (?) reputedly yields about 14% safrole.</p>

          <hr>
          <h2>A major source: CAMPHOR LAUREL ROOT : Cinnamomum Camphora</h2>
          <p>C. camphora is a pest xenophyte tree species now at plague proportions
            in regions such as northern NSW. They exude chemicals via their roots,
            into the soil, which kills worms and other soil biota; via their leaves
            which kill aquatic organisms near leaf-drop regions, and their berries
            sterilise the birds which eat them. They can live for over 1200 years.
            The canonical work on camphor and safrole production from this tree
            was performed by Dr Teikichi Hiraizumi, President of Takasago Chem
            Industry Co, Tokyo, and can be found in the essential oils work by
            Guenther. </p>
          <p>CAMPHOR OIL is obtained by steam distillation of the wood of the
            camphor tree Cinnamonum camphora Sieb. (Lauraceae) growing in China,
            Taiwan, Japan [and Australia, where it is classed as a noxious weed].
            The main constituent of the crude oil is camphor (ca. 50%) which can
            be separated by cooling and centrifugation.</p>
          <p>Fractionation of the mother liquor gives two oils:<br>
            <b>1)</b> White camphor oil is the first distillation fraction (ca
            20% of the crude camphor oil). It is a colourless or nearly colourless
            liquid with a cineole-like odour.</p>
          <p><b>2)</b> Brown Oil of camphor is a fraction with a boiling point
            higher than that of camphor (ca. 20%) It is a pale yellow to brown
            liquid with the odour of sassafras oil.</p>
          <p> Density 1.064-1.075; Optical rotation [ND20] 1.51 - 1.55 [alpha]d
            0 to +3? Flash point 6�C. Solubility 1 vol in 2 vols of 90% ethanol.</p>
          <p> The oil contains more than 80% safrole and, like Brazilian sassafras
            oil, is therefore used as raw material for the production of piperonal
            via isosafrole. Camphor oils with a high safrole content can also
            be obtained by steam distillation of the wood of Cinnamonum parthenoxylon
            Nees.</p>
          <p>Three Varieties of camphor oils are produced.</p>

          <p>Along with the crude oil comes a solid, partly crystalline mass of
            crude camphor. The oil is separated from the crude camphor by filterpressing.
            This yields crude camphor oil. The crude oil is subsequently fractionally
            distilled under vacuum, and yeilds another 50% of crude camphor. The

            light terpenes, cineole, safrole, terpineol, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpene
            alcohols. These are separated into various fractions known as:</p>

            Brown oil of camphor is the medium heavy fraction from vacuum distillation
            of the camphor-free oil (aka white oil, filterpressed and camphor-free).
            Brown camphor oil amounts to 6 or 7 percent of the total oil, or 20-22%
            of the decamphorised oil. Brown oil is produced almost entirely in
            Formosa and Japan, from the Hon-Sho type of cinnamomum camphora, the
            camphor tree.</p>
          <p> This fraction is most interesting from the perfumer's point of view.
            Its main constituent is safrole, and the redistilled brown camphor
            can be used directly in soaps for its magnificent masking effect.
            The safrole can be isolated from the oil and used as a starting material
            for heliotropine, vanillin and other perfume materials. Terpineol
            is also separated during the safrole-isolation and serves as is or
            may be transformed into terpinyl esters.</p>
          <p> An artificial sassafras oil, &quot;Oil Camphor Sassafrassy&quot;
            is also produced from the brown oil by rectification and adjustment
            of the content of safrole, terpenes, etc.</p>

          <p>Abstract: The root bark of Sassafras albidum (Nuttall) Nees Lauraceae)
            was extracted at room temperature with hexane and chloroform as solvents.
            The isolated essential oils were analyzed with GC and GC/MS. Thirty
            compounds were identified, nine of which have not been previously
            reported from this species. The major compounds were safrole (85%),
            camphor (3.25%), and methyleugenol (1.10%). Ten sesquiterpenes were
            also identified.</p>

            <b>Species:</b> Cinnamomum oliveri<br>
            <b>Family:</b> Lauraceae<br>
            <b>Synonyms:</b> none<br>
            <b>Vernacular names:</b> Sassafras (Oliver's, camphorwood).<br>
            <b>Appearance:</b> A tall tree up to 45m high, with a brown, nodular
            bark, very fragrant when cut. Its opposite leaves are narrow and tapered
            at both ends, glossy above and much paler below, 20cm long and 3.5cm
            broad. Velvety, cream coloured flowers occur in bunches 15-20cm long
            in upper leaf forks or at then end of branchlets. Fruits are oval
            berries, 12mm long, containing a single seed, sometimes irregular
            in shape owing to numerous galls. Flowers in late spring to early
            summer. The similar Beilschmiedia obtusifolata has much broader leaves.<br>
            <b>Habitat:</b> In the rainforests of northern NSW and southern Queensland.<br>
            <b> Active con:</b> The bark contains an essential oil rich in safrole,
            plus several alkaloids along with camphor, methyleugenol, or eugenol
            depending on the species. It is not certain that the Australian authorities
            would go on an enviropogrom in order to destroy these plants. They
            have attempted to suppress marijuana with only limited success. It
            is unlikely therefore that they can successfully suppress sassafras
            trees. Incidentally, yes you can find large stands of sassafras trees
            near a town called Sassafras, NSW.<br>

          <h2>Smell</h2>
          <p>Safrole's smell has been variously described in terms of other molecules.
            Safrole probably interacts with the same olfactory G-coupled receptors
            as the volatiles in the anise plant, and this makes sense insofar
            as some of the components in the oil of anise are structurally similar [but not the same as -- Erowid]
            to safrole. It is accurately described as a candy-shop odour. Go into
            a place which sells more sugary things than chocolatey things and
            take a deep whiff. It is also reminiscent of ginger. It has been described
            as smelling like MDMA, anise, rootbeer, sassafras oil, MDA, mCPP or
            sodium lactate. Halo-derivatives of<br>
            safrole are said to have similar smells to the parent molecule. Safrole
            is conspicuously absent from the Sigma-Aldrich Flavours and Fragrances
            catalog. Some useful derivatives of safrole (piperonal &quot;sweet,
            floral&quot;, piperonyl acetate, &quot;cherry, strawberry&quot;, piperonyl
            acetone and piperonyl isobutyrate &quot;fruity, berry&quot;) are present,
            however.</p>

        <p align="justify">LD50 in rats is 2.35g/kg. It is mainly metabolised
          by the cytochromes P450. Neither sassafras nor the oil should be taken
          internally. The use of herb teas of sassafras may lead to a large dose
          of safrole. The use of safrole in foods has been banned because of carcinogenic
          and hepatotoxic risks. The use of safrole in toilet preparations is
          also controlled. A 47 year old woman experienced 'shakiness', vomiting,
          anxiety, tachycardia and raised blood pressure following ingestion of
          a potentially fatal dose of sassafras oil (5mL). Treatment was symptomatic
          following the use of activated charcoal.<br>
          <strong>See:</strong> Grande GA, Dannewitz SR,<br>
          Symptomatic Sassafras Oil Ingestion,<br>
          Vet. Hum. Toxicol 1987 29 447<br>
          Recognized Carcinogen P65, Suspected Gastrointestinal or Liver Toxicant,
          Kidney Toxicant, Neurotoxicant, Reproductive Toxicant. More hazardous
          than most chemicals in 6 out of 7 ranking systems. At least 8 covalent
          adducts are formed when calf thymus DNA is incubated with safrole-2',3'-oxide,an
          oxygenated metabolite of safrole in vitro. However, no corresponding
          adducts are formed with liver DNA when whole animals are exposed to
          safrole 2',3'-oxide, or safrole itself. Although safrole 2',3'-oxide
          is readily formed in vivo, and is sufficiently reactive to covalently
          bind to DNA, it is probably not a factor in the in vivo genotoxicity
          of safrole. Tox. Letters. 75(1-3):201-207, 1995 Jan. ISSN 0378-4274</p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p align="left">Safrole was used for decades in perfumes and medicines
          until in the 1960's. Its primary industrial application was conversion
          to isosafrole, a precursor to a dye called heliotropin and vanillin,
          a flavour molecule. In the 1990s it was listed, along with isosafrole,
          on the prohibited import regulations list, due to its application as
          a precursor in the synthesis of banned psychoactive methamphetamines.
          It is still used in the preparation of the following pharmaceutical
          products:<br>
          Humexinal, Inhalador Vicks, Linimento Klari, Linimento Walderr, Zam-Buk
          and Vegebom du Dr Miot, though in small quantities. Piperonyl butoxide,
          which is used as a synergist in aerosol pesticides, is probably synthesised
          from a safrole-derived feedstock.<br>
        </p>
        <hr> <h1 align="left">3) Safrole extraction and refinement <a name="extraction"></a></h1>
        <h3>Isolating Methods</h3>
        <p>Soxhletting the root bark of cinnamomum camphora (camphor laurel),
          or probably parts of other plants (see below) with distilled ethanol,
          or hexane and chloroform, yields most of the available safrole, and
          is cheap and effective. The solvents can be evaporated off or reclaimed
          by distillation.<br>
          Dealing with the impurities in the soxhlet extract is another matter.
          Steam distillation from bulk plant material is also reported to work.</p>
        <h3>Refinement methods from oil</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Cool the oil or the safrole-containing fraction of the oil, to
            at least -12�C. Safrole will crystallise.</li>
          <li>Use fractional distillation, followed by cooling and crystallisation.
            Regarding the distillation of safrole in mixtures consult Brauer,
            Ber Schimmel &amp; Co, Jubil?ms-Ausgabe (1929), 153.</li>
          <li> Where safrole may be contaminated by oily constituents in an essential
            oil as in red camphor oil, the method of Ikeda and Takeda (a) may
            be employed advantageously to determine the safrole by reparation
            of the addition product with mercuric acetate and sodium chloride
            in dilute acetone. The precipitate so formed should be filtered in
            a Gooch funnel and weighed, and used with a correction factor to define
            the percentage of safrole in the sample. This complex hydroxychloride
            of safrole [C10H10O2(OH)HgCl] according to Tsukamoto (b) is readily
            decomposed to regenerate safrole either by sodium sulfide and zinc
            in potassium hydroxide; or hydrochloric acid. The oxychloride melts
            at 141-142�C according to Fujita (c).</li>

        <p align="left">Safrole will convert to allylpyrocatechol when heated
          with phosphoric acid. Safrole is oxidised to piperonylic acid (mp 238�C)
          by the action of potassium permanganate in aqueous acetone. Some piperonylacetic
          acid (mp 87-88�C) is also produced. Safrole is oxidised to piperonal
          (heliotropin, mp 38�C) by the action of potassium dichromate and dilute
          sulfuric acid. Safrole isomerises to isosafrole when heated with alkalis.
          See also step (3) in isolation, above.</p>
        <h2>Isosafrole (120-58-1)</h2>
        <p align="left"> Isosafrole is technically a member of the styrenes and
          polymerises under the influence of acids. It is soluble in ethanol,
          ether, benzene and is steam-volatile. It shares safrole's empirical
          formula and molecular weight. Isosafrole exists in two isomeric forms,
          the cis- isomer and the more energetically favourable trans-isomer.
          Warming converts the cis-form to the trans-configuration. Isosafrole
          is not as widely distributed in nature as safrole. It is best purified
          via a picrate derivative, the trans- isomer of which has mp 74.75�C.
          The picrate cis- isomer melts at 68.5�C.<br>
          Cis-isosafrole boils at 253�C at 760mmHg; 179.5�C at 100mmHg.<br>
          Trans-isosafrole melts at 6.7-6.8�C and boils at 247-247�C.<br>
          Trans-isosafrole has a density of 1.122g/cc.</p>

        <h3><em><strong>(Addition by &quot;Indole&quot;):</strong></em></h3>
        <p>Chenopodium ambrosioides var. anthelminticum (Wormseed) (flowering
          plant, % unknown)<br>
          (this one is an oil that is restricted in most countries, apparantly
          due to it's high ascaridole (up to 80%) content)<br>
          <em>Note by MescalToad:</em> ascaridole is an unstable (even explosive)
          peroxide.</p>
        <p>These are additions to the species already mentioned:</p>
        <p>Cananga odorata (add. var. macrophylla, other variety doesn't seem
          to have safrole/isosafrole), also Cananga odorata appears to have safrole,
          never seen info saying it had isosafrole...</p>
        <p>Myristica fragrans (volatile seed oil, 0.2-0.6 (my ref has reports
          up to 2%)<br>
          Myristica fragrans add:(husk oil, &gt;1%)</p>
        <p>Also, you could probably change Illicium verum from (Star Anise...
          disputed) to (fruit, unknown) or (fruit, low%) as the same ref. I keep
          mentioning has info on this one...although it is low... <a href="safrolefaq.html#illicium-verum">DISPUTED</a></p>
        <p>here's the ref if you need it:<br>

        <h3><em>Anonymous:</em></h3>
        <p>Just thought you might like to add some info onto your safrole FAQ
          sheet on your site. The Australian botanicals, southern sassafras and
          ziera smiithi have no safrole in their roots, bark, trunks or foliage.
          Southern sass has nothing worth mentioning whilst smiithi contains lots
          of methyl eugenol, which is where the confusion started I believe, the
          text 'poisionous plants of Australia' is fraught with errors and as
          much of the info in the current Safrole FAQ is lifted directly from
          this hence the errors. This will save readers much time I believe as
          I have wasted heaps of time collecting , seperating and steam distilling
          all the bits. The methyl eugenol's existence was confirmed through FTIR
          and NMR library matches so there is no doubt to the accuracy of this
          info. The only assumption I am making is that maybe safrole only seasonally
          appears in these species, as my samples were all collected in winter/spring.</p>

<b>Notes:</b><br>
<p><a name="illicium-verum">Illicium verum - Star Anise - Note</a> : RA points out
that research has shown star anise contains no or very low levels of safrole and high levels of anethole,
a structurally similar oil. If synthetic techniques designed for safrole are used on anethole, dangerously
different final chemicals can result, such as PMA instead of MDMA. (Added by Erowid July 2007)</p>
