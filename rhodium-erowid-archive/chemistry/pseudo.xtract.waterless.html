</ol>

<p>
<b>Standard Procedure:</b>
</p>

<p>
1)If using 30 mg pills with red coating, remove the red coating.  Grind
pills to powder form.  Use a morter and pestle after coffee grinder;
texture should be a fine powder and few coffee grinders get the pills
fine enough by themselves.
</p>

<p>
2) The powdered pill mass should first be soaked in a non-polar
solvent.  Choice of solvent is dictated by the presence of povidone
and/or polyethylene glycol.  If povidone is present, mineral turpentine
is the solvent of choice; alternatives include xylene, tolulene,
mineral spirits. Suggested time: twelve hours. If povidone
is not present but polyethylene glycol is present, soak in non-polar
solvent for at least six hours.  Recommended solvent: xylene, tolulene,
mineral spirits. Decant non-polar solvent.
</p>

<p>
3) Rinse pill mass with dried acetone, discard acetone.  If the pills
contain an antihistamine, place pill mass in pyex dish, cover with two
to three times its volume in dried acetone, bring temperature up
slowly with hotplate to a steady gentle boil with constant
ventilation.  No open flame or ignition source may be used.  Stir
boiling acetone continuously for five minutes, remove from heat,
decant acetone.  Spread pill mass and allow to dry to complete dryness.
</p>

<p>
4) Weigh out one gram of NaOH for each gram of available
pseudoephedrine in the pill mass.  Weigh out one gram of NaCl for each
gram of available pseudoephedrine (rock salt is recommended).  Combine
and grind in coffee grinder to fine powder.  Take care to avoid
inhalation of powdered NaOH! Mix the combined salt and sodium
hydroxide with the dry pill mass and stir with a glass rod until the
mixture is evenly and thoroughly mixed.
</p>

<p>
5)With the pill mass/ sodium hydroxide/ salt mixture in a pyrex beaker
of sufficient depth to allow the addition of three times the pill mass
volume of non-polar solvent, add very dry isopropyl alcohol in small
quantities while mixing the mass with a glass rod; continue adding
alcohol and stirring until the pill mass has the consistency of a thin
paste.  The pill mass should heat slowly during this step.  At no time
should the mass become too hot to hold comfortably.  If the heat
rises  quickly and beyond comfortable temperature to hold, add
non-polar solvent immediately.  As long as the temperature does not
make a quick surge, work the pill mass for at least ten minutes to
insure all portions of the pill mass have been exposed to the base.
You will observe the color change of the pill mass, most usually to a
medium yellow or light tan/brown shade.  This is expected.  Dark brown
indicates the presence of excess water but will not impede the
process.
</p>

<p>
6) Add three times the volume of the pill mass with non-polar solvent.
Xylene is recommended.  Mix this with the paste very thoroughly,
recommended for at least fifteen minutes.  Allow to settle, decant the
non-polar solvent.  Repeat this step twice.  The amount of mixing and
the time period may be shortened for the last two non-polar soaks.
Combine the three volumes of non-polar solvent used to extract the
freebase pseudoephedrine.
</p>

<p>
7) Wash the non-polar solvent with warm distilled water wash, cool
distilled water wash, and a third warm water wash.  Continue washing
until the washes are clean.  After the third wash, monitor the pH and
do not allow it to fall below pH 9.  If necessary to remove excess
sodium ions, do a NaOH wash of the nonpolar with a 20% NaOH
solution.
</p>

<p>
8) Extract the pseudoephedrine from the non-polar solvent by gassing
or by aqueous HCl addition and evaporation to near dryness, followed
with an acetone "flash."
</p>

<p>
9) Rinse the collected pseudoephedrine in dry acetone.  Dissolve
in hot dry isopropyl alcohol and recrystalize with dry acetone as a
second solvent.  Repeat the recrystalization.

</p>

<p>
<b>Notes and comments:</b>
</p>

<p>
1) Pill selection: this process was developed with generic
antihistamine tablets with 60 mg pseudoephedrine and 2.5 mg
tripolidine.  It also is effective with pseudoephedrine sulphate
antihistamine tablets with cloropheneramine maleate, and changes the
form to the salt form for the reaction.  Name brand and generic 120 mg
and 240 mg time release pseudoephedrine tablets may be extracted with
the process.  Yields for the above average 60- 66 percent of available
pseudoephedrine hydrochloride by weight.  Extraction process yields
very clean pseudoephedrine HCl.  If the pills are dry matrix
formulation such as the time release 120 mg caplets, it is very
important that every solvent used be as dry as possible and that the
pill mass not be exposed to excess moisture or allowed to remain
exposed and uncovered.
</p>

<p>
2) The presoak in non-polar solvent is to remove povidone and mineral
turpentine is recommended.  Alternatives are soaks in xylene, tolulene,
mineral spirits.  Minimum twelve hour soak for any solvent but mineral
turpentine.  If povidone is not listed and you are familiar with the
pills and have not encountered povidone in them even though unlisted,
a soak in any of the other suggested non-polar solvents is done to
remove polyethylene glycol.  Six hours is sufficient; shorter times may
be effective but have not been tested by the author.  PEG should be
soluble in any of the nonpolar solvents, but if the pills are the 120
time release formulation (or the "dry matrix" formulation) the author
strongly suggests xylene be used.
</p>

<p>
3) The acetone rinse is to rid the pill mass of the non-polar
solvent. The following acetone boil is to remove tripolidine or
chloropheneramine maleate.  If there are no antihistamines present in
the formula, the acetone boil is unnecessary and should not be done.
Do not boil the pill mass with the solvent, or with the solvent and
acetone combined.  Rinse the solvent and then use fresh acetone to
boil.  Yield seems to be better is the entire pill mass is allowed to
dry thoroughly before the addition of base.  Drying in the microwave on
less than full power is effective, although not particularly
recommended.  Drying in an electric oven at low temperature, not to
exceed 150 degrees F if also effective to dry the pill mass.
</p>

<p>
4) If the pill mass is in the least clumpy or hard, grind it to powder
again before proceeding.  NaOH may be used to base.  Gram per gram is
probably an excess of NaOH, but it does effect the basing.  Sodium
carbonate has been used with good success and it provides fewer
contaminants to the non-polar solvent that need to be washed out.
Baking soda baked completely dry-- 350 degrees for thirty minutes in a
shallow dish should be sufficient, yields sodium carbonate. pH Down at
the pool store is sodium carbonate and may also be used for the
process.  Salt is recommended as an addition to the lye as it provides
a moisture absorbing substance to help prevent the lye from absorbing
moisture immediately on powdering.  Lye can be used without grinding
it; powdered NaOH seems to give better performance.
</p>

<p>
5) The selection of solvents to mobilize the HCl is one of choice.  On
the antihistamine type pills, MeOH may be used, but is not
recommended.  Very dry ISO alcohol is one recommendation, although dry
acetone seems to work very well.  If the pills are time release or dry
matrix formulation, dryness is essential to yield.  Dry acetone is
highly recommended.  The addition of the solvent should be a little at
a time, working the pill mass until a slightly thin paste is achieved.
Water, including moisture in alcohol or acetone, will tend to speed
the basing process up and if NaOH is used it can become hot too
quickly and damage the pseudoephedrine.  Care should be taken to select
dry solvents.  Working the mass thoroughly is thought to be important
to yield.  Too much alcohol can impede the a/b process, and the amount
used should be carefully tailored to avoid making the pill mass runny
and diluting the non-polar solvent with alcohol.
</p>

<p>
6) Xylene is the author's preferred non-polar solvent for extracting
the freebase pseudoephedrine as it is unlikely to contain any
significant amount of water straight from the can, or even after
having been used.  It is considered to be the solvent of choice for dry
matrix formulations.  Tolulene and Mineral Spirits have been used with
equivalent success.  Naptha is not a recommended solvent for this
purpose.
</p>

<p>
7) The washes will rid the non-polar solvent of any color they aquire
from the pill mass and excess sodium ions.  Wash until clean.  Save the
water washes to check for pseudo freebase that may hitch a ride in the
water.  It can happen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advantages:</b> works with most pills; safer than solvent boiling
techniques; fewer solvents used; less odor; pseudoephedrine HCl
obtained is very clean and has fewer impurities that affect the
reaction, contaminate the red phosphorous, or contribute to yield
loss.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disadvantages:</b> complex for those unfamiliar with a/b process;
risk of damage to the pseudoephedrine during the basing process; low
yields if done improperly or too much alcohol used; may allow
polyethylene glycol or povidone to be extracted with the
pseudoephedrine if proper soaking is not done; some report limited
yields with the process.
