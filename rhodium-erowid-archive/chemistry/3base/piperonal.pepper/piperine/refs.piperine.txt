NEW AMIDES  FROM PIPERINE -  A NATURAL ALKALOID WITH POTENTIAL INSECTICIDAL AND OTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. 
  

           The insecticidal properties of black pepper extracts were discovered as early as 1924. Piperine is the major constituent found in Piper nigrum and it was
found to be toxic to domestic fly. The potential of this class of compounds as a model for the development of pesticides has been investigated by several
researchers. 

         Several new amides were described from piperic acid (obtained by hydrolysis of piperine).  [ Synthesis and insecticidal activity of new amide derivatives of
piperine.  Vanderlu?cia F de paula et al, Pest Manag. Sci., 56, 768-174,2000]. 

         synthesis of a number of amide with piperic acid using heterocyclic amines. Such as amino derivatives of   flavones, coumarins and several other nitrogen
heterocyclics will be rewarding.These heterocyclics are known to  elaborate insecticidal activity. These compounds may exhibit wide range of other pharmacological
activities also. 
    Piperine was also isolated from Piper longum .

Knowledge of indigenous  people (tribals) is essentials for  chemists.Digitoxin (from  Digitalis species, quinine (from Cinchona species),Cocaine  (from
Erythroxylum species),Atropa (Atropa belladona) ,Asprin (Salix species), and Reserpin (Rauwolfia serpentina) were only  few examples where indigenous
people contributed to modern medicine.

A Supercrit. Fluid Extn. (SFE) method was developed for the extn. of effective components in 
Piper longum L. The optimal extn. conditions of SFE were designed. The comparison was 
conducted between SFE and traditional org. extn. The optimal SFE conditions were that: (1) 
alc. was used as a modifier of supercrit. fluid CO2 and (2) the sample was extd. by this 
supercrit. fluid in statics for 15 min and then 5 mL dynamically at 40 and 2. 068 X 107 
Pa(3000Psi). The method was simple, rapid, perfect, and its extn. rate was higher than that 
by org. solvent extn.

  A process for preparing piperine includes immersing extraction of pepper is mixed organic 
solvent, distilling to separate out organic solvent to obtain liquid

  mixture of pepper oil resin and piperine, cooling to separate out the pepper oil resin, 
and further purifying. Its advantages are simple process, high extraction rate

  and separation effect, and high purity.
