<p>&quot;A neutral principle obtained from pepper, and obtainable
also from other plants of the natural order <i>Piperaceae</i>&quot;&#151;U.S.
P.).</p>

<p><b>Source, History, and Preparation.</b>&#151;Piperin, the
active principle of pepper (see <a href="../pepper/kad.piper.html"><i>Piper</i></a>),
exists in the black, white and long pepper, and in the berries of
<i>Cubeba Clusii</i>, Miquel. It was first obtained by Oersted,
of Copenhagen, in 1819, who believed it to be an organic base.
Pelletier (1821) proved, however, that it is a non-basic
principle. It may be isolated by various methods. According to
Cazeneuve and Caillol (<i>Jahresb. der Pharm.</i>, 1877, p. 68),
powdered pepper is mixed with milk of lime, the mixture
evaporated to dryness on the water-bath, and extracted with ether.
This solvent upon evaporation leaves piperin in the form of
impure crystals, which are purified best by crystallization from
acetone (Flückiger, 1891).Sumatra pepper yielded Cazeneuve, on
an average, 8.10 per cent; Singapore white pepper, 9.15 per cent
of piperin. T. Stevenson (see <i>Amer. Jour. Pharm.</i>, 1885, p.
513) prepares an extract from 50 grammes of pepper with methyl
alcohol, dissolves out the resinous portion by means of potassium
carbonate; the residual piperin is washed with water and
recrystallized from alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Description and Chemical Composition.</b>&#151;<i>Piperin </i>(C<font size="1">17</font>H<font size="1">19</font>NO<font size="1">3</font>)
is described by the U. S. P. as forming &quot;colorless or pale
yellowish, shining, prismatic crystals, odorless, and almost
tasteless when first put in the mouth, but on prolonged contact
producing a sharp and biting sensation. Permanent in the air.
Almost insoluble in water; soluble in 30 parts of alcohol at 15°
C. (59° F.), and in 1 part of boiling alcohol; very soluble in
hot acetic acid; only slightly soluble in ether. When heated to
130° C. (266° F.) piperin melts; upon ignition it emits
alkaline vapors, and is consumed, leaving no residue. The
alcoholic solution of piperin is neutral to litmus paper.
Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves piperin with a dark blood-red
color, which disappears on dilution with water. When treated with
nitric acid, piperin turns rapidly first orange and then red, and
the acid acquires a yellow color, deepening to reddish as the
crystals dissolve. On adding to this solution an excess of
potassium hydrate T.S., the color is at first yellow, but upon
boiling it becomes blood-red&quot;&#151;(U. S. P.). Piperin is
also soluble in chloroform, benzol, carbon disulphide, but almost
insoluble in petroleum ether. Piperin has only weak basic
properties, being hardly soluble in dilute acids. With
hydrochloric acid and platinic chloride, however, it forms a well
crystallizable double salt. Piperin is not decomposable even by
boiling solution of caustic potash (Gerhardt); but prolonged
heating with alcoholic solution of caustic potash decomposes it
into <i>piperidine </i>and the <i>potassium salt of piperic acid </i>(v.
Babo and Keller), according to the following equation: C<font size="1">17</font>H<font size="1">19</font>NO<font size="1">3</font>+KOH=C<font size="1">12</font>H<font size="1">9</font>O<font size="1">4</font>K+C<font size="1">5</font>H<font size="1">11</font>N. <i>Piperin</i>,
reversedly, was synthesized from these constituents by L. Rügheimer
(1882). <i>Piperic acid </i>(C<font size="1">12</font>H<font size="1">10</font>O<font size="1">4</font>), being nearly
insoluble in water, may be precipitated from the solution of its
potassium salt by the addition of hydrochloric acid, and
recrystallized from alcohol. The acid forms yellow crystals,
melting at 150° C. (302° F.). According to Fittig and Mielck (1869),
it has the formula: CH<font size="1">2</font>:O<font size="1">2</font>:C<font size="1">6</font>H<font size="1">3</font>.CH:CH.CH:CH.COOH. The
potassium salt by oxidation yields <i>piperonal </i>(which see). <i>Piperidine
</i>(C<font size="1">5</font>H<font size="1">11</font>N) is a
volatile, strong base, which may be separated in the above
reaction by distillation with steam and collecting the vapors in
dilute acid. It has the odor of ammonia and pepper, and forms
well crystallizable salts with acids. Ladenburg, in 1885,
succeeded in obtaining piperidine by synthesis, proving it to be <i>hexa-hydro-pyridine
</i>(C<font size="1">5</font>H<font size="1">5</font>N.H<font size="1">6</font>, or CH<font size="1">2</font>:[CH.2CH<font size="1">2</font>]<font size="1">2</font>:NH).</p>

<p><b>Action, Medical Uses, and Dosage.</b>&#151;Formerly this
agent was frequently substituted for or used in conjunction with
the cinchona alkaloids in the treatment of <i>malarial fevers</i>.
Piperin is now occasionally employed in <i>intermittent fever</i>,
but will be found less efficient than the alcoholic extract of
black pepper. Its use has also been advised in <i>colic</i>, <i>diarrhoea,
cholera, scarlatina, chronic gonorrhoea, </i>and in solution as a
wash for <i>tinea capitis</i>. Piperin should not be administered
with astringents, as it is thereby rendered nearly inert. The
dose is 1 to 8 grains, 3 or 4 times a day (see <a href="../pepper/kad.piper.html"><i>Piper</i></a>).</p>

<p><b>Derivative of Piperin.</b>&#151;P<font size="2">IPERONAL</font>,
or H<font size="2">ELIOTROPIN</font> (C<font size="1">6</font>H<font size="1">6</font>O<font size="1">3</font>). This compound is an
aldehyde, the methylene ether of protocatchuic aldehyde, and has
the formula: CH<font size="1">2</font>:O<font size="1">2</font>:C<font size="1">6</font>H<font size="1">3</font>.CHO. Its corresponding
acid (CH<font size="1">2</font>:O<font size="1">2</font>:C<font size="1">6</font>H<font size="1">3</font>.COOH) is called <i>piperonylic
acid</i>. Piperonal is obtained by oxidizing the potassium salt
of <i>piperic acid </i>(see <i>Piperinum</i>; also see <a href="../pepper/kad.piper-meth.html"><i>Piper Methysticum</i></a>) with
potassium permanganate in neutral solution. It forms small, white
crystals, soluble in alcohol and ether, but sparingly soluble, in
cold water (1 in about 600). It resembles coumarin and vanillin
in odor, and is now manufactured for purposes of perfumery; but
it has also been given medicinally in 10 to 15-grain doses, every
3 hours, as an antipyretic and an antiseptic.</p>
