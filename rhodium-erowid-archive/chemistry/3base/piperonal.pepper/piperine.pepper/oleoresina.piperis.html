<p align="left">S<font size="2">YNONYMS:</font><i> Oleoresin of
black pepper, Ethereal extract </i>(or <i>Oil</i>) <i>of black
pepper</i>.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&#151;&quot;Pepper, in No. 60 powder, five
hundred grammes (500 Gm.) [1 lb. av., 1 oz., 279 grs.]; ether, a
sufficient quantity. Put the pepper into a cylindrical glass
percolator, provided with a stop-cock, and arranged with a cover
and receptacle for volatile liquids. Press the drug firmly, and
percolate slowly with ether, added in successive portions, until
the drug is exhausted. Recover the greater part of the ether from
the percolate by distillation on a water-bath, and, having
transferred the residue to a capsule, set this aside until the
remaining ether has evaporated, and the deposition of crystals of
piperin has ceased. Lastly, separate the oleoresin from the
piperin by expression through a muslin strainer. Keep the
oleoresin in a well-stoppered bottle&quot;&#151;(U. S. P.).</p>

<p><b>Description.</b>&#151;Oleoresin of pepper forms a dark,
greenish, rather thick liquid, containing volatile and fixed oil,
and the pepper-resin, and possessing all the active properties of
the pepper. About one-sixteenth part of the oleoresin is thus
obtained, mixed with <i>piperin</i>, which is removed by the
expression. This is not so dark in color, and contains more of
the volatile oil than <i>oil of black pepper</i>, once employed
and for which this oleoresin is a substitute. Oil of black pepper
is a dark, almost black-green body, and is obtained as a by-product
in the preparation of piperin.</p>

<p><b>Action, Medical Uses, and Dosage.</b>&#151;Oleoresin of
black pepper may be used in cases where the fruit itself is
indicated, in doses of from 1 to 3 or 4 drops, rubbed up with
mucilage, glycerin, syrup, or with pill mass.</p>
