<h3><a name="EtOH_KOH_reflux"></a><br>
isolation of piperine</h3>

<p>place 15g (1) of ... ground black pepper in a 250mL round-bottomed
flask,<br>
add 150mL of 95% ethanol and 5 boiling chips (2), and heat at
reflux for 2h.<br>
filter the mixture by suction filtration and then concentrate the
filtrate to a<br>
volume of 10-15mL by simple distillation or by use of a rotary
evaporator.<br>
to 10mL of a 10% solution of KOH in 95% ethanol contained ina 125mL<br>
erlenmeyer flask add the concentrated pepper extract. heat the
resulting<br>
solution and add water dropwise. a yellow precipitate forms. add
water<br>
until no more solid appears to form and then allow the mixture to
stand at<br>
least overnight (3). collect the solid by suction filtration and
recrystallize it<br>
with 10-20mL of acetone (4).<br>
<br>
(1) this extraction may be scaled up to twice the amounts
specified without<br>
difficultiy. if a soxhlet extractor is available, this would be
an apparatus superior<br>
to a standard reflux setup.<br>
<br>
(2) boiling chips are necessary to prevent serious bumping.<br>
<br>
(3) it is best to allow piperine to completely precipitate out by
allowing the<br>
mixture to stand until the next laboratory period.<br>
<br>
(4) in our hands ca. 0.6g of piperine, mp 127-128�C, was
collected upon<br>
recrystallization.<br>

<h3><a name="EtOH_KOH_soxhlet"></a><br>
isolation of piperine from black pepper</h3>

<p><u>procedure</u><br>
10g black pepper is ground to a fine powder and extracted with
150mL 95%<br>
ethanol in a soxhlet extractor for 2h. the solution is filtered
and concentrated in<br>
vacuo on a water bath at 60�C. 10mL 10% alcoholic KOH solution
is added ...<br>
and after a while decanted from the insoluble residue. the
alcoholic solution is<br>
left overnight, whereupon 0.3g yellow needles are deposited, mp
125-126�C.<br>
<br>
<u>TLC of black pepper extract</u><br>
the crude extract is spotted on a thin-layer plate (silica gel GF254)<br>
and developed with benzene:EtOAc 2:1.<br>
detection:<br>
(1) UV365 shows blue fluorescence of piperine<br>
(2) spraying with anisaldehyde-sulfric acid reagent, prepared by
mixing 0.5mL<br>
anisaldehyde with 10mL glacial acetic acid, 85mL MeOH, and 5mL
concentrated<br>
sulfric acid. this solution is sprayed on the plate, which is
then heated at 110�C<br>
for 10min. piperine appears as a yellow spot, Rf=0.25.<br>

<h3><a name="CaCO3"></a><br>
isolation of piperine from black pepper</h3>

<p>piperine, a very weakly basic substance, can be isolated from
a variety of peppers<br>
by extraction with alcohol. ... piperine, along with a small
amount of its Z,E isomer,<br>
accounts for about 10% of the weight of black pepper.<br>
<br>
<u>procedure</u><br>
place 15g of ground black pepper and 1g of powdered CaCO3 (1) in
a 250mL<br>
boiling flask, add 100mL of IPA, and, after fitting the flask
with a reflux condenser,<br>
boil the mixture for about 1h on the steam bath. at the end of
the heating period,<br>
filter the mixture by gravity into a 125mL erlenmeyer flask,
clean the 250mL<br>
boiling flask, and return the filtrate to the boiling flask. fit
the boiling flask with a<br>
distillation adapter and condenser, and boil off all but about 10mL
of the IPA (2).<br>
transfer the residual solution from the boiling flask to a 25mL
erlenmeyer flask,<br>
and set the flask aside to cool for crystallization of piperine (3,4).
collect the product<br>
by suction filtration, using small portions of MeOH to rinse the
flask and wash<br>
the product. yield: about 0.5g.<br>
<br>
(1) the addition of CaCO3 should prevent the extraction of acidic<br>
components of pepper<br>
<br>
(2) IPA boils at 80�C, only a little below the maximum
temperature attainable on<br>
the steam bath. to make the distillation proceed quickly, clamp
the boiling flask so<br>
that it is well down in the rings of the steam bath, and drape a
towel over the flask<br>
and the steam bath to make a tent that will hold steam around the
top of the flask.<br>
<br>
(3) crystallization occurs slowly, and the flask must be allowed
to stand for<br>
at least 24h.<br>
<br>
(4) alternatively, add 25mL of water to the IPA solution of
piperine, allow the mixture<br>
to stand for at least 24h so that precipitation will be complete,
collect the solid by<br>
sucction filtration, and recrystallize it from either IPA or
acetone.<br>

<h3><a name="CH2Cl2"></a><br>
isolation of piperine from black pepper</h3>

<p>add 5g of pure ground pepper and 10mL of CH2Cl2 to 50mL round-bottomed
flask.<br>
use the round-rottomed flask as the basis for a reflux apparatus
having a water-cooled<br>
condenser and heating mantle. heat the sample to reflux, and then
maintain a gentle<br>
reflux for 20min. after the required reflux period, lower the
heating mantle and allow the<br>
reflux apparatus to cool for 5min. suction filter the slurry with
the aid of a 4.5cm buchner<br>
funnel, washing the pepper grounds once with 5mL of CH2Cl2.
remove 2 or 3 drops of<br>
the extract and place it in a capped vial for use in the TLC
analysis. <br>
<br>
<u>trituration/isolation</u> <br>
transfer the extract obtained above to a clean 25mL round-bottomed
flask and<br>
concentrate in vacuo. the resulting olive-brown, viscous oil
should be cooled in an<br>
ice-bath and then 3mL of cold ether added to the oil while gently
stirring for 3-4min.<br>
some piperine may percipitate at this point, but remove the
solvent in vacuo anyway.<br>
once again coole the resulting oil in an ice-bath and then add 3mL
of cold ether to the<br>
oil while gently stirring to promote the percipitation of
piperine. allow the flask to cool<br>
for an additional 10min with occasional stirring. isolate the
straw-yellow crystals of<br>
crude piperine by suction filtration with the aid of a 1.5cm
hirsch funnel. wash the<br>
crystals twice with 2mL portions of cold ether. place a small
portion of the filtrate in a<br>
capped vial for use in the TLC analysis. <br>
<br>
<u>recrystallization </u><br>
place the crude piperine isolated above into a 13x100mm test tube
and dissolve it in a<br>
minimum amount of hot 3:2 acetone:hexane solution. once all the
solid has dissolved,<br>
allow the test tube to sit undisturbed for 15min at room
temperature. rod-like, yellow<br>
crystals of piperine should be present. cool the solution for an
additional 30min in an<br>
ice-bath before isolating the purified piperine by suction
filtartion with the help of a 1.5cm<br>
hirsch funnel. wash the crystals once with a 2mL portion of cold
ether, allow them to air<br>
dry for several minutes. typically, yields of approximately 2% or
100mg are obtained.<br>
the melting point of the purified piperine now can be determined
and the identity of the<br>
product confirmed by mixed melting point, TLC analysis, or
spectral analysis. <br>
<br>
<u>TLC analysis</u><br>
transfer a small portion of the purified crystals to a small vial
and dissolve them in a<br>
drop or two of acetone. prepare a silica-gel TLC plate for the
spotting of 4 samples<br>
(kieselgel 60 F254 plates having a 0.2mm coating thickness are
recomended).<br>
with the aid of a capillary, place a sample of the crude oil
remaining from the extraction<br>
procedure, a sample of the filtrate from the trituration/isolation
procedure, the sample<br>
prepared from the purified piperine, and a sample of a piperine
standard on separate<br>
points of the thin-layer plate. develop the plate using 3:2
acetone:hexane.<br>
visualize under UV illumination and stain in an iodine chamber. <br>

<p>grind 25g fresh peppercorns to a fine powder, place in a
soxhlet thimble, and extract<br>
with 100mL ethanol for 90 minutes. cool the resulting solution,
filter if necessary, and<br>
concentrate on the rotary evaporator. keep the water bath below
60�C during the<br>
concentration. dissolve the residue in 25mL 10% alcoholic KOH.
decant the solution<br>
if any residue remains. cool the solution in an ice bath, and add
water dropwise<br>
(about 30mL will be required) to precipitate the piperine.
collect the piperine on a<br>
sintered glass funnel, and dry it on the vacuum pump.<br>

piperine and piperiline extraction</h3>

<p>750g dry fruits of black pepper were ground and extracted with
2.5L ethanol, in a<br>
soxhlet apparatus for 72h. the extract was concentrated under
reduced pressure<br>
in a rotary evaporator to leave 8g of a dark brown oil. this
material was fractionated<br>
on a silica gel column, eluting with hexane + diethyl ether (1 +
2 by volume).<br>
the fractions obtained were combined according to their
similarities as analysed by<br>
thin layer chromatography (TLC) and this led to the isolation of
2g piperine and 0.3g<br>
piperiline. these compounds were recrystallised with a mixture of
dichloromethane<br>
and hexane and the physical and spectroscopic data obtained were
in accordance<br>
with those reported in the literature.<br>

<h3><a name="isolation_recover"></a><br>
process to recover piperine from resin of black pepper</h3>

<p>a reaction vessel was charged with 0.9kg urea, 3.7kg ethanol (or
2.7kg methanol)<br>
and 0.3kg of the resin of black pepper to form a mixture. the
mixture was refluxed<br>
for approximately 1h. the refluxed mixture was cooled overnight
to 0-5�C. the cooled<br>
mixture was then filtered to remove solids (e.g wax, urea, fatty
acids). the filtrate was<br>
then concentrated to obtain 180g of piperine and some unreacted
urea. the 180g of<br>
piperine was recrystallized by adding ethanol. the piperine
crystals were collected<br>
by filtration and dried to yield approximately 75g of 98% pure
piperine. <br>

<strong>&quot;process for making high purity piperine for
nutritional use&quot;</strong><br>
muhammed majeed, vladimir badmaev; sabinsa corp<u><br>
</u><strong><u>abstract</u></strong>: the present invention
relates to a process of making high purity<br>
piperine for nutritional and nutraceutical application. this
process recovers<br>
piperine from piperine-containing oleoresin by using isourea,
urea or a<br>
urea derivative to remove organic matter other than piperine from
the<br>
oleoresin. preferrably, the process recovers piperine from
oleoresin of fruit<br>
of piper nigrum or piper longum. more preferably, the process
recovers<br>
piperine from oleoresin of fruit of piper nigrum, i.e. black
pepper.<br>

<strong>&quot;microwave-assisted extraction of piperine from
piper nigrum&quot;</strong><br>
girija raman, vilas g gaikar<br>
<strong><u>abstract</u></strong><strong>:</strong> a novel
microwave-assisted technique (MAE) for the extraction of<br>
piperine from coarsely powdered black pepper (Piper nigrum) was
studied.<br>
the parameters such as nature of the solvent, microwave energy
input, and<br>
solid loading were optimized. the mechanism of the enhancement of
extraction<br>
rates was investigated by microscopic studies of the irradiated
material.<br>
studies have revealed that dielectric heating of the polar
cellular matrix resulted<br>
in remarkable swelling and coalescence of the oil cells and other
constituents.<br>
the resulting pressure, built-up within the cell, breaks open the
cell, releasing<br>
the constituents and providing easy access for solvent
penetration and<br>
subsequent solubilization of piperine and other substances.
because the cell wall<br>
is mainly composed of slightly ionic cellulose, there is a marked
increase in the<br>
dielectric heating rates. rapid degradation of the cellulosic
cell wall occurs,<br>
thereby further increasing the permeability of the wall toward
solvent penetration.<br>
selective extraction of piperine in nonpolar solvents to the
extent of 94% with a<br>
purity of 85% has been achieved. the MAE procedure is simple,
rapid, and reliable. <br>

<strong>&quot;stimulation of mouse melanocyte proliferation by<br>
piper nigrum fruit extract and its main alkaloid, piperine&quot;</strong><br>
zhixiu lin, j r s hoult, dorothy c bennett, amala raman<br>
<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> during a herbal screening
programme to find potential repigmenting agents<br>
for the treatment of vitiligo, piper nigrum l. fruit (black
pepper) extract was found to<br>
possess growth-stimulatory activity towards cultured melanocytes.
its aqueous extract<br>
at 0.1mg/ml was observed to cause nearly 300 % stimulation of the
growth of a cultured<br>
mouse melanocyte line, melan-a, in 8 days (p &lt; 0.01). piperine
(1-piperoylpiperidine),<br>
the main alkaloid from piper nigrum fruit, also significantly
stimulated melan-a cell growth.<br>
both piper nigrum extract and piperine induced morphological
alterations in melan-a cells,<br>
with more and longer dendrites observed. the augmentation of
growth by piperine was<br>
effectively inhibited by RO-31-8220, a selective protein kinase C
(PKC) inhibitor,<br>
suggesting that PKC signalling is involved in its activity. this
is the first full report on such<br>
an activity of black pepper and piperine.<br>

<strong>&quot;extraction of piperine from piper nigrum (black
pepper)<br>
by hydrotropic solubilization&quot;</strong><br>
girija raman, vilas g gaikar<br>
<strong><u>abstract:</u></strong> hydrotropes, such as sodium
alkyl benzene sulfonates and sodium butyl<br>
monoglycol sulfate, were used for the selective extraction of
piperine by cell<br>
permeabilization of piper nigrum fruits. penetration of the
hydrotrope molecules into<br>
the cellular structures and subsequent cell permeabilization were
hypothesized to<br>
explain the enhanced extraction rates of aqueous hydrotrope
solutions. hydrotrope<br>
molecules, after adsorption on a cell wall, cause disorder in its
structure and in the<br>
bilayered cell membrane to facilitate the rapid extraction of
piperine. the hydrotrope<br>
solution showed selective and rapid extraction of piperine from
black pepper.<br>
the recovered piperine was ~90% pure and substantially free from
oleoresins. the<br>
type and nature of the hydrotrope, the hydrotrope concentration,
the temperature,<br>
and the particle size all had significant effects on the
extraction process.<br>
