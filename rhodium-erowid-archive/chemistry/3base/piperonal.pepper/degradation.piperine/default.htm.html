degradation of piperine</h2>

<p>1g piperine and 10mL 10% alcoholic potassium hydroxide are
refluxed for 90min.<br>
the ethanolic solution is evaporated to dryness under reduced
pressure, the receiver<br>
being cooled in an ice-salt bath. the solid potassium piperinate
is suspended in hot<br>
water and acidified with hydrochloric acid. the voluminous yellow
percipitate is collected<br>
on a buchner funnel, washed with cold water, and recrystalized
from ethanol to yield<br>
piperic acid as yellow needels of mp 216-217�C. the strongly
basic ethanolic distillate<br>
in the receiver is saturated with hydrochloric acid and
evaporated to dryness to give<br>
piperidine hydrochloride, which melts at 244�C after
recrystallization from ethanol.<br>

<h2><a name="degradation_properties"></a><br>
preparation and properties of piperic acid</h2>

<p>the cleavage of piperine was accomplished with alcoholic KOH
... . numerous<br>
experiments showed us that the following procedure is the most
practical and<br>
gives almost the theoretical yield. in a roomy flask connected
with an ascending<br>
cooler a mixture of 1 part fine grinded piperine with 1 part KOH
and 5 parts<br>
usual alcohol is boiled mildly about 24h in a water-bath.<br>
...<br>
in our experiments the decomposition was finished largely after
24h heating. after<br>
cooling the precipitation consisting of yellowish glossing
leaflets was separated<br>
through a cheesecloth from the dark piperidine containing mother
liquor, washed<br>
out with cold alcohol and recrystallized a few times from hot
water under addition<br>
of animal coal. so the piperic acid potassium salt is obtained
very easily pure in<br>
completely colorless, warty grouped prisms, that become again
yellow colored at<br>
light. - the filtered acoholic mother liquor gives, if boiled 24h
anew with one third of<br>
the prior applied KOH amount, another small amount of very
impure, dark colored<br>
piperic acid potassium salt.<br>
...<br>
to obtail the free acid, the potassium salt was dissolved in
about 50 parts boiling<br>
water, a small excess of hydrochloric acid was brought into the
solution and the<br>
whole was heated for some time. the piperic acid was obtained as
a lightish<br>
sulphur-yellow, amorphous, looser precipitation. ... after the
washing and drying<br>
the acid was recrystallized from boiling alcohol. for the
dissolution of 1 part piperic<br>
acid about 50 parts alcohol were required.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="hydrolysis"></a><br>
hydrolysis of piperine to piperic acid and piperidine</h2>

<p>... place 1g of piperine and 10mL of a 10% solution of KOH in
95% ethanol in<br>
a 50mL round-bottomed flask. attach a condenser and heat at
reflux for 90min.<br>
attach the flask to an apparatus suitable for distillation under
reduced pressure.<br>
using an aspirator distill until dryness (1) and collect the
distillate in an ice cooled<br>
receiver flask. scrape the residue into a 125mL erlenmeyer flask
(use water to rinse<br>
material clinging to the sides of the round-bottomed flask).
suspend the residue<br>
in a total volume of about 50mL of water, heat over a steam bath,
and then acidify<br>
(in the hood) with hydrochloric acid. occasionally swirl the
erlenmeyer flask.<br>
collect the voluminous yellow precipitate of piperic acid by
suction filtration, wash<br>
with cold water, and recrystallize from hot ethanol (2).<br>
note the odor of the distillate. check the distillate with litmus
or pH paper (3).<br>
<br>
(1) bumping may occur at this step.<br>
<br>
(2) the yield of crude piperic acid is high. the melting point of
the recrystallized acid<br>
is 214-215�.<br>
<br>
(3) the hydrochloride salt of piperidine may be isolated ...;
however we have found<br>
this to be difficult and probably not worth the effort.<br>

<h2><a name="preparation_of_piperic_acid"></a><br>preparation of 5-(3,4-methylenedioxy phenyl)-<br>
2E,4E-pentadienoic acid (piperic acid)</h2>

<p>
piperine (28.0g, 98mmol, mp 132�C) dissolved in 200mL ethylene glycol<br>
and refluxed at 180�C after adding 25g potassium hydroxide and after<br>
the completion of the reaction the contents diluted with sufficient<br>
amount of water and acidified with 2N HCl. the resulting precipitate<br>
filtered and dried to give crude product which on crystallisation from<br>
ethanol gave piperic acid (13.8g, 65%, mp 217�C) as pale yellow solid<br>
(lit. mp 217�C).(27)<br>

<h2><a name="piperinic_acid"></a><br>preparation of piperinic acid</h2>

<p>
to piperine (2g, 0.7mmol, 1eq), 20% of methanolic KOH (100mL) was added and<br>
refluxed for 2days. after completition of the hydrolysis, methanol was removed<br>
under reduced pressure and a yellow coloured oily solid was obtained. this<br>
residue was dissolved in 50mL water and acidified with 6N HCl to pH<1 yielding<br>
a yellowish percipitate of piperinic acid. recrystallization from methanol<br>
gave yellow needles (0.9g, 60% yield)). mp 206�-208�C (lit mp 217�-218� (1))<br>

<h2><a name="degradation_preparation"></a><br>
preparation of piperic acid</h2>

<p>in a 1L round-bottom fask was placed 6g piperine, 500mL
ethanol and 100mL<br>
aqueous LiOH 90g/L solution. the resultant solution was refuxed
for 140h, and<br>
the reaction was then quenched by addition of 35mL concentrated
hydrochloric<br>
acid. the solid formed was removed by filtration and
recrystalized from THF to<br>
produce piperic acid in 85% yield, mp 126-127�C.<br>
<br>
[<a href="default.htm.html#09">09</a>]<br>
<br>
(mp 126-127�C looks like an error. it seems that 1 and 2 are
permuted.<br>
other papers report mp 216-217�C. also 140h sounds extremely
long [3base])</p>

<strong><u>abstract</u></strong><strong>:</strong> the natural
lipophilic amides piperine and piperiline were isolated<br>
from piper nigrum l (piperaceae). piperine was hydrolysed into
piperic acid<br>
(85% yield) which was converted into 16 amides (28-89% yield).
the contact<br>
toxicity of all synthetic amides, and also that of piperine and
piperiline, at the<br>
dose 10 �g per insect, was evaluated for the brazilian
economically important<br>
insects ascia monuste orseis latr, acanthoscelides obtectus say,
brevicoryne<br>
brassicae l, protopolybia exigua de saus and cornitermes cumulans

the results demontrated that the insects have different
sensivities to the various<br>
amides, with mortality ranging from 0 to 97.5% according to the
compound<br>
and insect species.<br>
