<h2>SASSAFRAS OIL</h2>

<h3>DESCRIPTION AND USES</h3>

<p>There are two important sassafras oils of commerce: Brazilian
sassafras oil, obtained from the trunkwood of <i>Ocotea pretiosa</i>,
and Chinese sassafras oil from <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>. Both
contain 80 percent or more of safrole. </p>

<p>True sassafras oil, from the roots of North American <i>Sassafras
albidum</i>, is no longer produced commercially, although it was
once the main flavour constituent of &quot;root beer&quot;. Its
use for such purposes, and in other foods and drinks, has been
banned for some years because of fears of health risks associated
with consumption of safrole. </p>

<p>Only Brazilian and Chinese oils are discussed here, together
with oils from <i>Piper</i> species, which show considerable
promise as alternative, sustainable sources of safrole. </p>

<p>Sassafras oil was formerly used in numerous household
fragrance applications such as floor waxes, polishes, soaps,
detergents and cleaning agents. Its ability to blend with other
oils and its powerful masking properties made it valuable for
such purposes. </p>

<p>However, the principal use today is as a raw material for the
isolation of safrole. This is then converted by the chemical
industry into two important derivatives: heliotropin, which is
widely used as a fragrance and flavouring agent, and piperonal
butoxide (PBO), a vital ingredient of pyrethroid insecticides.
Natural pyrethrum in particular would not be an economical
insecticide without the addition of PBO as a synergist and the
future of the natural pyrethrum industry is linked to the
continued availability of PBO. </p>

<h3>WORLD SUPPLY AND DEMAND TRENDS</h3>

<h3>Markets</h3>

<p>Excluding the People's Republic of China, for which
consumption levels are not known, demand for sassafras oil is
estimated to be around 2,000 tonnes annually. Most of this is
destined for heliotropin and PBO manufacture, the two outlets
taking approximately equal amounts of oil. </p>

<p>Exports of sassafras oil from Brazil for the period 1986-90
are given in Table 5, which also shows the destinations for the
two years 1986 and 1987. </p>

<p>Japan, Italy and the United States are the most important
markets for the oil (the latter being the largest market for
applications other than derivative manufacture). These countries,
along with some other minor manufacturers, then export the
heliotropin and PBO worldwide. Brazil has some manufacturing
capacity for both heliotropin and PBO (equivalent to about 500
tonnes of sassafras oil) although a shortage of domestically
produced oil has led to it importing some Chinese oil. </p>

<p>The demand for sassafras oil is determined by the markets for
heliotropin and PBO. Heliotropin consumption is increasing,
particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and some developing
countries, and sassafras oil is the preferred raw material for
its manufacture. If supplies of the oil become tight, however, or
its price rises markedly, then synthetic heliotropin would become
more attractive. </p>

<p>Demand for PBO, both in conventional pyrethroid insecticides
and in other insecticidal outlets now being developed, is also
increasing but, in this case, the possibility of utilizing
synthetic PBO to make up any shortage of sassafras oil-derived
PBO is less attractive economically. The overall prospects for a
sassafras type of oil are therefore very good. </p>

<h4>Supply sources</h4>

<p>More than half the sassafras oil currently entering world
trade originates from the People's Republic of China. While this
is likely to remain the case in the near future, Chinese domestic
requirements for the oil will increase as technology for the
manufacture of PBO is acquired and added to that which already
exists for heliotropin production. This, together with supply
difficulties caused by the destructive nature of production from
wild <i>C. camphora</i>, means that in the longer term there are
likely to be increasing amounts of sassafras oil diverted from
exports to internal use. </p>

<p>Up until the 1960s, Brazil was the major exporter of sassafras
oil. Production has declined since then as a result of depletion
of the natural resource from which it is obtained, wild <i>O.
pretiosa</i> in the Mata Atlantica areas of southern Brazil.
Restrictions imposed on the felling of the trees in the late 1980s
have resulted in a further decline in production and this is
illustrated by the falling level of Brazilian exports (Table 5). </p>

<p>Since 1990, Viet Nam has been exporting sassafras oil. Current
exports are believed to be of the order of several hundred tonnes
pa, but with reliance, again, on wild trees (<i>C. camphora</i>),
it is expected that supplies from this source will be relatively
short-lived. </p>

<p>The current dependence worldwide on unsustainable exploitation
of wild forest trees means that supplies from these sources will
progressively reduce. </p>

<h4>Quality and prices</h4>

<p>Brazilian sassafras oil is traditionally described in trade
terms as containing 84 percent safrole, although it usually
contains a few per cent more. Chinese oil has a higher
specification, 90 percent safrole, as a result of its method of
production. (It is obtained not as a whole oil but as a safrole-rich
fraction from the crude oil distilled from <i>C. camphora</i>.
The major fraction consists chiefly of camphor.) </p>

<p>For conversion into heliotropin or PBO a minimum safrole
content of 86 percent is preferred. The abundance of chemically
similar compounds in the oil, such as methyl eugenol, should be
low. </p>

<p>For some time, prices of sassafras oil were of the order of
US$4/kg. During a brief shortage of sassafras in 1991/92 (caused
largely by speculative stock-piling in the Far East) prices of
Chinese oil were around the US$6-7/kg level. When this shortage
was remedied prices eased and in early 1994 Chinese sassafras oil
was on offer from London dealers at under US$4/kg. Brazilian
prices are usually higher than those for Chinese oil. </p>

</TBODY></table>

<h4>Description and distribution</h4>

<p><i>Ocotea pretiosa</i> is a medium-sized tree which grows wild
in many parts of southeastern Brazil as well as Columbia and
Paraguay. It has only ever been exploited commercially for oil
production, however, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. It
is only here that trees with a suitably high safrole content are
found. </p>

<p><i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> occurs throughout much of Southeast
Asia but its exact distribution and abundance are not known with
any certainty. Large areas of wild trees once grew in Japan and
Taiwan but these have largely disappeared through over-exploitation
for camphor production in the years up to the Second World War.
The botanical status of <i>C. camphora</i> and its varieties is
also complex and there are several different chemotypes (see
CINNAMOMUM OILS). </p>

<h4>Effects of oil production on the natural resource</h4>

<p>In both Brazil and the People's Republic of China, loss of
trees by felling for oil production has been considerable. As
mentioned earlier, concern over this led the Brazilian government
to introduce regulations limiting the cutting of <i>O. pretiosa</i>.
In the early years of the Brazilian industry trees over fifty
years of age were common and yielded large amounts of oil. Today,
the resource is seriously depleted and tree diameters are
comparatively small. No significant replanting has ever occurred.
Expressions of concern over the depletion of <i>C. camphora</i>
have also been voiced by Chinese researchers. </p>

<h3>HARVESTING/PRIMARY PROCESSING</h3>

<p>In Brazil, trees are felled and cut into suitably sized logs
for transportation to the distillery. There they are chipped and
reduced further in size before being placed in the distillation
vessels. Steam is raised by burning waste and spent wood.
Distilleries are a mix of family and larger-sized operations. </p>

<p>Little information is available on the details of processing <i>C.
camphora</i> in the People's Republic of China or Viet Nam. The
crude oil obtained by primary distillation of the chipped wood is
fractionated to remove camphor and furnish a safrole-rich oil. </p>

<h4>Yields and quality variation</h4>

<p>In both <i>O. pretiosa</i> and <i>C. camphora</i> oil yields
are variable and dependant upon the quality of the wood feedstock.
Higher yields are obtained from trunkwood from older trees and
branchwood gives lower yields than trunkwood. Yields and oil
composition undoubtedly vary, both within and between natural
populations of trees, but the extent of this variation has not
been well documented. A chemotype of <i>O. pretiosa</i>, which
yields an oil rich in methyl eugenol, is known to occur in Brazil
although its geographical distribution is distant from the Santa
Catarina harvesting areas. Information is not available on the
yields of oil obtained from coppiced <i>C. camphora</i>; the
multiplicity of compositional types for the species is referred
to elsewhere (see CINNAMOMUM OILS). </p>

<h3>VALUE-ADDED PROCESSING</h3>

<p>A large part of the total production of Brazilian and Chinese
sassafras oil is exported whole to those importing countries
where conversion to heliotropin and PBO takes place. Some
manufacture of both derivatives occurs in Brazil and in the
People's Republic of China heliotropin is produced. The products
in both countries are then used partly to meet domestic needs and
partly to serve overseas customers. </p>

<h3>PRODUCTS OTHER THAN OIL</h3>

<p>The value of the trees for oil production means that they are
rarely used for other purposes. </p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENTAL POTENTIAL</h3>

<p>In the case of <i>C. camphora</i>, there is the potential for
regeneration after felling the tree due to its ability to coppice
but no information is available on the practicality or economics
of this. The possibility of utilizing other <i>Cinnamomum</i>
species as sources of safrole, not only in the People's Republic
of China but elsewhere in Southeast Asia, is discussed briefly in
the section on CINNAMOMUM OILS. </p>

<p>For <i>O. pretiosa</i>, the prospects of bringing it into
formal cultivation - a necessary measure, since the depleted
natural resource is now incapable of sustaining high levels of
utilization - are unknown but may prove uneconomic. Like <i>Aniba</i>
(see ROSEWOOD OIL) much basic information is lacking and, while
this could be acquired through a concerted research effort, a
more satisfactory outcome is likely to be obtained from research
into alternative sources of safrole. The potential of certain <i>Piper</i>
species to provide such an alternative in Brazil is therefore
discussed below. </p>

<h3>PIPER SPECIES AS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SAFROLE</h3>

<p>Certain forest shrubs of the Piperaceae family, indigenous to
the humid forests of Central America and Greater Amazonia, have
been found to contain high levels of safrole in their leaves.
With further research they offer good prospects as new,
commercial sources of safrole. Their successful development would
also bring other social and economic benefits, albeit on a modest
scale, to a region which is at the centre of world attention on
environmental issues. </p>

<p><i>Piper auritum</i> occurs from Mexico to Panama and is one
species which has attracted attention. The leaf oil contains
around 70 percent safrole and pilot-scale cultivation and
distillation trials were conducted for a brief period in Mexico
in the 1980s at INIREB, Xalapa. There appears to be no current
work being conducted on this species and its potential remains
uncertain. </p>

<p>The Brazilian Amazon contains a wide variety of <i>Piper</i>
species and since 1990 attention has been focused on two with
high safrole content in their leaves, <i>P. hispidinervium</i>
and <i>P. callosum</i>. This work has been funded by ODA and has
been undertaken by the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem in
collaboration with the Centre for Agroforestry Research (CPAF-EMBRAPA)
in Acre and supported by technical assistance from NRI. Progress
to the end of 1992 has been reported by MAIA et al. (1993).
Subsequently, <i>P. collosum</i> has been relegated in the
research work in favour of the more promising <i>P.
hispidinervium</i>. </p>

<p>The discussion on <i>P. hispidinervium</i> which follows is
intended to highlight the developmental potential of the species
and the ways in which research are being directed. The same basic
approach can be applied to many other situations where it is
required to bring wild forest species into semi-formal
cultivation. </p>

<p><b><i>P. hispidinervium</i></b><b> as an example of a species
suitable for agroforestry intervention</b> </p>

<p><i>P. hispidinervium</i> is most frequently found on degraded
forest or farm land where it occurs as a colonizing &quot;weed&quot;,
either as a pure stand or along with other <i>Piper</i> species.
Surveys have revealed that it occurs in the majority of settled
areas throughout Acre state in Brazil and it is believed to
extend into Amazonas state as well as Peru and Bolivia. On
natural sites, plants develop initially into bushes and at an
early stage they appear to inhibit growth of competing vegetation.
As the plants age they become more tree-like and stands up to 10
m in height may be found. </p>

<p>Techniques for propagation have been developed and growing
trials established at several sites in Brazil using both rooted
cuttings and seedlings. The trials are designed to provide
information on growth characteristics and biomass yields (leaf +
stem) under various planting and management regimes. Pilot-scale
distillations have been conducted to determine oil quality and
yields and permit estimation of productivity on a &quot;per
hectare per year&quot; basis. Only by such means, together with
knowledge of prevailing and projected oil prices, can economic
returns to the farmer be calculated. The safrole content of the
oil in unselected stock is about 85 percent. Improvement to 90
percent appears possible through selection. </p>

<p>Results to date indicate that the most likely form of
exploitation is one in which the plants are first harvested at 6-8
months, with subsequent harvests at 4-6 month intervals for at
least 3 years. Harvesting entails simply cutting the primary or
re-growth stems approximately 20 cm above ground level. </p>

<p>Mixed planting of <i>P. hispidinervium</i> with young cash
crop trees is a practical possibility and would be economically
attractive to a farmer. Harvesting of <i>P. hispidinervium</i>
would permit an early cash return during the period before the
first harvest of the tree crop. </p>

<h4>Further research needs</h4>

<p>Development of <i>P. hispidinervium</i> to a point where it
can be recommended to farmers for planting requires further
research and reappraisal and this is in hand. The following areas
of study are included in this programme. They may be taken as a
general guide to the approach necessary for the development of
any other forest crop. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Observation of the species in its natural habitat to
    learn more about its variability and ecological requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Identification of superior germplasm for planting
    purposes. A larger number of natural populations needs to be
    sampled and tested for oil yield, quality (safrole content)
    and growth characteristics (biomass production).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Determination of the best method of propagation (vegetative
    or from seed) in terms of survival, vigour and growth of the
    plants and the speed and ease of mass multiplication.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Assessment of growth performance and oil production of
    selected planting stock at more sites to determine optimum
    climatic and edaphic conditions and the adaptation range of
    the species. In due course, this should be extended to on-farm
    trials to determine probable production costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- The effects of spacing, fertilizer application and
    cropping interval on biomass and oil yields.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Closer monitoring of the seasonality of oil production
    within the plant in order to better assess the optimum time
    for harvesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Identification, through socio-economic studies, of
    farmers who would adopt and benefit from production.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Determination of the optimum form of management of the
    combined cultivation/distillation operation (i.e. are the
    plants best grown and distilled on a family basis using small-scale
    field stills; on a cooperative system; or by outgrowers
    supplying a large, central distillery?).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Specification of marketing systems (farmer to buyer).</p>
