<h2>II. Distillation of essential oils</h2>

<p>Essential oils are aromatic materials of vegetable origin,
which are used in perfumery and flavourings. They represent the
&quot;essential aroma&quot; of the plant from which they are
obtained. The majority of essential oils are produced by the
process of steam distillation.</p>

<h3>2.1 Raw materials / processing</h3>

<p>Essential oils occur in many different parts of plants, e.g.
roots (vetiver), bark (cinnamon), heartwood (sandalwood), leaves
(bay), herb (peppermint), seeds (nutmeg), flowers (cananga and
jasmine).</p>

<p>The essential oil of a plant consists of many compounds which
generally boil between 150° 300° C. If attempts are made to
remove these compounds by dry distillation many will decompose
and the oil will be ruined. However, the compounds are steam
volatile and can be distilled out of the vegetal materials at
around 100° C.</p>

<p>When plant materials are steam distilled chemical changes
inevitably occur and the oil obtained will not have an identical
aroma to that of the original plant material.</p>

<p>Preparation of material for distillation varies with the
material to be distilled. Some material must be distilled
immediately after harvesting, whereas others can be (and are best)
stored for a day or two before distilling and finally there are
materials which can be stored indefinitely before distillation.
In general, flowers should be distilled immediately, whereas
herbaceous material often benefits from wilting for one or two
days before distillation. Woody materials may need to be ground
and/or soaked before distillation.</p>

<p>The preparation of the raw material, the packing of the still
and the rate/type of distillation can be determined for a
particular essential oil crop from the literature or from
experimental trials.</p>

<h3>2.2 Types of distillation</h3>

<p>There are three basic types of essential oil distillation:</p>

<ol type="i">
    <li>water or &quot;hydrodistillation&quot; </li>
    <li>water and steam or &quot;wet steam&quot; </li>
    <li>steam or &quot;dry steam&quot; </li>
</ol>

<p>i. &quot;Hydrodistillation&quot; - in this method the charge (which
is usually comminuted) is immersed totally in water which is
boiled. The stills are of the simplest type (see <a href="fig1.gif" target="_blank">Figure 1: Simple still
hydrpdistillation</a> ) and are used extensively by smallholder
producers of essential oils. Often they are heated over an open
fire. The disadvantages are that the heat is difficult to control
and hence the rate of distillation is variable. Also the
possibility exists for local overheating and &quot;burning&quot;
of the charge which can lead to a poorer quality oil. Improved
distillation control can be obtained by using steam from a
separate boiler, which is passed into a jacket around the still
or through a closed coil in the bottom of the still, to heat the
contents of the still. A further disadvantage of this system is
that it requires the heating of a large quantity of water adding
to costs and time needed for each distillation. However, it is
necessary for certain flower distillations e.g. rose and ylang.
It is also necessary for the efficient distillation of certain
woody materials e.g. sandalwood and cinnamon bark. </p>

<p>ii. Water/steam distillation this is an improved method, the
still contains a grid which keeps the plant material above the
water level (<a href="fig2.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 2. Water/Steam
still</a>) The water is boiled below the charge and &quot;wet&quot;
steam passes through the plant material. Consequently, if an open
fire is used the plant material is protected from direct heat. In
Fig. 2 the still is heated by a steam jacket. It is important in
both water/steam and steam distillation that the still is packed
evenly and not too tightly so that steam can extract from the
complete charge efficiently. Over packing of the still can cause
the steam to force &quot;rat holes&quot; through the charge and
leave other parts of the charge unextracted.</p>

<p>iii. Steam Distillation - the most advanced type of
distillation is by direct steam provided from a separate boiler.
The still contains a grid plate under which an open steam pipe is
fitted (see <a href="fig3.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 3. Steam
distillation unit</a>).</p>

<p>The advantages of this type of &quot;dry&quot; steam
distillation are that it is relatively rapid, therefore charging
and emptying the still is much faster and energy consumption is
lower. The rapid distillation is also less likely to damage those
oils which contain reactive compounds, e.g. esters</p>

<p>As a general rule all stills should be insulated (&quot;lagged&quot;)
to reduce heat losses. Their design and losses . Their design and
construction should also facilitate loading and unloading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Condensers and Separators</strong></p>

<p>The steam containing essential oil vapour leaves the still and
passes into a condenser by way of a &quot;gooseneck&quot; (<a href="fig4.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 4. Btillhead/Gooseneck</a>
). Some sort of gauze or screen is often fitted at the mouth of
the gooseneck to prevent plant material being blown over into the
condenser.</p>

<p>In the condenser the vapours are cooled and condense. The
simple form of condenser is shown in Fig. 5. (see <a href="fig5.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 5. Coil condenser</a>. The
vapours pass through a coiled tube contained in a water bath and
condensate is obtained at the bottom of the condenser tube. It is
important that condensation is complete or oil may be lost by
evaporation.</p>

<p>A more efficient type of condenser is the multi-tubular type
shown in Fig. 6 (see <a href="fig6.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 6.
Multi-tubular condenser</a>) in which a series of parallel tubes
are mounted inside a cylindrical jacket through which cooling
water is passed. This design provides a large surface area for
cooling in relation to its volume.</p>

<p>The mixture of water and essential oil leaves the condenser
and flows into a separator, called a florentine flask, in which
they separate into two layers.</p>

<p>The essential oil will generally be lighter than water, the
oil floats to the surface and the distillate water drains away.</p>

<p><a href="fig7.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 7. Lighter-than-water
separator</a></p>

<p>It is important that the oil separators should be large enough
in volume to minimize turbulence because significant amounts of
oil can be lost with the distillate water if the oil is not
allowed to separate completely. In addition, the temperature of
the distillate may have an important bearing on the efficiency of
separation of essential oil and water. The optimum temperature
for obtaining the best separation can be found by trial and error.
Sometimes when separation of oil is difficult, the distillate
water is run back into the still (cohobation) and redistilled.</p>

<p><a href="fig8.gif" target="_blank">Fig. 8. Heavier-than-water
separator</a></p>

<p>Condensers and separators should be constructed of materials
which do not react with essential oils or water. Mild steel rusts
and is not suitable. However, copper has been used successfully
for many years tend tinned copper were cooper reacts with the oil).
The optimum material for stills, condensers and separators is
stainless steel which is resistant and durable but is relatively
expensive.</p>

<h3>2.3 Storage and packaging</h3>

<p>Most essential oils can be stored for long periods under
suitable conditions: they should be dry, not in contact with the
air or direct sunlight and kept cool.</p>

<p>It is important that essential oils do not come into contact
with materials with which they might react, e.g. rubber or
plastic bungs.</p>

<p>Glass containers are often used for smaller amounts of oil but
larger quantities are invariably stored in metal drums. Mild
steel drums lined with epoxy resin are very popular for essential
oils. If secondhand drums are to be used, it is important that
they are thoroughly cleaned and dried before being filled with
essential oil. Plastic containers, e.g. polythene, should not be
used because the oil may be absorbed by the plastic and
contamination may occur. To ensure that the oil is not wet it
should be left to stand for some time before being filtered into
its container. Oils generally show no cloudiness when thoroughly
dry.</p>

<p>Freshly distilled oils often possess some &quot;still odours&quot;
which are unpleasant. These generally disappear after several
weeks storage. Some oils gradually improve in storage and acquire
a fuller more rounded aroma, e.g. vetiver and patchouli.</p>
