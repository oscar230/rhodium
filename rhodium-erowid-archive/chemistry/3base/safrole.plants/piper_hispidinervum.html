<p><i>Piper hispidinervum</i> (C. DC.), Piperaceae, is a
promising source of sassafras oil, the source of safrol,
currently derived from endangered plants of the Lauraceae such as
<i>Ocotea pretios</i> Ness (Mez.), <i>Cinamomum petrophilum</i>, <i>C.
mollissimum</i>, and <i>Sassafras albidum</i> Nutt. The essential
oil of <i>P. hispidinervum </i>contains high levels (83&#150;93%)
of safrole in leaves which can be easily extracted by
hydrodistillation. <a name="safrole"></a></p>

<h2>SAFROLE</h2>

<p>Safrol a phenolic ether (Tyler et al. 1982), is a colorless or
slightly yellow liquid, C<font size="2"><sub>10</sub></font>H<font size="2"><sub>10</sub></font>O<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>,
molecular wt 162.18, with density of 1.096 at 20�C, and melting
point about 11�C. The oil is insoluble in water, very soluble in
alcohol, miscible with ether and chloroform. The DL<font size="2"><sub>50</sub></font>
(oral) is 1.950 mg/kg in rats and 2.350 mg/kg in mice (Budavaris
1989).</p>

<p>Sassafras oil is important to several products. It was used as
an ingredient in popular beverages, such as &quot;pinga com
sassafras&quot; in Brazil, and was once used as an ingredient for
&quot;root beer&quot; in the United States. It has been used as a
topical antiseptic and pediculicide, but it may be carcinogenic.</p>

<p>Safrole is an important raw material for the chemical industry
because of two derivatives: heliotropin, which is widely used as
a fragrance and flavoring agent, and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a
vital ingredient of pyrethroid insecticides. Natural pyrethrum in
particular would not be an economical insecticide without the
addiction of PBO as a synergist and the future of the natural
pyrethrum industry is linked to the continued availability of PBO.
Safrole has many fragrance applications in household products
such as floor waxes, polishes, soaps, detergents, and cleaning
agents.<a name="markets"></a></p>

<h3>Markets and Demand</h3>

<p>Japan, Italy, and the United States are the most important
markets for sassafras oil, and the total annual demand is
estimated to be around 2,000 tonnes. Brazil has manufacturing
capacity for both heliotropin and PBO (equivalent to about 500 t
of sassafras oil), although a shortage of domestically produced
oil has led to importations of oil from China. The worldwide
sassafras oil price is US$4 to 6/kg.</p>

<p>The demand for sassafras oil is determined by the market for
heliotropin and PBO. Heliotropin consumption is increasing,
particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia, and some developing
countries, and sassafras oil is the favorite raw material for its
manufacture. If price rises markedly, synthetic heliotropin would
become more attractive.<a name="sources"></a></p>

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>In Brasil, sassafras oil has been extracted commercially from <i>Ocotea
pretiosa</i>, a perennial tree native to coastal tropical
rainforests from Bahia to Santa Catarina, in Mata Atlantica. This
species is also found in Colombia and Paraguay (Rizzini and Mors
1995). This was based on a discovery in l939 that wood
distillation from a large tree in the state of Santa Catarina
yielded a rich source of sassafras oil, containing 84% safrole.
These trees were indiscriminately harvested, placing this species
on the endangered list. Until the 1960s, Brazil was the major
exporter of sassafras oil in the world, but production has
declined with the depletion of this natural resource.
Governmental restrictions in the late 1980s have resulted in a
further decline in production and in the falling level of
Brazilian exports. No significant replanting has ever occurred.</p>

<p>Vietnam has been exported sassafras oil since 1990 from wild
trees of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>, but supplies from this
source may be relatively short-lived. Current exports are
estimated to be several hundred tonnes/year. <a name="piper"></a></p>

<h2><i>PIPER HISPIDINERVUM</i> AS A SAFROLE SOURCE </h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, certain forest shrubs of the Piperaceae,
indigenous to the humid forests of Central America and Greater
Amazonia, were found to contain high levels of safrole in their
leaves. The Brazilian Amazon contains a wide variety of <i>Piper</i>
species but attention had focused on <i>P. hispidinervum</i> and <i>P.
callosum</i>, two species with high safrole content.
Subsequently, <i>P. callosum</i> has been dropped in the research
work in favor of the more promising <i>P. hispidinervum</i>. This
effort was carried out by Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Bel�m
in collaboration with the Center for Agroforestry Research (CPAF-EMBRAPA)
in Acre. </p>

<p><i>Piper hispidinervum</i> known as &quot;pimenta-longa&quot;
in Brazil, has been described by Yunker (1972). It is a nodose,
branching shrub with rather slender upper internodes, somewhat
angular, mostly 1&#150;3 cm long, glabrous or very sparsely
pubescent, somewhat glandular dotted. Leaves are oblong-lanceolate
or elliptic-oblong, with attenuately acuminate apex and
inequilateral base. This species resembles <i>Piper aduncum</i> L.
to some extent but differs in its scarcely scabrous leaves,
glabrous stem, and short peduncle (Yunker 1972). Coppen (1995)
suggests that this species is distributed throughout South
America, and is especially prominent in the state of Acre in
Brazil and may extend into Amazonas. </p>

<p>The species is most frequently found on degraded forest,
bordering primary forest or farm land where it occurs as a
colonizing &quot;weed,&quot; either as a pure stand or along with
other <i>Piper</i> species. On natural sites, plants develop
initially into bushes and at an early stage they appear to
inhibit growth of competing vegetation. As the plants age they
become more tree-like, up to 10 m tall.</p>

<p>Pilot-scale distillations have been conduced to determine oil
quality and yields and permit estimation annual productivity on a
per hectare basis. The safrole content of the oil in unselected
stock is about 85%, but a improvement to more than 90% is
possible through selection. Leaves of <i>P. hispidinervum </i>in
experimental plots of CPAF-EMBRAPA (Acre) contained 3% essential
oils of which 93% is safrole.<a name="culture"></a></p>

<h3>Management and Culture</h3>

<p>Mixed planting of <i>P. hispidinervum</i> with cash tree crops
is a practical possibility and would be economically attractive
as leaf harvesting would permit an early cash return. Another
production possibility is sustainable management in natural
vegetation since it occurs in high populations in several open
areas bordering primary rainforest. Reforestation projects, in
natural or deforested gaps, could take advantage of the
vegetative and productive potential of <i>P. hispidinervum</i>
since it is a pioneer species.</p>

<p><i>Piper hispidinervum</i> offers excellent conditions for
cultivation in areas with facilities for harvest, transport, and
industrialization (Chaves 1994). Trials have been established at
several sites in Brazil using both rooted cuttings and seedlings
designed to provide information in both growth characteristics
and biomasss yields (leaf + stem) under various planting and
management regimes. Studies undertaken in laboratories of the
Department of Horticulture, FCA&#150;UNESP, Botucatu,
demonstrated that this plant is positively photoblastic with 50%
germination under sunlight but none in the dark.</p>

<p>Crop density studies in Acre state by Sousa et al. (1997)
indicate that the highest biomass production was achieved at
spacing of 70 � 70 cm. Essential oil yield was 0.3% in branches
and 4.0% in leaves; safrole content was not evaluated.<a name="disease"></a></p>

<h3>Disease Susceptibility</h3>

<p>In the early 1960s, Japanese immigrants to Brazil colonized
the state of Par�, and initiated the culture of black-pepper (<i>Piper
nigrum</i> L.) but it was an agronomic and economical disaster,
due to fusarium disease caused by<i> Fusarium solani</i> f. sp. <i>piperis</i>.
Poltronieri et al. (1997) evaluated the resistance of seedlings
of <i>P. hispidinervum</i> to different isolates of this
pathogen, and demonstrated resistance, indicating the possibility
of commercial cropping in areas where black pepper had been
decimated by the fusarium disease.</p>

<p><i>Cercospora</i> is a potential pathogen of <i>P.
hispidinervum</i>. In Xapuri (Acre state), plants infected by <i>Cercospora</i>
had a reduction of 21% in essential oil produced, but the safrole
content was unaffected (Siviero and Pimentel 1997).<a name="future"></a></p>

<h2>FUTURE PROSPECTS</h2>

<p>Forest preservation in developing countries is a controversial
issue that involves many different interests. The worldwide
demand for raw materials, such as safrole, offers an opportunity
to these countries that have a source of products in their
natural forests. </p>

<p>Forest preservation is best linked to local populations
maintenance. In this context, <i>P. hispidinervum</i> is more
than a new safrole source. The economical exploration of its
productive potential could be an important step to assist in the
maintenance of the Amazon rainforest, providing a new livelihood
option. This might include culture as a crop but also sustainable
management in natural vegetation, since this species occurs in
high populations in several open areas such as in natural gaps in
the forest and in areas bordering the primary rainforest. An
integrated project based on this species among research
institutes, universities, governmental, and non-governmental
institutions could produce a sustainable alternative crop for the
tropical rainforest. <a name="references"></a></p>
