<h2>Synthesis of 2-Amino-1-Phenyl-1-Propanol and its Methylated Derivatives</h2>
<h4>By F. W. Hoover &amp; H. B. Hass, J. Org. Chem. 506-509 (1947)</h4>

  <p>Ephedrine is obtained commercially not only from extraction of the herb <em>Ma 
    Huang</em> but also by a synthetic process<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> 
    in which <em>l</em>-1-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-propanone obtained by action of benzaldehyde 
    on fermenting sugar solutions, is allowed to react with methylamine, and the 
    resulting Schiff base is reduced to <em>l</em>-ephedrine. This process has 
    the advantage that no resolution is necessary. Propadrine hydrochloride, also 
    called Mydriatine, is a racemic mixture, melting at 190-194�C. It is a mydriatic, 
    diaphoretic, vasoconstrictor, and is used like ephedrine hydrochloride or 
    ephedrine sulfate but its action is more prolonged. In 1929, Nagai and Kanao<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 
    reported the synthesis of ephedrine from benzaldehyde and nitroethane. A similar 
    series of reactions has been used in this work and offers a route to ephedrine.</p>

  </ol>

  <p>The nitro alcohol was obtained in good yield by the method of Vanderbilt 
    and Hass<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, Kamlet<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
    and Nagai and Kanao<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, but the method of Kamlet 
    is particularly desirable because of the speed of the reaction. This method 
    involves reaction between nitroethane and the sodium bisulfite addition product 
    of benzaldehyde. It requires only a few hours whereas the other methods require 
    several days.</p>

<p>The unmethylated amino alcohol was obtained by reduction of the nitro alcohol either with zinc and sulfuric acid, tin and hydrochloric acid, sodium amalgam and acetic
acid, or by catalytic hydrogenation. Presumably many of the ordinary metal-acid reducing agents can be used provided the temperature is kept sufficiently low to prevent
dehydration. There are, however, several byproducts of the reduction. When catalytic hydrogenation was selected as the method, N-ethylbenzylamine was a by-product. It
presumably forms by the following reactions:</p>

    <li><span class="oli">PhCH(OH)CH(NO<sub>2</sub>)CH<sub>3</sub> <img src="pictures/arrows/dblarrow.gif"> PhCHO +

  </ol>

<p>This series of reactions postulates the formation of benzaldehyde and nitroethane by decomposition of 2-nitro-1-phenyl-1-propanol. It seemed logical to assume that
this reaction was brought about by the catalytic effect of the basic (amine) reduction products. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that use of carbon dioxide in
the Parr bomb reduces the yield of N-ethylbenzylamine to negligible quantities. Of those tested, the two best methods of reduction, from the standpoint of both simplicity
and yield, are that using zinc and sulfuric acid, and that using acetic acid and sodium amalgam.</p>

  <p>The amino alcohol which is an intermediate in the formation of Propadrine 
    is easily methylated by adding an equimolecular amount of aqueous formaldehyde 
    and then reducing catalytically. Each step in the synthesis provides good 
    yields. Efforts to separate the diastereoisomers were much less satisfactory. 
    The method of Nagai and Kanao<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> for resolving 
    the hydrochloride of 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol, using absolute ethanol as 
    the solvent, proved very inefficient, although enough of the desired diastereoisomer, 
    dl-norephedrine hydrochloride, was obtained for identification. The pressor 
    action of these four stereoisomers has been studied by Jarowski and Hartung<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Preparation of 2-nitro-1-phenyl-1-propanol</h4>

    <p><strong>(a)</strong> Method of Vanderbilt and Hass<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Benzaldehyde (13.25 g, 0.125 mole), nitroethane (9.38g, 0.125 mole), and 50 mL of 95% ethanol were mixed, and 2 mL of sodium hydroxide (25% solution) was added with
cooling. After allowing the mixture to stand for four days, the sodium hydroxide was neutralized and most of the alcohol was removed under reduced pressure. The residue
was dissolved in ether, extracted with sodium bisulfite solution to remove unreacted benzaldehyde, and then distilled (bp 120-130�C/2-4 mmHg) conversion 28g (62%). based
on the benzaldehyde that reacted, the yield was almost quantitative.</p>

    <p><strong>(b)</strong> Method of Nagai and Kanao<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Benzaldehyde (106g, 1 mole), nitroethane (75g, 1 mole), and 50 mL of saturated 
      sodium bicarbonate solution were vigorously stirred for one week at room 
      temperature (25-30�C). The organic and aqueous layers were separated, the 
      organic layer was washed with sodium bisulfite solution and distilled (bp 
      120-130�C/2-4 mmHg), 90.5 g resulted, conversion 50%, yield, based on benzaldehyde 
      which reacted, 90%.</p>

    <p><strong>(c)</strong> Method of Kamlet<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Benzaldehyde (106 g, 1 mole) was vigorously agitated with sodium bisulfite (110 g, 1.06 mole) in 500 mL of water until the formation of the addition compound was
complete. Simultaneously, nitroethane (82.5 g, 1.10 mole) was dissolved in a solution made from sodium hydroxide (45 g, 1.125 moles) dissolved in 200 ml. of water. This
solution was gradually added, with agitation and at room temperature, to the addition product of benzaldehyde and sodium bisulfite. After stirring for a half hour, the
mixture was allowed to stand overnight. The lower layer was discarded and the upper layer was dissolved in ether and washed with sodium bisulfite solution. The ethereal
solution was dried over Drierite, and after removal of ether, distilled (bp 120-130�C/2-4 mmHg) The usual conversion is 90-100g (50-55%) and the yield, based on
benzaldehyde which reacts, is nearly quantitative.</p>

<h4>Preparation of 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol</h4>

    <p><strong>(a)</strong> With zinc and sulfuric acid</p>

<p>Sulfuric acid (375 g. of 30% acid) was added with stirring to a mixture of 2-nitro-1-phenyl-1-propanol (54.3 g, 0.3 mole), zinc dust (90 g, 1.37 mole of 80 mesh zinc),
and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol. The acid was added at such a rate that the temperature remained at 45�C or below. Usually 10 to 12 hours were required. Agitation was
continued for 1-2 hours after completing the addition of acid, then after extracting the acidic solution with ether to remove non-basic materials, a large excess of
sodium hydroxide (as 50% solution) was added. The product which was freed was extracted with ether. Three extractions, with a total of 500 ml. of ether, sufficed. The
ether solution was dried, ether was removed, and the product was distilled (bp 122�C/4-5mmHg); 29-32 g resulted (yield 65 to 70%). The viscous liquid solidified on
standing, and had amp of 46-50�C.</p>

    <p><strong>(b)</strong> With sodium amalgam and acetic acid</p>

<p>Glacial acetic acid (160 g., 2.66 moles) and 3% sodium amalgam (1924 g., 2.5 moles) were added in small portions and with good agitation to a solution of 2-nitro-1-
phenyl-1-propanol (36.2 g, 0.2 mole) in 300 mL of absolute alcohol. Acetic acid was introduced at a rate sufficient to maintain an acidic reaction. The rate of adding the
amalgam was such that the temperature was maintained at 45�C or less. At the end of the reaction mercury was separated, water was added to dissolve the sodium acetate,
and the mixture was heated to remove the alcohol and concentrate the solution. The cooled solution was extracted with ether to remove non-basic material and then treated
with excess sodium hydroxide (as 50% solution), and the product was taken up in ether. After removing the ether and distilling, 18-21g of product resulted (bp 112�C/2-
3mmHg).</p>

    <p><strong>(c)</strong> Catalytic hydrogenation</p>

<p>A mixture of 2-nitro-1-phenyl-1-propanol (36.2 g, 0.2 mole), 100 mL of absolute alcohol, and 4 g of Raney nickel was placed in a Parr hydrogenation bomb. Sufficient solid
carbon dioxide was added to produce a pressure of 300 psi, then hydrogen was introduced to bring the total initial pressure to 1800 psi. Approximately four hours was
required for complete reduction. On distilling, N-ethylbenzylamine (5%) and 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol (87%) were obtained. When no carbon dioxide was used, the yield of
N-ethylbenzylamine approximated 45%.</p>

<p>N-ethylbenzylamine was identified by its boiling point (198�C) and the melting point of the hydrochloride (184�C) compared with an authentic sample prepared from
benzaldehyde and ethylamine.</p>

<h4>Identification of 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol</h4>

</div>

    <p>The product was a very viscous, colorless liquid which solidified on standing, 
      mp 46-50�C. When dry hydrogen chloride was passed into an ether solution, 
      a gelatinous precipitate resulted, which hardened on standing. This character 
      of precipitate was attributed to the rather complex mixture of isomers, 
      since an authentic sample of <em>l</em>-ephedrine yielded well formed crystals. 
      A better product could be made from the base by treating it with concentrated 
      hydrochloric acid to the end point of methyl red indicator, evaporating 
      under reduced pressure, and recrystallizing from butanol-ether (50:50 v/v). 
      The white crystals (mp 134-137�C) gave 18.87 and 18.89% chlorine by Fajan's 
      method (theory 18.91%). The neutral equivalent of the free amine was 155 
      (theory 151). The material is therefore believed to be a mixture of dl-norephedrine 
      and dl-norisoephedrine. These two compounds are diastereoisomers and the physical 
	  constants can be read in the table.</p>

<p>After four fractional crystallizations from absolute alcohol it was possible to obtain a hydrochloride mp 192�C. The melting point of a mixture of this compound and norephedrine hydrochloride was 192�C. Thus, it is possible to separate the components of the mixture by fractional crystallization but the yield is low. The method of Nagai and Kanao<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>, which utilizes the greater solubility in ether of norisoephedrine to separate the isomers, was tried on the free base. After four crystallizations, the amino alcohol melted at 72-75�C. Since the original base mixture melted at 46-50�C, the difference in solubility is evidently not great.</p>

    <p>The mixture of stereoisomers obtained in this synthesis was tested for physiological 
      action by two manufacturers of pharmaceuticals who compared it with norephedrine 
      hydrochloride and found it to have a similar effect on the blood pressure. 
      The work of Jarowski and Hartung already has been mentioned<a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<h4>Preparation of 2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol</h4>

    <p>Formaldehyde (0.3 mole of active material as 37% solution) was added, with 
      cooling, to 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol (45.3g, 0.3 mole) dissolved in ethanol. 
      After the mixture had stood for a half hour, the Schiff base was reduced 
      in a Parr hydrogenation bomb. Raney nickel (4 g) was used as a catalyst. 
      Initial pressures of hydrogen from 600-1400 psi. were suitable. The product 
      was recovered by distilling the alcoholic solution with a Podbielniak column. 
      There was a small amount of material which boiled at 106�C/5mmHg, but the 
      main portion of the distillate was collected at 115-120�C/5mmHg. The yield 
      of the more high-boiling product was 40g (81%).</p>

<p>This mixture presumably is norephedrine and norisoephedrine and their monomethylated derivatives. This type of alkylation usually results in the formation of primary,
secondary, and tertiary amines. Knowing that they usually result in such mixtures, we assume that small amounts are present in spite of the good agreement of the
percentage of nitrogen with that required for C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO. Samples of this material were prepared for several laboratories which specialize in techniques for separating
isomers, but as yet no satisfactory process has been devised.</p>

</div>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The synthesis of 2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol and of 2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol has been effected in several ways, all utilizing economical intermediates as
initial materials. The mixture of diastereoisomers can be obtained in good yield but the methods for separating the isomers are not yet entirely satisfactory.</p>
