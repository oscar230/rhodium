<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>(-)-&alpha;-Methylhydrocinnamic acid (<strong>I</strong>), prepared by resolution with (+)-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine, was converted to optically
pure (-)-Amphetamine (<strong>II</strong>). An analogous series of reactions was carried out to form 3,4-dimethoxy-amphetamine.</p>

</div>

<p>A vigorously stirred suspension of 9.1 g of sodium hydride in 125 ml. of methyl propionate was cooled in ice and treated with 
0.45 ml of absolute ethanol, then with 31.84 g of benzaldehyde in 50 ml of methyl propionate during 10 min. The ice bath was 
removed after one hour, replaced as soon as the vigorous reaction started, then removed again, and stirring was continued for another 
2 hr. The organic layer was separated, after cautious addition of 28 ml. of acetic acid, then of 100 ml. of water, and the aqueous 
phase extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined ester solutions were washed with <i>N</i> hydrochloric acid and with sodium chloride 
solution, dried with sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuo. The residual ester was refluxed with 33.6 g. of potassium hydroxide in 
60 ml. of water and 240 ml. of methanol for one hour. The solution was concentrated, diluted with water to <i>ca</i>. 500 ml., 
acidified with 6 <i>N</i> hydrochloric acid, chilled overnight, and the collected solid was washed with ice water; yield 35.67 g.
(73%), m.p. 75-81�C'. The acid crystallized from hexane in colorless prisms, m.p. 80.5-81.0�C (lit<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> m.p. 81-82�C).</p>

<p><strong>3,4-Dimethoxy-&alpha;-methylcinnamic acid</strong></p>

<p>The combined ester solutions, obtained from 18.53 g. of sodium hydride, 101.7 g. of veratraldehyde, and 356 ml. of methyl propionate, 
were washed with <i> N</i> hydrochloric acid, extracted with aqueous potassium carbonate, dried over potassium carbonate, concentrated, 
and passed through an alumina column which was then washed with chloroform. Evaporation of the eluates and crystallization from 
ether-hexane yielded 115.0 g. (80%) of the methyl ester as colorless prisms, m.p. 62.5-64.5�C (lit.<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a> m.p. 65-67�C). The 
free acid was obtained in 99% yield by saponifying this ester with 2 molar equivalents of potassium hydroxide. It formed colorless 
needles, m.p. 142.8-143.8�C (lit. m.p. 142-143�C<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>,144�C<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>). Additional acid, isolated by acidifying the potassium 
carbonate extract and by saponifying the evaporated mother liquors of the recrystallized ester, was purified by crystallization from 
ethanol, raising the total yield from veratraldehyde to 86%.</p>

<p><strong>DL-&alpha;-Methylhydrocinnamic acid (<i>I</i>)</strong></p>

<p>DL-&alpha;-Methylhydrocinnamic acid was prepared in 95% yield by treating 30 g. of &alpha;-methylcinnamic acid and 99.8 g.of sodium 
hydroxide in 900 ml. of water with 90 g. of Raney nickel-aluminum alloy at 90�C<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a>. The cooled filtrate and washings were 
stirred into 720 ml. of concd. hydrochloric acid and about 700 g. of ice and extracted with ether (600 + 300 + 300ml). The ether 
extracts were washed with 2 <i>N</i> hydrochloric acid and with sodium chloride solution, dried, and evaporated. The distilled acid 
(b.p. 148-149�C/9 mm.,116.5�C/0.5 mm.) solidified on chilling; m.p. 36-37�C; yield 28.9 g. (95%). A sample crystallized from pentane 
in colorless prisms, m.p. 36.6-37.5�C (lit.<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>13</sup></a> m.p. 37�C).</p>

<p><strong>DL-3,4-Dimethoxy-&alpha;-methylhydrocinnamic acid (<i>IV</i>)</strong></p>

<p>DL-3,4-Dimethoxy-&alpha;-methylhydrocinnamic acid was obtained in 94% yield as colorless hexagonal plates, mp 61.5-62.8�C 
(lit.<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>14</sup></a> m.p. 58-59�C), after evaporating the ether extracts and recrystalizing the residue from ether-pentane.</p>

<p><strong>L-(+)-&alpha;-Methylhydrocinnamic acid</strong><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>A cold solution of 41.0 g of racemic <i>I</i> in 350 ml. of ethyl acetate was treated with 30.25 g. of (-)-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine 
(<i>III</i>)<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>, heated to dissolve the precipitate, and allowed to cool slowly. The solid was recrystallized six times from 
ethyl acetate to yield 16.1 g. of the (+)-<i>I</i>-( -)-<i>III</i> salt as long colorless needles, m.p. 127-129.5, [&alpha;]20/D 
-1.48" (c 2.00, chloroform). Systematic recrystallization of the second crops gave another 1.8 g. of pure salt, bringing the total 
yield to 50%.</p>

<p>The free acid was obtained in 95% yield by shaking the salt with ether and excess 2 <i> N</i> sulfuric acid and extracting the aqueous 
phase31 with additional ether. The extracts were washed four times each with 2 Ar sulfuric acid and with sodium chloride solution, 
dried, and evaporated. Distillation gave (+)-<i>I</i>, b.p. 112�C/0.25 mm.</p>

<p><strong>D-(-)-&alpha;-Methylhydrocinnamic acid</strong><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The impure (-)-<i>I</i>, recovered from the mother liquors of the (+)-<i>I</i>-( -)-<i>III</i> salt and treated with 
(+)-<i>III</i><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>, yielded 51% of the (-)-<i>I</i>-(+)-<i>III</i> salt, m.p. 127.3-129.5�C, which was also prepared from 
racemic <i>I</i> (after 10 recrystallizations: m.p. 128-130�C). The free acid had b.p. 111�C/0.22 mm.</p>

<p><strong>L-(+)-3,4-Dimethoxy-&alpha;-methylhydrocinnamic acid</strong><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The quinine salt was prepared from 96.7 g. of racemic <i>IV</i> and 140 g. of quinine in about 1800 ml. of ethanol and recrystallized 
thrice from the same solvent. It formed electrified needles, m.p. 163.7-164.3�.  The yield, including pure material isolated from the 
mother liquors, was 90%.</p>

<p>The free acid was isolated in the same way as (+)- <i>I</i>; evaporation of the ethereal solution gave a viscous oil which, dried in 
a high vacuum, was used directly for further reactions. A sample was distilled in a bulb tube: b.p. 130�C (bath temperature)/0.01 mm. 
The acid chloride, prepared from 1 g. of the acid with 1.15 ml. of oxalyl chloride in 97% yield, had b.p. 90�C (bath temperature)/0.015 
mm. The amide was obtained from the acid chloride with concentrated aqueous ammonia; it crystallized from water in colorless needles, m.p. 121.5-122.5�C.</p>

<p><strong>D-(-)-3,4-Dimethoxy-&alpha;-methylhydrocinnamic acid</strong><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Treating the impure (-)-<i>IV</i>, recovered from the quinine salt mother liquors, with (-)-<i>III</i> afforded the 
(-)-<i>IV</i>-( -)-<i>III</i> salt in 77% yield, based on the racemic <i>IV</i> used originally. The major portion was obtained 
pure after three recrystallizations from ethyl acetate; m.p. 107-109.3�C. The free acid had b.p. 120�C (bath temperature)/0.00. m.  
The acid chloride had b.p. 95�C (bath temperature)/0.01mm.</p>

<p><strong>D-(-)-&alpha;-Methylphenethylamine (<i>II</i>)</strong><a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><i>(<strong>a</strong>) By the Curtius Rearrangement</i>. (-)-<i>I</i> (5.35 g.) was refluxed with 8.4 ml. of oxalyl chloride for one hour, and the 
solution evaporated in vacuo<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a> and re-evaporated twice after adding dry benzene. The acid chloride, dissolved in 22 ml. 
of dry acetone, was added rapidly a  -10�C  to a magnetically stirred solution of 4.38 g. of sodium azide in 13 ml. of water. The 
mixture was stirred at 3�C for 1 hr. and extracted twice with a total of 37 ml. of benzene; the extracts were washed with sodium 
chloride solution, dried rapidly with sodium sulfate, filtered, and the residue was washed with another 15 ml. of benzene. The 
filtrate was concentrated at room temperature in vacuo<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a> to about 1/2 of its volume, brought to about its original volume 
with dry benzene, heated to 62�C over 15 min. in the presence of a piece of Teflon (which seemed to promote nitrogen evolution), kept 
at this temperature for 1 hr., and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was warmed with 17.5 ml. of concd. hydrochloric acid at 45�C for 
5 min., diluted with water, and the solution extracted once with ether to remove a slight opalescence. It was then treated with excess 
10 <i>N</i> sodium hydroxide and extracted twice with ether. The extracts were washed with 10 <i>N</i> sodium hydroxide, dried with 
powdered sodium hydroxide, filtered, treated with 8 ml. of 5 <i>N</i> ethanolic hydrogen chloride, and evaporated to dryness. The 
residual ( - )-<i>II</i> hydrochloride was washed with ether and dried; yield 5.06 g. (90.5%), m.p. 155.7-156.7�C<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>. The 
neutral sulfate was obtained by treating the hydrochloride with 5 <i>N</i> sodium hydroxide, extracting the amine with benzene, and 
adding one equivalent of ethanolic sulfuric acid. It crystallized from water-ethanol-acetone in colorless leaflets<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>

<p><i>(<strong>b</strong>) By the Schmidt rearrangement</i>. A well-stirred solution of 7.02 g. of (-)-<strong>I</strong> in 50 ml of chloroform was treated with 
13 ml. of concd. sulfuric acid, then at 45�C with 3.62 g. of sodium azide over 0.5 hr<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></.   Stirring at 45�C was continued 
during 0.5 hr., and the mixture was worked up as under (<strong>a</strong>). The hydrochloride (yield 6.18 g., 84%) crystallized from 
ethanol-ether in colorless prisms, m.p. 153-155�C<a href="alpha-methylhydrocinnamic.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></.   The neutral sulfate had m.p. 328-329�C (decompn. and darkening).</p>
