please reveal your source of Vicks Inhalers, that way all this SPAM about
MethSynth will become 'academic' if you'll pardon the expression

So please mail all your d-meth to ME !

I'll trade ya gram for gram

thank GOD for small favors

YFOAF is mistaken

which yields about 10% of mutant ephedrine salt that'll give you a special
sort of speed Buzz you wish would go away

well actually a Parr Hydrogenation Flask is a simple matter, it's the
fuckin' apparatus that'll set you back 3 Grand

make that 'careful improvisation'

None of these will make a difference, nor can you PETITION the Lord with

It was somewhat entertaining, and you're a good guesser, you just happened
to get every fucking detail WRONG this time.... but hang in there.

All you guys that've been hangin' around here for years,  once more, PLEASE
excuse the redundancy of the repetitious redundancy again, once more,
again. There HAS to be someone who hangs out here that has a job.... how
about a small WebSite donation for a FAQ or an Archive or somethin'...

  neither Raney Nickel or Pd/C will  work
  correct catalyst is Pd on BaSO4
  Perchloric acid, not Sulfuric acid
  hydrogenation temperature is 80-90C,
  either the l-eph HCl or the p-fed HCl may be used



 In a pressure vessel, dissolve 100g ephedrine in 1 L glacial acetic acid,
then add:
        5 g of Pd on BaSO4 premoistened with the solvent
        40mL of 70% perchloric acid

Seal the vessel, flush with H2, heat blanket and shake at 80-90 C until H2
is no longer taken up (10-30min).

Filter off the catalyst, precipitate the perchloric acid as the potassium
salt with KOH soln.

Evaporate the acetic acid under vaccuum.

Take up the residue in water, make basic (~pH 11-12) with either KOH or
NaOH soln,
extract with ether (3x 100 mL), dry over MgSO4, bubble dry HCl through the
dried ether and collect the precipitate. Yields 80-90% where modern
hydrogenation practices are applied.


Who says so?

According to Hartung and Simonoff in chapter 5 of  "Organic Reactions"
the article is entitled "Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Groups Attached to
Oxygen, Nitrogen, or Sulfur", pp 263-326; "Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl
Groups"],
  "The hydrochlorides of arylalpha-aminoalkyl ketones are reduced only to
the amino alcohol when paladium catalyst is employed; however, if the amino
ketone or the amino alcohol is hydrogenated in acetic acid at 80-90 C with
palladium on barium sulfate in the presence of perchloric acid, excellent
yields of the desoxy compound are obtained. It is suggested that in the
presence of perchloric acid the reduction proceeds through the acetic acid
ester of the amino alcohol." They reference Rosenmund and Karg, Ber.,
(Berichte Chemische), v 75, p 1850, 1942.

the right hand Man sez:

Presumably the reduction past the alcohol stage using the Pd/C method is
hindered due to steric effects and/or activity of the catalyst. It is my
guess that the reaction actually proceeds through an (-OH2)+ intermediate
formed by protonation via the perchloric acid, which is then displaced on
the catalyst surface by a hydrogen radical.

Anyway, yields of 80% of the desoxyephedrine at 80-90 C using the
Pd/BaSO4 in CH3COOH with HClO4 under 1 atm H2 is complete in about 30-45
minutes, with yields of the desired isomer of 75-85%. Higher yields
are achieved starting with ephedrine, but the pseudo still yields typically
75-80% d-meth.
