Subject: Dildo's and SepFunnels


Patience is a virtue in chemistry and life BUT when you find yourself
gnawing on the skulls of your incarcerated ancestors in a rented crank oil
stinking garage space, waiting for the colloidal suspensions, or the
troublesome undocumented third middle layer to debubblfy...patience may not
be all that practical.

I have found that if you trim the head of a latex, plug in dildo to replace
the stopper on your sep funnel and give it the old VIBE, it will speed the
seperation as well as the breaking up of aforementioned sludgelayers, and
save you some time. Don't use some sort of mega-pussy eyeball shaker,
designed for the elite-frigid class..you don't want to get into the area of
agitation or orgasmic chemistry, just aid settling.  Experiment a bit and
I think you may find this "TIP" useful.
