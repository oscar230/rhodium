How could this be for ANYTHING but informational purposes only...? it's
TEXT for Bobsakes!!!! ....Jeez, you can't even wipe your ass with it unless
you print it out!  And I don't think 'informational' is actually a word, by
the way... outside the jargonary netSpeak practication of redundamental
disclaimerism, that is.
  Even if I DID advocate breaking some criminal code that is probably
illegal in itself, whaddaya gonna do?  Blame ME.. or fuckin' Heavy Metal,
or TeleVision, DRUGS???!!!...get a GRIP!!!                Just...
jus...    don'tGetMeFuckinStarted OKAY!!!

                          A Public Service Announcement
... you've checked your phones for wiretaps, scanned the walls for
transmitters, no surprises there. Dangerous stimulants have run low and
your motivation is waning... you've ingested an experimental psychedelic in
an attempt to make sense of the MediaSpew, a relaxing evening in front of
the TV, a large bore handgun within reach, though... just in case the
electronic bastard decides to turn on you... a quivering elvis runs up your
spine and strange familiar creatures snicker in your peripheries.
        Anything is better than facing the silence which would bear
contemplation of the Konspiracy's next move... better not to think of it.
        A fat whore spits and raves on the tube, bitching that her drug
dealing brother is fucking all her dykeFriend's roomates in a tossUp,
crack'n'hump frenzy, and she has once again sunk to the level
of....whatever... at last... totally useless information... ranting, empty
BullShit... damn near entertaining with the dragonFace hallucinations and
chemicalGraphics..
        THEN...it seems... your entire world has ripped open!  In fact,
your entire world HAS ripped open!  At least the living room wall part...
horror flails at the realization: "It's Not The Drugs!"  An authentic,
realTime, threeDimensional tractor trailer has actually crashed into your
house. A fuming, caustic chemical tanker no less....COINCIDENCE?    I
hardly think so...yet, the Konspiracy's use of massive vehicular strike
systems for residential attacks on Resistance or InterZone agents shall be
the topic of another posting, published in a TopSecret NETdomain. Our
focus shall be Public Safety, not Politiconspintrigue.
        Of course, the immediate concern is our own safety and the safety
of our neighbors... first of all, we must identify the hideous chemical
leaking from the tanker truck into a glass jug which we have placed in our
living room for just such an eventuality.  Gas chromatography,
spectrogrammatical assays, and so on may be great for impressing the
girls/boys... but such measures are entirely unnecessary. Any Tank Truck
or RailRoad Tank car carrying hazardous chemicals display a diamond shaped
placard with a DOT code number identifying the chemical cargo. This is so
Private Conspiracy or Government Strike Forces, the dreaded 'Emergency
Response Teams' can assure that the proper chemical weapon has been
adequately deployed on the target area.
        At great risk, I am quietly distributing these secret codes to
selected Internet Agents.
        These codes have been transcribed from microfilm taken from the
TopSecret Document entitled: 1993 Emergency Response Guidebook, Second
Printing, printed by the US Dept. of Transportation, Research and Special
Programs Administration.
        A Bell-Tell communication device may be employed by talented
InterZone Agents who wish to obtain their own classified version of this
document.... the secret government access code is 1-800-PLANFOR or
(1-800-367-9592 in Illinois) to reach Hazardous Materials Information
Exchange

It is your DUTY as a citizen to keep the enviornment SAFE. If you see any
of these substances spilling or leaking in any of the tens of thousands of
RailRoad Depots or Truck Stops accross the nation, make sure you use a
sealable glass container, or where appropriate, a stainless Steel pressure
vessel to adequately contain the spill!
