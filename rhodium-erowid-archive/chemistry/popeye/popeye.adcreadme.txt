Subject:      we could even call it README! (from POPi)

There are folks who may browse Our Lady Internet for fun or curiousity...
And more of them have an interest in psychoactive recreation than the
PinkBoys and poweRangers would have us believe.
As the Net expands, more lurkers slip quietly in, and occasionally one may
have an inquiry.
And we often flame them mercilessly.

WHY?

There are a number of reasons:

1. Because we are a selfRighteous, arrogant bunch. This can easily be
explained. The majority of us at ADC are Amerikan males. That's just the
way it is, and if you don't like it, Fuck You.  If you think we're bad,
check out the dittoBoys at alt.limbaugh.worship.

2. They deserve it.
Totally stoopid questions draw incendiary acsii. Welcome to the InterNet.

3. Not everybody is aware of the fact that we live in a policeState, under
a New Improved Interactive Consitution, that freedom of speech and privacy
are now passe', and in light of this new Telecommisseration Axe,  answering
certain questions in particular ways could get one or more in a LOT of
trouble, felonious even. The fact that many are ignorant of such things
may be tragic, but not necessarily their fault... the Amerikan propaganda
and SPAM machine is pretty heavyDuty after all, especially if you were
brought up on regular doses of the television drug.

It is to the third variation that I wish to address this post, and suggest
we  lay out some guidelines to faciliate continuation of the free flow of
informayshun through/from this group, lest we become twisted, clannish and
inbred. And it is to the casual observer, lurkers and Newbies that I wish
to speak... They CAN get their questions answered around here, if they are
polite and know how to ask, I am suggesting we show them how to ask up
front.
I would like to hone this thread into a streamlined cohesive set of
no-brainer guidelines and  post it consistently and consecutively so that
we don't have to keep explaining the same limitations over and over. After
all,  it is usually just a matter of syntax, and most onLine folks, outside
of AOL, are at least marginally familiar with the concept of syntax or they
wouldn't have gotten this far.

I'm going to Emale this around prior to posting, but it would be most fun,
I think, to carry on the discussion here on USENET.

This is NOT a FAQ, rather instructions on how to use ADC as the legitimate
resource that it is, despite the scorn of tight-asses and old-fashioned
Federalists,  Tories, and powerFreaks.

By the authority vested in me by the
        Interational Drug Psychosium,
        Napoleonic Council for Democratic Delusions and
        Dept of Auditory Hallucinations...
                I pronounce myself as the allPowerful keeper of ADC law for
as long as my attention does not deficit nor disorder, or until somebody
else wants to do it.


Why Bother?


1. You never know who is going to stop by. Imagine someone like Repke,
Hoffman or Shulgin comes browsing through,  and happens to catch us at our
most irritated worst, acting like a bunch of confrontational, boorish,
Yoginacious, counterClockwise glorps.... they're going to keep on going,
and I wouldn't blame them.
2. It is the righteous thing to do, and will help us distinguish between
simply uninformed Newbies,and those who will never learn, can't read, are
open season, OR any possible heat source, who should then appear obvious by
their very use of entrapping language we have begged against.
3. Preserve bandwidth and redundancy, prevent corporal tunnel syndrome,etc.
4. Perhaps deter morons trying to make drug deals
5. Because unfortunately, I STILL don't have a life.


This is something I have come up with to roll the ball starting. PLEASE
give me some feedback if there is anything anyone might find objectionable
or any improvements, additions, clarifications, the whole idea sucks, why
don't you crawl back under your Norton and catch oil drops in your teeth,
motorcycle punk, etc.etc.. speak OUT!

FORMULATING QUESTIONS TO THE ADC NEWSGROUP...
SYNTAX,ETTIQUETTE,APPROACH,GUIDELINES,PROHIBITIONS and pretty good advice
.............................................................................

State the question in a recognizable form:

                        *WRONG*
>My friend got ahold of what is supposed to be MDMA, only it's Brown !

                        *RIGHT*
Could someone please tell me what color MDMA should be?  Can it be brown
and still be OK? If the brown is from impurities, can it be dangerous?
Thanks a head of time,
-Jenk Jefferies
.............................................................................

Be somewhat specific:

                         *WRONG*
>Does anybody know how to make speed ?

                         *RIGHT*
I am interested in learning about the synthesis of methamphetamine, can
anyone suggest a good starting point. I have taken one chemistry class at
community college. Good books? Net sites? library material?
        Thank you very much,
-DBrown3@aol.mre
.............................................................................

But not too specific,

                         *WRONG*
>Can someone tell me where to buy Palladium?

NOTE: This sounds like someone asking for the name of a store or mail
location. That sort of information is rarely distributed at ADC and never
on request. This group is WATCHED. Recommending a righteous business to
an unknown individual is a can of worms at least, does no favors, and is
downright unethical.

                         *RIGHT*
Does anyone know of an OTC product from which I may be able to obtain
palladium? Can it be obtained from chemical supply houses or elsewhere
without gov't paperwork or scrutiny?  Would appreciate any ideas on this.

.............................................................................

Be polite and reasonable:

                        *WRONG*
>What does synthesize mean, could you be more specific, why don't you just
>friggin' tell us how to do it... you guys are FUCKED, MAN !!!!

                        *RIGHT*
If someone could perhaps recommend a good beginner's organic chemistry book
with  an emphasis on pharmacology,  I would forever be their humble
servant.

NOTE: If you think shameless flattery or hi-Vac, suckAss, brown-nosing will
get your questions answered and your archive decorated, you are absolutely
right. These messages/articles/posts are generated by human beings.
............................................................................
.

All questions concerning the synthesis of drugs which are currently
illegal, must be phrased so that they are totally devoid of INTENT or
ACTION. This is VERY important and violations never get anywhere. I
repeat, this group is WATCHED!  We all know that, now you do, too.

                        *WRONG*
>I'm trying to synthesize mescaline and wondering if someone could help me with
>some information.
                        *WRONG*
>Can somebody tell me why our P2P/ Methylamine reaction just blew up in our
>face?

                        *RIGHT*
I am interested in information about the synthesis of [DoC],  here is some
of the data I have gathered on the subject to date. Appreciate any info on
procedures, precursers...but will settle for references.
-mdBurr@nick.tea.net

NOTE: the above example also illustrates the willingness of the inquiring
party to CONTRIBUTE information to the group, accurately or not, this is
hands down, the best way to spark a constructive and educational dialog at
ADC, and `extract' essential information, for obvious reasons... this is a
discussion group, not an ftp site. But be warned that flagrant trolls are
usually flamed or ignored. Flame bait is  ALWAYS ignored, and we take
pride in that.
............................................................................
We guaranty that ANY attempts at illicit drug trafficking/bartering or
chemical exchanges will be promptly and thoroughly flamed. Maybe there ARE
places on the NET where people are stoopid enough to indulge in this
jailBound activity, but the levels of intelligence and  self-actualized
paranoia at ADC are far and above anything that would permit suicidal
commercialism. Insulting our intelligence yields predictable results.
............................................................................
It is safe to say that all of the above applies in personal Emales to ADC
regulars, PGP or not.
............................................................................
.
The above guidelines are for good reason and some are necessary to the
survival of our group into the ominous future, which looms over the
crossroad of democratic traditions and the reality of contemporary
authoritarianism. They are not restrictive, they are for your protection
and ours, and simply indicate a type of language we ask you to employ. If
you share our interests and are willing to suffer these minor quirks along
with us, we think you will find ADC a friendly, informative and fun group
that welcomes enthusiastic newbies and casual browsers with good humor and
respect (except where mutually exclusive).

Thank you for taking the time to read this
