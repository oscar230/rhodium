<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>A new plausible synthetic pathway for the synthesis of the peyote alkaloid mescaline in a satisfactory overall yield is reported.</p>
</div>
		  
        <p>The hallucinogen mescaline (<strong>I</strong>) is the main alkaloid isolated
          from the cactus plant <em>Anhalonium Lewinii Hennings</em> or <em>Lophophora Williamsii
          Lemaire</em><a href="mescaline.mannich.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. Several methods have been reported describing the total
          synthesis of this alkaloid<a href="mescaline.mannich.html#refs"><sup>2-7</sup></a>. However, all these procedures were
          found to be tedious and costly as well as giving low overall yields
          of the alkaloid. In the present work, we would like to report a convenient
          new simple, facile and non-costly synthetic pathway of mescaline (<strong>I</strong>)
          leading to comparatively high overall yields. The scheme illustrates
          the route resorted to to achieve the base, starting from the inexpensive
          and easily available 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (<strong>II</strong>).</p>
        <p><strong>II</strong> was allowed to undergo
            Mannich reaction to give the base <strong>III</strong>. Subsequent quaternization to <strong>IV</strong>, nucleophilic substitution to <strong>V</strong> and methylation resulted in 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl
            cyanide (<strong>VI</strong>) in high yields. Lithium aluminum hydride reduction of the
            latter afforded the alkaloid mescaline isolated as the hydrochloride
            in 42% overall yield.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>
        <p>Melting points were determined on a Kofler melting point
          apparatus and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer
          Model 257 grating spectrophotometer and were consistent with the assigned
          structures. Microanalyses were performed at the National Research Centre,
          Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. Analytical results obtained were within +-0.4%
          of the calculated value.</p>
        <p><strong>4-Dimethylaminomethyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol</strong> (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
        <p>To a solution of 23.1 g (0.15 mol) of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
          (<strong>II</strong>) in 150 ml of methanol was added 17.1 g of 40% aqueous solution
          of dimethylamine and 12.75 g of 35% formaldehyde solution. The whole
          mixture was left well closed in the dark at room temperature for 10
          days with occasional shaking. Thereafter, the methanol was driven off
          in vacuo and 45 ml of water was added to the residue. The separated
          product was filtered and recrystallized from petroleum-ether (bp 60-80°C),
          mp 79-80°C, yield 25.3 g (80%).</p>
        <p><strong>Quaternization of III to IV</strong></p>
        <p>To a solution of 21 g (0.099 mol) of <strong>III</strong> in 90 ml of absolute
          ethanol, 28.2 g (0.198 mol) of methyl iodide was added under stirring
          and cooling, resulting in an exothermic reaction accompanied by the
          precipitation of the product <strong>IV</strong>. After complete addition, the reaction
          mixture was allowed to stand overnight. The separated solid was recrystallized
          from ethanol, mp 185-187°C, yield 35g (99%).</p>
        <p><strong>3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide</strong> (<strong>V</strong>)</p>
        <p>A solution of 35.3g (0.1 mol) of the methiodide <strong>IV</strong> and
          26g (0.4 mol) of KCN in 200 ml of water was refluxed for 2.5 h. After
          cooling, the solution was cautiously acidified with 2 M HCl and extracted
          with CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The CHCl<sub>3</sub> extract was dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and the solvent removed
          in vacuo to give 15.4 g of an oil (80 %), which is used as such without
          further purification in the next step.</p>
        <p><strong>3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzyl cyanide</strong> (<strong>VI</strong>)</p>
        <p>To a solution of 30g (0.156 mol) of <strong>V</strong> in 200 ml of dry
          acetone was added 27.6g (0.2 mol) of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 31.2g (0.22 mol) of methyl
          iodide. The mixture was refluxed for 20 h. After cooling and filtration,
          the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was extracted with
          CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The CHCl<sub>3</sub> extract was washed with 2M NaOH, 10% Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and then
          with water. After drying over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and removal of the solvent, the
          crystalline was recrystallized from petroleum-ether (60-80°C), mp 76-77°C,
          yield 27g (83.8%) (Lit.<a href="mescaline.mannich.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> 76-77°C). <strong>VI</strong> was further identified by comparing
          mixed melting point and comparative IR spectrum with an authentic sample.</p>
        <p><strong>Mescaline hydrochloride</strong> (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
        <p>To a suspension of 10 g LiAlH<sub>4</sub> in 300 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran
          was added a solution of 20.7 (0.1 mol) of <strong>VI</strong> in 60ml of dry tetrahydrofuran
          over a period of 30 min. After complete addition, the whole mixture
          was refluxed for 3 h and then cooled. The complex and excess hydride
          were decomposed with saturated Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution and filtered. The combined
          filtrate and washings were evaporated in vacuo. The calculated amount
          of methanolic hydrogen chloride was added to the residue and the mescaline
          hydrochloride was recrystallized from 2-propanol, mp 180-181°C, yield
          19.5g (79%) (Lit.<a href="mescaline.mannich.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> 180-181°C). Mescaline hydrochloride was further
          identified by comparing mixed melting point and comparative IR spectrum
          with an authentic sample.</p>
