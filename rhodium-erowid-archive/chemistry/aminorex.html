<h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>A case in which aminorex (cis (�)-4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine) was 
      prepared as a "designer" analog of a controlled substance, methylaminorex 
      (cis-(�)-4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine) is described. The 
      confiscated drug sample was analyzed by high-field (300-MHz) proton nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy, as well as electron 
      impact mass spectrometry (70 eV). These examinations proved conclusively 
      that the material in question was aminorex.</p>

  <p>An illicit compound which has recently been identified in several solid samples 
    seized in Florida and California is cis-(�)-4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine, 
    also known as methylaminorex, ice, or euphoria (U4Euh)<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
    This oxazoline exerts potent central nervous system sympathomimetic effects 
    not unlike those of methamphetamine<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>2-4</sup></a>. Methylaminorex 
    was first prepared in 1962 as a potential anorexic agent<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>. 
    There appears to be widespread use of this designer drug, and illicit use 
    of this compound has resulted in at least one fatality<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
    Through the efforts of various law enforcement agencies, this substance has 
    recently been controlled (Schedule I) under emergency scheduling provisions 
    of the controlled substances act<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>6,7</sup></a>. With this 
    scrutiny, alternatives to the methylaminorex structure have been sought to 
    avoid potential prosecution. For this reason, the desmethyl derivative, that 
    is, aminorex, was synthesized (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong>). It is an interesting 
    circumstance that aminorex was reported in the same literature as was methylaminorex. 
    Aminorex, under the trademark Menocil&reg;, proceeded to the point that it 
    was introduced into the European market (West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) 
    as an anorexic agent in February of 1966. During its use, an unacceptably 
    high incidence of pulmonary hypertension was reported, which led to the deaths 
    of several individuals<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>8-10</sup></a>. These side effects 
    caused this drug to be withdrawn from the market in November 1968. A new drug 
    application (NDA) which was pending in the United States was also discontinued 
    at that time. The illicit use of this formerly marketed drug as an alternative 
    to its methylated analog was recently observed and is described here.</p>

<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>

<h4>Chemicals</h4>

  <p>The compound cis(�)-4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine, which was 
    used for comparative purposes, was prepared according to the method of Poos 
    et al.<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>. All the solvents used were of reagent 
    or spectroscopic quality and were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co.</p>

<h4>Analytical Procedures</h4>

  <p>The melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary melting-point 
    apparatus and were uncorrected. Proton (<sup>1</sup>H) and carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) 
    nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Vanan XL 300 
    spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in an appropriate deuterated solvent, 
    usually deuterated chloroform (CDCl<sub>3</sub>), and chemical shifts<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> 
    were reported relative to an internal standard [tetramethylsilane (TMS)]. 
    The mass spectra were recorded on a Kratos MS8ORFA Spectrometer. Thin-layer 
    chromatography utilized EM reagent DC-aluminum foil plates, coated to a thickness 
    of 0.2 mm with silica gel 60.</p>

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

  <p>A sample of a white powder was recently confiscated from a white male in 
    Florida. The suspect indicated that the seized material was not a controlled 
    substance. The solid was analyzed by various analytical methods, including 
    high- field (300-MHz) proton (<sup>1</sup>H) and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy 
    and electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry (70 eV). ln addition, the purity 
    of the solid was determined chromatographically. The melting point of the 
    sample was found to be 124 to 127�C, which was lower than the reported melting 
    point for either methylaminorex (150 to 152�C) or aminorex (136 to 138�C)<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>11</sup></a>. 
    Thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed an R<sub>f</sub> value for the 
    material in question of 0.43 when eluted on silica plates using a mobile phase 
    containing 85:10:5 ethyl acetate/methanol/concentrated ammonium hydroxide. 
    Several impurities were detected at R<sub>f</sub> values both greater and 
    less than that of the compound of interest. Another indication of the impurity 
    of the samples examined was their microcombustion profiles, which indicated 
    deviation from the accepted carbon values of between 2 and 15%.</p>

  <p>The proton NMR spectrum for aminorex and its structural assignments are provided 
    in <strong>Fig. 2</strong>. Unlike the spectrum of methylaminorex, no upfield 
    (<3 &delta;) absorbances characteristic of a methyl group occur in the><sup>1</sup>H 
    NMR spectrum of the confiscated sample.</p>

  <p>The obtained spectrum is indicative of the assigned structure of aminorex, 
    with the phenyl group appearing at 7.35 &delta;, a benzylic methine triplet 
    at 5.46 &delta;, the exchangeable amino group at 5.2 &delta;, and the nonequivalent 
    hydrogens of the methylene group &beta; to the phenyl ring at 4.13 and 3.65&delta;. 
    The <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum is equally supportive of the 4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine 
    structure, with no upfield methyl signal and with the remaining carbon absorbances 
    occurring at their expected 8 values (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). Decoupling 
    analysis of this spectrum indicates quaternary and secondary carbons at 160.89 
    &delta;, 140.62 &delta;, and 60.63 &delta;, corresponding to the imine carbon 
    (C-2), the phenyl carbon attached to C-5, and the methylene carbons (C-4). 
    The remaining methine carbons manifested signals at 128.62 &delta;, 128.14 
    &delta;, 125.66 &delta;, corresponding to the phenyl carbons, and at 81.43 
    &delta;, which was assigned as the C-5 absorbance.</p>

<p>Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on the sample in question by probe 
    distillation introduction. This technique indicated the presence of impurities 
    which vaporized at higher temperatures than did the object compound. An El 
    spectrum of the material is given in <strong>Fig. 4</strong>. The fragmentation 
    pattern and the molecular ion are indicative of the aminorex structure and 
    compare well with those of standard spectra<a href="aminorex.html#refs"><sup>12</sup></a>. 
    The M<sup>+</sup> peak is 162 <em>m/z</em>. Loss of the carboxamide group 
    CONH<sub>2</sub> produces the fragment at 118 <em>m/z</em>, while generation 
    of protonated benzyl alcohol results in the <em>m/z</em> = 107 fragment. Other 
    important fragments include the tropylium ion (91 <em>m/z</em>) and the phenyl 
    cation at 77 <em>m/z</em>. The base peak of the spectra (56 <em>m/z</em>) 
    appears to be due to the imine structure, NH<sub>2</sub>-C=N-CH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>. 
    The mass spectrum reported for methylaminorex is characterized by an M<sup>+</sup> 
    of 176 <em>m/z</em> and a base peak of 70 <em>m/z</em>, each differing by 
    14 mass units from the corresponding aminorex fragments. The collected analytical 
    information leaves little doubt that the compound in question was the desmethyl 
    derivative, aminorex, of the controlled substance methylaminorex.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <p>A case was identified in which a drug formerly marketed as an anorexic agent, 
    aminorex, was found to be used in an apparently illicit manner as a substitute 
    for methylaminorex. Analysis of a recently impounded sample conclusively proved 
    that the material was aminorex, an identification based on <sup>1</sup>H and 
    <sup>13</sup>C spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.</p>
