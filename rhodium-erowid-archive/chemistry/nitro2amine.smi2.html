  <p>The reaction of SmI<sub>2</sub> with nitroarenes gives the corresponding 
    anilines<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, to our knowledge there are 
    no literature precedents for the reduction of alkyl nitro compounds to either 
    alkyl hydroxylamines or alkyl amines by SmI<sub>2</sub>. During the course 
    of our studies using SmI<sub>2</sub> as a reducing agent<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
    we found that in the presence of MeOH as a proton source, primary, secondary, 
    and tertiary alkyl nitro compounds were reduced by SmI<sub>2</sub> to either 
    hydroxylamines or amines depending upon reaction conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>Table I</strong> shows that reductions to the hydroxylamines proceeded 
    well with either primary, secondary, or tertiary nitroalkanes. In general, 
    reduction of the nitro group with 4 molar equivalents of SmI<sub>2</sub> in 
    THF/MeOH (2:1) proceeded smoothly in less than five minutes and simple workup 
    of the reaction mixture alIowed isolation of the corresponding hydroxylamines 
    in good yields. The TBDPS group was well tolerated (entries <strong>1</strong>, 
    <strong>2</strong>, <strong>6</strong>, and <strong>8</strong>). Yields appeared 
    Iower for substrates <strong>9</strong><a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> and 
    <strong>17</strong><a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> containing an acetal or 
    a ketal functionality at the <img src="pictures/greek/beta.gif">-position 
    (entries <strong>3</strong> and <strong>7</strong>). However, the alkyl nitro 
    compound <strong>21</strong><a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> containing an 
    acetal at the <img src="pictures/greek/gamma.gif" width="6" height="10">-position 
    gave the corresponding hydroxylamine in 88% yield (entry <strong>9</strong>). 
    In the case of the nitro ester <strong>13</strong>, the expected hydroxylamine 
    was not formed, and only a complex mixture was obtained (entry <strong>5</strong>).</p>

  

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

    <p>A typical procedure for the SmI<sub>2</sub> reductions of Table <strong>1</strong> 
      follows. To a stirred solution of freshly prepared<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> 
      SmI<sub>2</sub> (4.0 mmol) in THF (30 mL) was rapidly added a solution of 
      the nitro compound 5 (1.0 mmol) in a 2:1 mixture of THF/MeOH (6 mL). The 
      reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 3 minutes, poured into a 10% solution 
      of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (30 mL) and extracted with EtOAc 
      several times. The residue was chromatographed over silica gel (EtOAc) to 
      give 6 in 79% yield.<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>7,8</sup></a></p>
    <p>When the reductions were performed with 6 molar equivalents of SmI<sub>2</sub> 
      at RT for several hours (see Table 2), the nitroalkanes were cleanly transformed 
      into the corresponding primary amines, identified in this study as the corresponding 
      4-phenylbenzamides. Thus, to a stirred solution of SmI<sub>2</sub> (4.2 
      mmol) in THF (30 mL) was added a solution of nitroalkane <strong>15</strong> 
      (0.7 mmol) in a 2:1 mixture of THF/MeOH (6 mL). The reaction mixture was 
      stirred for 8 h to give after workup as above the crude amine 29. This was 
      dissolved in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (15 mL) and treated with Et<sub>3</sub>N 
      (0.5 mL), then with 4-phenylbenzoyl chloride (2.3 mmol), and stirred at 
      RT overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and H2O, the organic 
      phase separated, and the aqueous phase extracted with EtOAc several times. 
      The residue was chromatographed over silica gel (hexane/EtOAc, 85:15) to 
      give <strong>30</strong> in 79% yield.<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<br>Reduction of Nitroalkanes

</div> 


  <p>When 3-nitro acetal <strong>9</strong> or 3-nitro ketal <strong>17</strong> 
    were reacted with 6 equivalents of SmI<sub>2</sub> under the above reaction 
    conditions, less than 20% of a complex mixture of unidentified products was 
    isolated. Rapid decomposition of the primary reduction products could be observed 
    under the reaction conditions.</p>
  <p>Thus, we have demonstrated that in the presence of MeOH as a proton source, 
    using 4 or 6 molar equivalents of SmI<sub>2</sub> and by controlling the reaction 
    time, a variety of nitroalkanes are cleanly reduced to either hydroxylamines 
    or amines in moderate to good yields. This mild method offers exceptional 
    simplicity and convenience in workup and compares very favorably to alternative 
    procedures for laboratory syntheses of alkyl hydroxylamines or alkyl amines<a href="nitro2amine.smi2.html#refs"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
