<h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>Stereospecific synthesis of the racemic <em>threo</em> isomers of 2-nitro-1-phenylpropanols 
      by reacting a benzaldehyde derivative with nitroalkane in the presence of 
      a tertiary amine and reducing 2-nitro-1-phenylpropanols with, for example, 
      lithium aluminum hydride to 2-amino-1-phenylpropanols is described. Also 
      described are phase transfer resolution of racemic mixtures of 2-amino-1-phenylpropanol 
      and its derivatives into their optically pure isomers by reacting a racemic 
      mixture with the mono alkali metal salt of a tartaric acid ester in a two 
      phase system of a hydrocarbon and water. The specification further describes 
      therapeutically useful optically pure isomers of threo-2-amino-1-(dialkoxy 
      or alkoxy) phenylpropanols and acid addition salts thereof.</p>

<h3>Prior Art</h3>

  <p>Mixed stereoisomers of 2-amino-1-phenylpropanol can be readily prepared by 
    reacting benzaldehyde with nitroethane in the presence of an alkaline catalyst 
    to produce 2- nitro-1-phenylpropanol which is then reduced to the amine. E.g., 
    <a href="nor-pseudo-ephedrine.html">Hoover and Hass, Journal of Organic Chemistry, 
    12, 506, (1947)</a>. This reaction gives excellent yields at low cost. However, 
    separating the stereoisomers produced by this reaction has not been satisfactory. 
    As a result, heretofore, the only practical stereospecific synthesis of 2-amino-1-phenylpropanols 
    involves the reduction of propiophenone derivatives to the racemic erythro 
    diastereoisomers and fractional crystallization of the amine salt of an optically 
    active acid.</p>

  <p>The DL-<em>erythro</em> forms can be readily obtained from the appropriate 
    propiophenone derivatives or by inversion of DL-<em>threo</em> derivatives. 
    Since the pharmacological properties of the D and L isomers differ, it is 
    desirable to separate the two, resulting in maximum therapeutic utility. While 
    such potentially useful products can also be prepared, the difficulty of separating, 
    i.e. "resolution", the isomers has prevented their development.</p>

<p>Specifically, the base is converted to a salt of an optically active acid. For example, the DL-base is reacted with a D-acid. This results in the formation of a mixture 
of D-base-D-acid and L-base-D-acid. These two salts differ in solubility. When the mixture is cooled and allowed to stand, the D-base-D-acid, typically being the less 
soluble, precipitates out of the solution first. By removing the precipitate at the appropriate time, the collected precipitate is largely the D-base-D-acid, while the L-
base-D-acid remains in solution.</p>

<p>While this results in purification of the optical isomers to some extent, substantial impurities often remain. These impurities are removed to some degree by fractional 
crystallization. The "pure" D and L bases are then liberated by adding a sufficient amount of an alkali to a solution of the "pure" salt to produce a pH above 7.</p>

<p>The above process is very tedious, time consuming, and inefficient. In addition, a base with the same configuration as the resolving acid is more easily separated and 
purified than the opposite enantiomer. Consequently, in practice, the desired isomeric base must be matched with an optically active acid of the same configuration to 
achieve maximum yields.</p>


<h3>Description Of Invention</h3>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/norephedrine1.gif">
</div>

  <p>It has been discovered that if a benzaldehyde derivative is reacted with 
    a nitroalkane in the presence of a tertiary amine, the nitroalcohol formed 
    is of a threo configuration rather than a mixture of <em>threo</em> and <em>erythro</em> 
    isomers which results when sodium hydroxide is used as the catalyst. The reaction 
    is best conducted in an aqueous aliphatic alcohol.</p>

<p>The tertiary amine employed must be free of primary and secondary amines which interfere with the reaction. These can be removed from the commercial products by refluxing 
with acetic or phthalic anhydride followed by distillation.</p>

<p>In a preferred embodiment of the synthetic method of the present invention, a benzaldehyde derivative is reacted with nitroethane in the presence of triethylamine in 
aqueous ethanol. The mixture is allowed to react at room temperature for twenty-four hours. The mixture is then acidified with an organic acid since mineral acids tend to 
promote decomposition, as does heat. Excess solvents and reactants are evaporated and the nitroalcohol extracted.</p>

<div class="pic right">
<img src="pictures/norephedrine2.gif">
</div>

  <p>The nitroalcohol can easily be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation or conventional 
    reducing agents such as zinc and acid. Lithium aluminum hydride has been found 
    to work exceptionally well. The racemic threo isomers can readily be inverted 
    to the racemic <em>erythro</em> isomers by reaction with acetic anhydride 
    and thionyl chloride and hydrolysis. N-methyl derivatives can be prepared 
    by adding an equimolecular amount of aqueous formaldehyde to the primary amine 
    and reducing the Schiff base The use of a primary aliphatic alkylamine results 
    in the formation of the dehydration product of the nitroalcohol - the <em>beta</em>-nitrostyrene. 
    By employing a secondary or tertiary amine in the presence of water, nitrostyrene 
    formation is completely eliminated. The use of a secondary or tertiary amine 
    prevents the formation of a Schiff base amine, the necessary intermediary 
    for nitrostyrene formation.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual fractional crystallization of the amine-acid salt, the method of resolving stereo isomers of the present invention uses a novel phase transfer 
resolution. It has been discovered that if the amine base is rapidly stirred with a mono alkali metal salt of a tartaric acid ester in a two-phase system of a hydrocarbon 
and water, a rapid and efficient resolution can be achieved.</p>

  <p>In a practical embodiment of the resolution method of the present invention, 
    a DL-2-amino-1-phenylpropanol derivative in dichloromethane is combined and 
    stirred with dibenzoyltartaric acid in water, and aqueous sodium hydroxide 
    for from about one to three hours. The reaction mixture is then allowed to 
    stand for the about same length of time. The dichloromethane phase is separated 
    and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation gives the L-<em>threo</em> 
    isomer in nearly quantitative yield. The aqueous phase is made alkaline with 
    ammonia and extracted with dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extract is 
    dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give the D-<em>threo</em> 
    isomer in nearly quantitative yield.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

    <p>A racemic mixture of <em>threo</em> nitroalcohols was prepared by combining 
      freshly distilled benzaldehyde (1 mole), nitroethane (2.5 moles), and triethylamine 
      (0.05 mole) in ethanol (150 ml.) with water (75 ml). This mixture was allowed 
      to stand at room temperature in the dark for twenty-four hours. The mixture 
      was then ice-cooled and acetic acid (0.05 mole) was added to the reaction 
      mixture. Alcohol and excess nitroethane were evaporated (vacuum). Water 
      (75 ml) was added and the nitro alcohol extracted with ethyl acetate, dried 
      over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent evaporated (vacuum) to give 
      the product, a viscous oil (yield 70-80% based on the benzaldehyde).</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>The nitro alcohols were reduced by two methods, a zinc and acid method and a lithium aluminum hydride method as described below:</p>

<h5>(A) Zinc and Acid</h5>

<p>Hydrochloric acid (4 moles) is added (with stirring) to a mixture of nitroalcohol (1 mole), zinc dust (4 moles), and 400 ml. of 95% ethanol. The acid is added at such a 
rate that the temperature remains at 45 degrees or below (several hours are usually required). Stirring is continued for 1-2 hours after completing the addition. The acid 
solution is extracted with ether to remove non-basic materials. Excess NaOH solution is then added and the free base extracted with ether. The ether solution is dried 
(MgSO<sub>4</sub>) evaporated, and the product distilled or crystallized in the usual manner (70-80% yield).</p>

<h5>(B) Lithium Aluminum Hydride ("LAH")</h5>

    <p>A solution of the nitroalcohol (1 mole) in tetrahydrofuran (400 ml) is 
      added to a solution of lithium aluminum hydride (4 moles) in tetrahydrofuran 
      (500 ml) with rapid stirring and cooling (as necessary) to maintain gentle 
      reflux. After the addition is complete, the mixture is refluxed for an additional 
      2 hours.</p>

<p>Water is added to neutralize excess LAH (1 liter) and the product extracted with benzene. The benzene extract is dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and the benzene evaporated. The resulting 
product is purified by either distillation or crystallization (80-90% yield).</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>The reaction mixture of reduced nitro alcohols was resolved into optically pure isomers by the following process.</p>

    <p>A mixture of a DL-threo-2-amino-1-phenylpropanol (1 mole) in dichloromethane 
      (600 ml), dibenzoyltartaric acid (0.5 mole) in distilled water (30 ml), 
      and sodium hydroxide (0.5 mole) in distilled water (50 ml) is stirred rapidly 
      for two hours and allowed to stand for two hours. The dichloromethane phase 
      is separated using a separating funnel over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. 
      Rotary evaporation of the dichloromethane phase gives the L-<em>threo</em> 
      isomer in nearly quantitative yield.</p>

    <p>The aqueous phase is made alkaline with ammonia to pH 13 and extracted with 
      dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium 
      sulfate and evaporated to give the D-<em>threo</em> isomer in nearly quantitative 
      yield. The enantiomeric purity of the products is 96-99% based on GLC analysis 
      of the D or L- <img src="pictures/greek/alpha.gif">-methoxy-<img src="pictures/greek/alpha.gif">- 
      trifluromethylphenylacetamide (MTPA) derivatives.</p>
