<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Sufentanil, a potent anilidopiperidine analgesic, was synthesized from a simple thio-phenylethylamine via a
six step sequence. The key parts of this synthesis involved an efficient construction of thiophenylethylpiperidone
by aminomethano desilylation-cyclization followed by Swern oxidation and a direct regioselective N-nucleophilic
spiral epoxide cleavage with aniline promoted by Lewis acids.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Sufentanil (<strong>1</strong>), a well-known analgesic characterized by high potency, a rapid onset, and short duration of
action, belongs to a series of the 4-propionanilidopiperidines which represents a class of morphine-like
analgesics<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. The extensive synthetic studies focused on 4-anilidopiperidine and its
structural analogues<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> have recently been carried out, although few synthetic studies on
sufentanil have been reported. More recently, a series of work on the syntheses of sufentanil and its
structural analogues have been carried out in our laboratory in conjunction with development of the novel
analgesic agents. We have also reported an ideal synthetic route to N-arylpiperidines as a part of our
successful results<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> and we herein describe a total synthesis of sufentanil in full detail.</p>


<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>Unless noted otherwise, all starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used
without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl.
N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide were distilled under reduced pressure from calcium hydride and
stored over 4A molecular sieves under argon. Dichloromethane, triethylamine, benzene, toluene, and pyridine
were freshly distilled from calcium hydride. Nitromethane was distilled and stored over calcium hydride under
argon. All solvents used for routine isolation of products and chromatography were reagent grade and
distilled. Reaction flasks were oven dried at 120�C. Air and moisture sensitive reactions were performed under
an argon atmosphere. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck) with
indicated solvents. Thin-layer chromatography was performed using 0.25 mm silica gel plates (Merck). Melting
points were measured on a Buchi melting point apparatus and were uncorrected.</p>

<h4>4-Hydroxy-1-(2-thiophenethyl)-piperidine (7)</h4>

<p>A heterogenous mixture of allyltrimethylsilane (2.0 mL, 12.6 mmol), water (2.8 ml), thiophenylethylammonium
trifluoroacetate (2.02 g, 8.4 mmol) and 37% aqueous formaldehyde (1.87 ml, 23.1 mmol) in water was stirred at
58�C for 24 hours. Water was added and then the reaction mixture was alkalized with 1N NaOH and extracted with
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated. The residue
was purified by column chromatograph) (MeOH/CHCl<sub>3</sub>, 1:10) to give the piperidine <strong>7</strong> (0.77 g, 43.3%) as a white solid.</p>

<h4>1-(2-Thiophenethyl)-4-piperidone (8)</h4>

<p>Oxalyl chloride (0.44 ml, 5.17 mmol) dissolved in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (12 ml) was placed in a flask under nitrogen. The
flask was cooled to -78�C and DMSO (0.73 mL) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2.15 mL) was added dropwise for about 5 min. Stirring
was continued at -78�C for an additional 10 min followed by addition of the alcohol 7 (575 mg, 2.72 mmol) in
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (2 ml) for about 5 min. After additional 15 min with stirring, triethylamine (2.88 mL, 20.7 mmol) was
added for about 5 min with stirring and then the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature.
Water (12 ml) was added and the aqueous layer was reextracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (50 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed with brine, and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The filtered solution was concentrated and
the residue was purified by column chromatography to give the ketone <strong>8</strong> (556 mg, 98%) as a white solid.</p>
<h4>4-Anilinomethyl-4-hydroxy-1-(2-thiophenethyl)piperidine (10)<br>
  and 2-Anilino-1-(2-thiophenethyl)-4-piperidylmethanol (11)</h4>

<p>Aniline (0.16 ml, 1.76 mmol) and triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (0.44 ml of 1M solution in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 0.44 mmol)
was added to the oxirane <strong>9</strong> (196 mg, 0.88 mmol) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (8 ml) at -78�C. The mixture was stirred at -78�C for 6 h.
After quenching with water, the solution was basified with 1 N NaOH and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (20 ml). The organic
layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to
give piperidylmethanol <strong>11</strong> (19.7 mg, 6.2%), and hydroxypiperidine <strong>10</strong> (15.5 mg, 4.8%).</p>

<h4>N-[4-Methoxymethyl-1-(2-thiophenethyl)]-4-piperidyl-N-phenylpropanamide (Sufentanil) (1)</h4>

<p>A mixture of piperidylamine <strong>12</strong> (1.4 mg, 0.004 mmol) and propionic anhydride (1.2 mL, 0.009 mol) was refluxed with
stirring for 19 hours. Cooled to 0�C, the mixture was basified with NH<sub>4</sub>OH and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The organic
layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated. The residue was chromatographed to give  sufentanil <strong>1</strong> (0.8 mg, 50%).</p>

<h3>Results And Discussion</h3>

<p>Our synthetic approach shown in <strong>Scheme 1</strong> involved an efficient construction of the piperidone skeleton via
sequential aminomethano desilylation-cyclization and oxidation of the resulting hydroxypiperidine. The N-arylalkylpiperidone
  <strong>3</strong> was also directly converted to the spiroepoxypiperidine <strong>2</strong> as a second potential intermediate which reacted
with aniline to afford 4-anilinopiperidine along with 4-anilinomethylpiperidine as its regioisomer.</p>

</div>

<p>The intramolecular Mannich type cyclization as a key step of our synthesis was conducted, as outlined in
  <strong>Scheme 2</strong>, by a reaction of trifluoroacetic acid salt of the starting thiophenethylamine <strong>5</strong> with 1.1 equivalent
of allyltrimethylsilane and 2.3 equivalent of 37% aqueous formaldehyde<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>3,5</sup></a>. The resulting 4-hydroxythiophenethylpiperidine <strong>7</strong> was oxidized to piperidone <strong>8</strong> by the introduction
of epoxide moiety. It should be noted that only Swern oxidation was effective for oxidation of
hydroxypiperidine<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The one step conversion of thiophenylethylpiperidone <strong>8</strong> to the spiroexpoxide <strong>9</strong> as a second potential
intermediate was achieved by dimethylsulfonium ylide treatment as shown in <strong>Scheme 2</strong>. The variety of reaction
conditions for regioselective ring opening of the epoxide at more substituted carbon by aniline were examined.</p>

<p>Triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (Et<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) as Lewis acid in methylene chloride below -78�C turned out to be
the best choice for the highest regioselectivity (1.8:1) in favor of <strong>11</strong>. Usage of other Lewis acids afforded
the regioisomer <strong>10</strong> as a predominant product or only byproducts by retro-Mannich type reaction. Although the
regioselectivity and yields are not satisfactory yet, the direct introduction of aniline nucleophile to
spiroepoxide at more substituted carbon enables the two step conversion of the arylalkylpiperidone to the
highly advanced sufentanyl intermediate. Methylation of piperidylmethanol (<strong>11</strong>) was achieved by an initial
reaction with diazomethane<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>. Finally, the synthesis was completed by the known acylation of
anilinopiperidine <strong>12</strong> with propionic anhydride<a href="sufentanil.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> to afford the desired product which was
identical in all aspects to the authentic sufentanil.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the total synthesis of sufentanil was accomplished by only six step reaction sequence. The
key features of this synthesis include the efficient construction of thiophenethylpiperidine skeleton from
thiophenethylamine and the regioselective ring opening of spiroepoxide at more substituted carbon by
N-nucleophile. This methodology is applicable to the efficient syntheses of other anilinopiperidine analgesics
and their structural analogues.</p>
