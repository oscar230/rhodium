<h2>Alkyl Halides to Aldehydes and Ketones<br>Using 2-Nitropropane and NaOH</h2>

<div class="stdtxt">


<p>The main use of this method is to convert benzyl halides to benzaldehydes and 1-phenyl-2-halopropanes to phenyl-2-propanones, as for example
the preparation of MDP2P in 90% yield from bromosafrole.</p>


<p>A reaction between 2-nitropropane and benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-dimethylamine gave acetoxime and N.N-dimethylbenzamide-Benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-piperidine and 2-
nitropropane gave acetoxime and benzoylpiperidine. The reactions appear to proceed by formation of aminobenzyl 2-propanenitronates which
disproportionate into acetoxime and benzamides, thus establishing a relationship with the reaction of halides with sodium 2-propanenitronate to form
esters with subsequent disproportionation. The latter reaction has been found to go well in wet solvents and even in water. The reaction has been
extended to synthesize the aliphatic aldehydes, undecanal and dodecanal, as well as <span class="redtxt">3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone </span>and cyclohexadione.</p>

<div class="pic left">

<p>Among a number of routes that could conceivably lead to a phenyl-substituted &alpha;-butylamine was a Mannich reaction involving benzaldehyde, dimethylamine
and 2-nitropropane. When this reaction was attempted, no Mannich base formed. The products of the reaction were acetoxime and N,N-dimethylbenzamide.
The same products, plus dimethylamine, resulted from an attempted abbreviated Mannich reaction<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> with preformed benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-dimethylamine and 2-nitropropane. The expected reaction, forming Mannich base, should have been carbon alkylation of the active hydrogen compound, 2-nitropropane, by the
cation <b>1</b> resulting from the interaction of benzaldehyde and dimethylamine.</p>

<p>The unexpected formation of acetoxime and dimethylbenzamide is explicable only if the two result from the disproportionation of the ester, &alpha;-dimethylaminobenzyl 2-propanenitronate, arising from oxygen alkylation of 2-propanenitronic acid by the cation. Although this reaction has not been
reported previously, it may be classified among a number of reported reactions<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> of halides and salts of nitronic acids giving rise to carbonyl
compounds corresponding to the halides and oximes corresponding to the nitronic acids. Earlier examples of similar reactions involve
mononitroparaffins other than 2-nitropropane. There can be little doubt that these reactions proceed through the disproportionation of an
intermediate nitronic ester into an oxime and a carbonyl compound. The major side-reaction appears to be carbon-alkylation when alkylating with
highly activated
halogen compounds.

</p>

<p>

A reaction converting an aldehyde to an amide, while a fascinating
facet, seems of limited interest. The same reaction was used to
convert benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-piperidine to benzoylpiperidine, but failed
with an aliphatic aldehyde, n-hexaldehyde. Heating n-hexaldehyde,
dimethylamine and 2-nitropropane led to a partial recovery of starting
materials and a 61% yield of the Knoevenagel product,
2-hexylidenehexaldehyde. The formation of the latter product rather
than the nitronic ester (and disproportionation products) was probably
favored by both the temperature and basicity. The possibility of the
Knoevenagel reaction, when catalyzed by secondary amines, proceeding
via the <em>bis</em>-amine has been mentioned previously.<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">1</a></sup> A similar reaction using the preformed
bis-dimethylamine from 3,5,5-trimethylhexaldehyde was contemplated,
but it was abandoned when only the metholamine,
N-(1-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylhexyl)-dimethylamine, was obtained from
the attempted preparation of <em>bis</em>-dimethylamine.

</p>

<p>

The two successful examples of amide preparation seem to be dependent
on temperature, requiring some forcing. On refluxing benzaldehyde,
aqueous dimethylamine and 2-nitropropane in ethanol for two hours, the
yield of N,N-dimethylbenzamide was 37%. Benzylidene-bis-dimethylamine
and 2-nitropropane without solvent at 120-130�, produced a 94% yield.
That the difference is due to temperature and not to the use of
preformed bis-amine was shown clearly by the benzoylpiperidine
synthesis. Heating benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-piperidine and 2-nitropropane in
refluxing ethanol for four hours led to no benzoylpiperidine, 93% of
the benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-piperidine being recovered. On dispensing with
solvent and heating at 130-140�, benzoylpiperidine was obtained in 54%
yield.

</p>

<p>

The preparation of dimethylbenzamide in aqueous alcohol suggested that
the more general reaction, converting halides to carbonyl compounds,
might not necessarily require metallic sodium and anhydrous alcohol,
and might be a preparative reaction for aliphatic carbonyl compounds
under milder conditions. The formation and disproportionation of
2-propanenitronic esters have been found to take place smoothly and
with good yields for monocarbonyl compounds. It is not necessary to
use metallic sodium and anhydrous alcohol. The reactions go well in
95% ethanol using salts formed in the solvent from 2-nitropropane and
sodium or potassium hydroxide before adding the halide. By this
procedure <b>3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone</b>, undecanal and dodecanal
were obtained in good yield. It has been reported<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">3</a></sup> that aliphatic aldehydes are not obtained under
anhydrous conditions.</p>

<p>

To test the feasibility of using water without alcohol, a suspension
of benzyl chloride was heated and stirred in an aqueous solution of
potassium 2-propanenitronate, giving a 49% yield of benzaldehyde. The
possibility that the aqueous conditions might operate against a
carbon-alkylation side-reaction had to be discarded when
para-nitrobenzyl chloride was treated with an aqueous solution of
sodium 2-propanenitronate and found to give a 59% yield of the
carbon-alkylation product, 2-methyl
2-nitro-1-(para-nitrophenyl)-propane, and no para-nitrobenzaldehyde.

</p>


<p>

The presence of acetoxime in water-insoluble aldehydes or ketones
presents no problem since it is readily removable from ether solution
by water. In some preliminary experiments, last traces of acetoxime
appeared as crystals in the condenser from which it was sublimed into
the trap by using warm water in the condenser. Acetoxime presents a
more serious problem when the other product is also water soluble,
e.g., succindialdehyde and 1,2-cyclohexadione. Preparation and
separation of a derivative was considered inadvisable because of the
amounts involved, and distillation of the mixtures was attempted.
Distillation was only moderately successful for cyclohexadione,
because decomposition during the prolonged heating held the yield down
to 30%. In the attempted preparation of succindialdehyde from
1,4-dichlorobutane, decomposition during distillation was more rapid,
and no product could be obtained from the residual tar after removal
of the acetoxime fraction. This latter case and other polyfunctional
possibilities require a more searching investigation.

</p>

<p>

Both chloro and bromo compounds have been converted successfully to
carbonyl compounds, usually at reflux temperatures. Activated halogen
as in 2-chlorocyclohexanone reacts vigorously, and it is advisable to
add the reagent slowly with cooling<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. Final refluxing is necessary,
both for completion of the metathesis and disproportionation of the
nitronic ester.

</p>

<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a></h3>

<p><b>Benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-dimethylamine</b></p>

<p>Benzaldehyde (106 g., 1 mole) was poured into a 1-liter flask containing 400 g. of 25% aqueous dimethylamine. The mixture was swirled occasionally
during 10 minutes warming on the steam-cone. After cooling, the aqueous layer was saturated with potassium carbonate and the upper layer separated
with the aid of 100 ml. of benzene. The benzene layer was dried over potassium carbonate, the benzene removed under reduced pressure and the residue
distilled. The product was collected at 57-60�C/(0.9mmHg, 143 g. (80%).</p>

<p><b>N,N-Dimethylbenzamide</b></p>

<p>Benzylidene-<em>bis</em>-dimethylamine (44.5 g., 0.25 mole) was heated in a 200-ml. flask, fitted with a dropping funnel and reflux condenser with drying tube,
in an oil-bath at 120-130�.  2-Nitropropane (22.2 g., 0.25 mole) was added dropwise in the course of 2.5 hours with continuous evolution of
dimethylamine. Heating was continued one additional hour and then the light amber reaction mixture was distilled. The forerun was collected at 
35-70�C/20mmHg, and the dimethylbenzamide at 94-96�C/0.5mmHg, 35g (94%).</p>

<p>The forerun was redistilled, giving white crystals in the receiver and condenser, at 55�C/20mmHg. On recrystallization from heptane, 
it melted at 62-63�C, no depression of mp on mixing with an authentic sample of acetoxime.</p>

<p>Redistillation of the dimethylbenzamide gave bp 266�C, mp 38�C. Because the material was water insoluble<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> and the mp low, it was not analyzed.</p>

<p>

A portion was hydrolyzed with 20% sulfuric acid, precipitating benzoic
acid, m.p. and mixed m.p. 121-122�, after recrystallization from
water. The hydrolysis filtrate was made alkaline and distilled,
trapping the dimethylamine distillate in ice-water. Addition of phenyl
isothiocyanate to the distillate precipitated
N,N-dimethyl-N'-phenylthiourea, m.p. 133-135� after recrystallization
from ethanol.

</p>



<p>

Another preparation of N,N-dimethylbenzamide was made by mixing 0.25
mole each of benzaldehyde (26.5 g.), 2-nitropropane (22.2 g.) and 25%
aqueous dimethylamine (45 g.), with 50 ml. of ethanol. The reaction
was heated under reflux for two hours, cooled, and extracted with
benzene (three 50-ml. portions). The solvents were removed under
reduced pressure and the residue distilled, obtaining 12.5 g. of
benzaldehyde at 40-45� (0.8 mm.), phenylhydrazone m.p. 158�C,<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">7</a></sup> and 14.0 g. (37%) of N,N-dimethylbenzamide at
100-104� (0.8 mm.).

</p>



<p>

<b>Benzoylpiperidine</b>

</p>



<p>

2-Nitropropane (17.8 g., 0.2 mole) and 25.8 g. (0.1 mole) of
benzylidene-bis-piperidine<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">8</a></sup> were mixed in
a 100-mI. flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The flask was heated
in an oil-bath at 130-140� for three hours. After cooling, the dark
oil was poured into 200 ml. of 2.5 N hydrochloric acid and shaken
vigorously. The dark heavy layer was taken up in ether, washed with
water to remove acetoxime, dried over magnesium sulfate and distilled.
After removal of ether and 2-nitropropane, there was obtained 2 g. of
benzaldehyde at 46� (0.8 mm.) and 10.2 g. (54%) of benzoylpiperidine
at 136-139� (0.8 mm.) as a pale lemon oil which solidified to a white
solid, m.p. 46-48�, no depression of m.p. on mixing with an authentic
sample.

</p>



<p>

<b>2-Hexylidenehexaldehyde</b>

</p>



<p>

This compound was the product of an unsuccessful attempt to prepare
N,N-dimethylcaproamide carried out in the following manner,
n-Hexaldehyde (50 g., 0.5 mole) was added to 110 g. of 25% aqueous
dimethylamine (1.1 moles) and heated for five minutes on the
steam-cone. The mixture was cooled, saturated with potassium
carbonate, and the upper phase transferred to a 500-ml. flask fitted
with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. It was heated on the
steam-cone while 44.5 g. (0.5 mole) of 2-nitropropane was added
drop-wise in the course of two hours, and heating continued for one
more hour. After cooling, the mixture was taken up in 50 ml. of ether
and washed with 100 ml. of N hydrochloric acid and three 50-ml.
portions of water. After drying over magnesium sulfate, ether,
unreacted alpha-hexaldehyde and 2-nitropropane were removed at 30 mm.
The 2-hexylidene-hexaldehyde, 28 g. (61%), distilled at 80-82� (0.8
mm.). It was redistilled at 79� (0.7 mm.), with virtually no change
in constants, nD 1.4566, dt 0.8438, MD 58.80 (calcd. 59.06). The
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone melted at 132-133� (from ethanol). </p>



<p>Aqueous dimethylamine (200 g. of 25%, 1.1 moles) in a 500-ml. flask
was cooled in an ice-bath and 71 g. (0.5 mole) of
3,5,5-trimethylhexaldehyde was added slowly with stirring. After
complete addition, the reaction was heated on a steam-bath for 15
minutes, cooled, saturated with potassium carbonate, and the upper
layer separated with the aid of ether. The ether layer was dried over
potassium carbonate and distilled, yielding 60 g. (64%) of the
methylolamine at 81� (22 mm.).</p>

<p>On treating with picric acid in ethanol, dimethylamine picrate formed,
m.p. 159-160�C. The methylolamine, treated with
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and hydrochloric acid in ethanol, gave a
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, m.p. 92-93�, no depression of m.p. when
mixed with a sample prepared from 3,5,5-trimethylhexaldehyde.</p>


<p><b>Benzaldehyde</b></p>

<div class="xpic right">
<img src="pictures/bncl2phcho.gif"></div>

<p>In a 200-ml. two-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a
reflux condenser, 14 g. (0.25 mole) of potassium hydroxide was
dissolved in 25 ml. of water. 2-Nitropropane (22.2 g., 0.25 mole) was
added, and the hot mixture stirred to a clear yellow solution. Benzyl
chloride (31.7 g., 0.25 mole) was added, and the mixture stirred and
heated under reflux for two hours. After cooling, the mixture was
filtered through a glass wool plug to remove precipitated potassium
bromide, washing with 50 ml. of ether. The ether layer was separated,
washed with 25 ml. of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and
distilled. A small amount of acetoxime crystallized in the condenser
(b.p. 52�C (18 mm.)), m.p. and mixed m.p. 61-62�C. The benzaldehyde was
collected at 62�C (1 mm.), 13 g. (49%); phenylhydrazone, m.p.
157-158�C.<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">7</a></sup>

</p>



<p>

<b>2-Methyl-2-nitro-1-(para-nitrophenyl)-propane</b>

</p>

<p>

Sodium hydroxide (12 g., 0.3 mole) was dissolved in 100 ml. of water
and 26.7 g. (0.3 mole) of 2-nitropropane added and stirred to
complete solution. To the solution was added 51.5 g. (0.3 mole) of
para-nitrobenzyl chloride. The suspension was stirred and heated under
reflux for 2.5 hours. After cooling, the supernatant water was
decanted, the heavy oil taken up in 100 ml. of ether, washed twice
with water, and the ether evaporated. The residual oil was
crystallized from 100 ml. of hot ethanol, yielding 37.5 g. (56%) of
crude product, m.p. 58-62�.  Recrystallization from ethanol raised the
m.p. to 64-65�, no depression on mixing with an authentic specimen<sup><a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs">9</a></sup>.

</p>

<p><strong>Undecanal </strong></p>
<p>A solution of 2.80 g. of potassium hydroxide and 4.55 g.
  of 2-nitropropane in 75 ml. of 95% ethanol was added dropwise in the
  course of 45 minutes to a refluxing solution of 11.75 g. of undecyl
  bromide (all reactants 0.05 M) in 50 ml. of 95% ethanol. Refluxing
  was continued for an additional 15 minutes. The solution was cooled
  and decanted from a deposit of sodium bromide; ethanol was removed in
  vacua, the residue taken up in 75 ml. of ether, washed with water (2x30 ml.) and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of ether,
  undecanal<a href="halide.carbonyl.html#refs"><sup>10a</sup></a> was distilled at 64-66�C/0.7mmHg, yield 7.3 g. (85%),
  n<sub>25</sub> 1.4500; 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, mp 105-106�C; oxime, mp 71-72�C.
  A second preparation was started at room temperature and then heated
  under reflux for two hours, resulting in a similar yield.</p>
