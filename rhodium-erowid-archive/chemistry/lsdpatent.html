        <p>d-LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE</p>
        <p>Arthur Stoll and Albert Hofmann, Basel, Switzerland, assignors Sandoz 
          Ltd., Fribourg, Switzerland, a Swiss firm.</p>
        <p> No Drawing. Application April 28, 1944, Serial No. 533,264. In Switzerland 
          April 30, 1943</p>
        <h3>1 Claim. (CI. 260--236)</h3>
        <p>The present invention relates to new d-lysergic acid dialkylamides 
          which are valuable therapeutic products and to a process for their preparation.</p>
        <p> It has been found that by condensing azides of d- or d,l-lysergic 
          acid respectively or of d- or d,l-isolysergic acid respectively or mixtures 
          of these compounds with diakylamines, d-lysergic acid dialkylamides 
          are obtained, which products have not yet become known hitherto. The 
          alkyl groups present in the dialkylamines used according to the present 
          invention can either be identical or different and may be of saturated 
          or unsaturated character. Such amines are for instance dimethylamine, 
          diethylamine, dipropylamine, dibutylamine, diamylamine, methyl-ethylamine, 
          ethyl-allylamine, butyl-amylamine, etc.</p>
        <p> The new d-lysergic acid amides are distinguished from the known natural 
          and synthetic ergot alkaloids and from the d-lysergic acid amides described 
          in our U. S. Patent No. 2,090,430 by their powerful specific action 
          on the central nervous system. </p>
        <p>The condensation of the d-lysergic acid- or d-isolysergic acid azides 
          with the dialkylamines is carried out in the presence of an inert organic 
          solvent and preferably at room temperature. During the reaction taking 
          place between the azides and the dialkylamine generally mixtures of 
          different dialkylamides will be obtained. This can, for instance, be 
          seen in the following illustrative example showing the reaction of d-lysergic 
          acid azide with diethylamine. During the interaction of these compounds 
          a mixture will be obtained consisting of d-lysergic acid diethylamide 
          and of d-isolysergic acid diethylamide, from which mixture the d-lysergic 
          acid derivative will be separated. By using as a starting product d-isolysergic 
          acid azide and diethylamine a mixture of d-lysergic acid diethylamide 
          and of d-isolysergic acid diethylamide will be obtained, this mixture 
          being subsequently separated into its constituents. Finally by starting 
          from racemic lysergic acid azide or racemic isolysergic acid azide, 
          mixtures consisting of d,l-lysergic acid diethylamide and d,l-isolysergic 
          acid diethylamide will be obtained, from which the d-lysergic acid diethyl 
          amide can be separated in a suitable manner, e.g., in form of its tartaric 
          acid salt. </p>
        <p>The following examples, without being limitative, illustrate the present 
          invention, the parts being by weight.</p>
        <h3>Example 1 </h3>
        <p>3 parts of d-isolysergic acid hydrazide are transformed in the usual 
          way in a hydrochloric acid solution by a treatment with sodium nitrite 
          at 0 degrees C. into the azide, and, after neutralization of the acid 
          solution with sodium bicarbonate, the azide thus formed is shaken out 
          by means of 300 parts ethyl ether. The ethereal solution is then dried 
          with freshly calcinated potassium carbonate and treated with 3 parts 
          of diethylamine. The solution is allowed to stand, preferably in the 
          dark and at room temperature, for 24 hours with repeated shaking. The 
          ether is then evaporated in vacuo, the residue triturated with 30 parts 
          of water and filtered by suction. The dark amorphous product thus obtained 
          possesses a specific rotation of [alpha]20/D=about+100 degrees (in pyridine) 
          and consists essentially of a mixture of nearly equal parts of d-lysergic 
          acid diethylamide and d-isolysergic acid diethylamide. </p>
        <p>The separation of both isomers can be carried out for instance by the 
          so-called chromatographic adsorption method. For this purpose the mixture 
          is dissolved in chloroform containing about 0.5% of ethanol and is passed 
          through a column of aluminium oxide of 60 cm. length and 4 cm. radius 
          and the chromatogram developed with the same solvent. The dark impurities 
          pass rapidly into the filtrate. Then follows a bright zone, which has 
          a blue appearance in ultra-violet light and which contains the d-lysergic 
          acid diethylamide. From this fraction 1.0 to 1.3 parts of this product 
          will be obtained. </p>
        <p>A further slowly passing portion of the solution contains the d-isolysergic 
          acid diethylamide. By evaporating this chloroform fraction and crystallizing 
          the residue from acetone, 0.8 to 1.2 parts of a compound crystallizing 
          in beautiful prisms of melting point 182 degrees C. (corr.) under decomposition 
          is obtained, this compound being the pure d-isolysergic acid diethylamide. 
          Its specific rotation is [alpha]20/D=+217 degrees (c=0.4 in pyridine). 
          Elementary analysis has given the following values: C 74.41; H 7.48; 
          N 13.27%. The calculated values for d-isolysergic acid diethylamide, 
          i.e., C20H25ON3 are C 74.25; H 7.79; N 13.00%.</p>
        <p> The d-isolysergic acid diethylamide can be transformed into d-lysergic 
          acid diethylamide by using the methods known for the ergot alkaloids. 
          By allowing the solution of the iso- compound to stand in dilute alcoholic 
          potassium hydroxide, a mixture of about equal parts lysergic acid and 
          isolysergic acid compounds will be produced after a short time. The 
          d-lysergic acid diethylamide can then be separated from the mixture 
          in the manner described above. </p>
        <p>The amorphous d-lysergic acid diethylamide, which can be separated 
          by the chromatographic method, crystallizes, by dissolving it in a small 
          amount of acetone and diluting this solution with ethyl ether, in bundles 
          of needles. From benzene pointed prisms will be obtained, that melt 
          under decomposition at 80-85 degrees C. (corr.). The new compound is 
          difficulty soluble in water, but very soluble in methanol and ethanol. 
          It possesses the specific rotation of [alpha]20/D=+30 degrees (c=0.4 
          in pyridine). Elementary analysis gives the following values: C 73.50; 
          H 7.81; N 12.92%. For d-lysergic acid diethyl amide, C20H25ON3, the 
          calculated values are C 74.25; H 7.79; N 13.00%.</p>
        <p> By dissolving one equivalent of the base with one equivalent of d-tartaric 
          acid in a small quantity of methanol the neutral tartrate of d-lysergic 
          acid diethylamide crystallizes out in form of bundles of needles. The 
          salt is very easily soluble in water and melts indistinctly and under 
          decomposition at 200 degrees C. (corr.).</p>
        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <p> An ethereal solution of d-lysergic acid azide, prepared in the usual 
          manner from 3 parts of d-lysergic acid hydrazide, is treated with 3 
          parts of diethylamine and allowed to stand for 24 hours in the dark 
          and at room temperature with occasional shaking. The isolation of the 
          compound thus produced is carried out in the manner described in the 
          Example 1. The first separation by means of the chromatographic adsorption 
          yields 1.3 to 1.7 parts of d-lysergic acid diethylamide and about 0.5 
          to 0.8 part of d-isolysergic acid diethylamide.</p>
        <h3>Example 3</h3>
        <p>3 parts of racemic isolysergic acid hydrazide are transformed in the 
          usual manner into the respective azide and the formed compound is precipitated 
          by means of an excess of a sodium bicarbonate solution in the form of 
          voluminous yellowish flocks, which are separated by suction and immediately 
          introduced at -5 degrees C. into a solution of 3 parts of diethyl amine 
          in 30 parts of ethanol. The azide readily dissolves in the solution 
          which becomes brown and is then heated slowly to 30 degrees C. The solution 
          is maintained at this temperature for 1 hour, whereupon the solvent 
          is evaporated in vacuo. The sticky residue is triturated with 30 parts 
          of water and filtered. The raw condensation product amounting to about 
          2.8 parts consists of racemic isolysergic acid diethylamide and of racemic 
          lysergic acid diethylamide and is separated by the chromatographic method 
          in the manner described in Example 1. During the chromatographic separation 
          two zones are obtained which are colored, in ultra-violet light, in 
          brilliant blue shades. The more rapidly passing zone contains the racemic 
          lysergic acid diethylamide, whereas the slower passing zone consists 
          of racemic isolysergic acid diethylamide.</p>
        <p>From the racemic lysergic acid diethylamide the d-lysergic acid diethylamide 
          can be separated by transforming the same for instance into its neutral 
          tartaric acid salt. For this purpose 3.2 parts of racemic lysergic acid 
          diethylamide (1/100 mol.) are dissolved in 6 parts of methanol and added 
          to a solution of 0.75 part of d-tartaric acid (1/200 mol.) in 2 parts 
          of methanol.</p>
        <p>On inoculation with d-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate this compound 
          crystallizes out in nearly colorless bundles of needles. Yield 1.0 to 
          1.2 parts. The properties of the compound thus obtained are identical 
          with those described in Example 1 for the neutral d-tartaric acid salt 
          of d-lysergic acid diethylamide.</p>
        <p>What we claim is: </p>
        <p>The crystalline d-lysergic acid diethylamide which crystallizes from 
          benzene in prisms melting with decomposition at 80-85 degrees C., which 
          is difficulty soluble in water but easily soluble in methanol and in 
          ethanol, which possesses the specific rotation [alpha]20/D=+30 degrees 
          (c=0.4 in pyridine) and which corresponds to the formula C20H25ON3.</p>

          <hr>
          <p align="left">Patented February 28, 1956</p>
          <p align="left">Richard P. Pioch, Indianapolis, Indiana, assignor, to 
            Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, a corporation of Indiana. 
            No drawing. Application December 6, 1954, Serial No. 473,443. 10 Claims.</p>
          <p align="left">This invention relates to the preparation of lysergic 
            acid amides and to a novel intermediate compound useful in the preparation 
            of said amides.</p>
          <p align="left">Although only a few natural and synthetic amides of 
            lysergic acid are known, they possess a number of different and useful 
            pharmacologic properties. Especially useful is ergonovine, the N-(1(+)-1-hydroxyisopropyl) 
            amide of d-lysergic acid, which is employed commercially as an oxytocic 
            agent.</p>
          <p align="left">Attempts to prepare lysergic acid amides amides by the 
            usual methods of preparing amides, such as reacting an amine with 
            lysergic acid chloride or with ester of lysergic acid, have been unsuccessful. 
            United States Patents No. 2,090,429 and No. 2,090,430, describe processes 
            of preparing lysergic acid amides and, although these processes are 
            effective to accomplish the desired conversion of lysergic acid to 
            one of its amides, they are not without certain disadvantages.</p>
          <p align="left"> By my invention I have provided a simple and convenient 
            method of preparing lysergic acid amides, which comprises reacting 
            lysergic acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride to produce a mixed anhydride 
            of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids, and when reacting the mixed 
            anhydride with a nitrogenous base having at least one hydrogen linked 
            to nitrogen. The resulting amide of lysergic acid is isolated from 
            the reaction mixture by conventional means.</p>
          <p align="left">The reaction of the lysergic and the trifluoroacetic 
            anhydride is a low temperature reaction, that is, it must be carried 
            out at a temperature below about 0 degrees C. The presently preferred 
            temperature range is about -15 C. to about -20 C. This range is sufficiently 
            high to permit the reaction to proceed at a desirably fast rate, but 
            yet provides an adequate safeguard against a too rapid temperature 
            and consequent excessive decomposition of the mixed anhydride.</p>
          <p align="left"> The reaction is carried out in a suitable dispersing 
            agent, that is, one which is inert with respect to the reactants. 
            The lysergic acid is relatively insoluble in dispersants suitable 
            for carrying out the reaction, so it is suspended in the dispersant.</p>
          <p align="left">Two gallons of trifluoroacetic anhydride are required 
            per mol. of lysergic acid for the rapid and complete conversion of 
            the lysergic acid into the mixed anhydride. It appears that one molecule 
            of the anhydride associates with or favors an ionic adduct with one 
            molecule of the lysergic which contains a basic nitrogen atom and 
            that it is the adduct which reacts with a second molecule of trifluoroacetic 
            anhydride to form the mixed anhydride along with one molecule of trifluoroacetic 
            acid. The conversion of the lysergic acid to the mixed anhydride occurs 
            within a relatively short time, but to insure a complete conversion 
            the reaction is allowed to proceed for about one to three hours.</p>
          <p align="left">The mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
            acids is relatively unstable, especially at room temperature and above, 
            and must be stored at a low temperature. This temperature instability 
            of the mixed anhydride makes it desirable that it be converted into 
            a lysergic acid amide without unnecessary delay. The mixed anhydride 
            itself, since it contains a lysergic acid group, also can exist in 
            the reaction mixture in large part as an ionic adduct with trifluoroacetic 
            anhydride or trifluoroacetic acid. It is important for maximum yield 
            of product that the lysergic acid employed in the reaction be dry. 
            It is most convenient to dry the acid by heating it at about 105-110 
            degrees C. in a vacuum of about 1 mm. of mercury or less for a few 
            hours, although any other customary means of drying can be used.</p>
          <p align="left"> The conversion of the mixed anhydride into an amide 
            by reacting the anhydride with the nitrogenous base, such as an amino 
            compound, can be carried out at room temperature or below. Most conveniently 
            the reaction is carried out by adding the cold solution of the mixed 
            anhydride to the amino compound or a solution thereof which is at 
            about room temperature. Because of the acidic components present in 
            the reaction mixture of the mixed anhydride, about five mols or equivalents 
            of the amino compound are required per mole or equivalent of mixed 
            anhydride for maximal conversion of the mixed anhydride to the amide. 
            Preferably a slight excess over the five mols is employed to insure 
            complete utilization of the mixed anhydride. If desired, a basic substance 
            capable of neutralizing the acid components present in the reaction 
            mixture, but incapable of interfering with the reaction, can be utilized. 
            A strongly basic tertiary amine is an example of such a substance. 
            In such case, about one equivalent of amino compound to be converted 
            to a lysergic acid amide, as well as any unconverted lysergic acid, 
            can be removed from the reaction mixture and can be re-employed in 
            other conversions.</p>
          <p align="left"> A preferred method for carrying out the process of 
            this invention is as follows:</p>
          <p align="left">Dry lysergic acid is suspended in a suitable vehicle 
            as acetonitrile, and the suspension is cooled to about -15 C. or -20 
            C. To the suspension is then added slowly a solution of about two 
            equivalents of trifluoroacetic anhydride dissolved in acetonitrile 
            and previously cooled to about -20 degrees C. The mixture is maintained 
            in a low temperature for about one to three hours to insure the completion 
            of the formation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
            acids.</p>
          <p align="left">The solution of the mixed anhydride is then added to 
            about five equivalents of the amino compound which is to be reacted 
            with the mixed anhydride. The amino compound need not be previously 
            dissolved in a solvent, although it is usually convenient to use a 
            solvent. The reaction is carried out with the amino compound or solution 
            of amino compound at about room temperature or below. The reaction 
            mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for one or two hours, 
            preferably in the dark, and the solvent is then removed by evaporation 
            in vacuo at a temperature which desirably is not greatly in excess 
            of room temperature. The viscous residue, consisting of the amide 
            together with excess amine and amine salts, is taken up in a mixture 
            of chloroform and water. The water is separated and the chloroform 
            solution which contains the amide is washed several times with water 
            to remove excesss amine and the various amine salts formed in the 
            reaction, including that of any unconverted lysergic acid. The chloroform 
            solution is then dried and evaporated, leaving a residue of lysergic 
            acid amide. The amide so obtained can be purified by any conventional 
            procedure.</p>
          <p align="left">Dispersants suitable for the purpose of this invention 
            are those which are liquids at the low temperatures employed for the 
            reaction and are of such an inert nature that they will not react 
            preferentially to the lysergic acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride. 
            Among suitable dispersants are acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, propionitrile, 
            and the like. Additional suitable agents will readily be apparent 
            from the foregoing enumeration. Of those listed above, acetonitrile 
            is preferred since it is non-reactive and mobile at the temperature 
            used, and is relatively volatile and hence readily separable from 
            the reaction mixture by evaporation in vacuo.</p>
          <p align="left"> A wide variety of nitrogenous bases such as amino compounds 
            can be reacted with the mixed anhydride to form a lysergic acid amide. 
            As previously stated, the amino compound must contain a hydrogen atom 
            attached to nitrogen to permit amide formation. Illustrative amino 
            compounds which can be reacted are ammonia, hydrazine, primary amines 
            such as glycine, ethanolamine, diglycylglycine, norephedrine, aminopropanol, 
            butanolamine, diethylamine, ephedrine, and the like.</p>
          <p align="left">When an alkanolamine such as ethanolamine or aminopropanol 
            is reacted with the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
            acids, the reaction product contains not only the desired hydroxy 
            amide but also, to a minor extent, some amino ester. These two isometric 
            substances arise because of the bi-functional nature of the reacting 
            alkanolamine. Ordinarily the amino ester amounts to no more than 25-30 
            percent of the total amount of reaction product, but in cases where 
            the amino group is esterically hindered, the proportion of amino ester 
            will be increased. The amino ester can readily be converted to the 
            desired hydroxy amide, and the over-all yield of the latter increased 
            by treating the amino ester, or the mixture of amide and ester with 
            alcoholic alkali to cause the rearrangement of the amino ester to 
            the desired hydroxy amide. Most conveniently the conversion is carried 
            out by dissolving the amino ester or mixture containing the amino 
            ester in a minimum amount of alcohol and adding to the mixture a twofold 
            amound of 4 N alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution. The mixture 
            is allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours, the alkali 
            is neutralized with acid, and the lysergic acid amide is then isolated 
            and purified.</p>
          <p align="left"> It should be understood that, as used herein, the term 
            "lysergic acid" is used generically as inclusive of any or all of 
            the four possible stereoisomers having the basic lysergic acid structure. 
            Isomers of the lysergic acid series can be separated or interconverted 
            by means known to the art.</p>
          <p align="left">This invention is further illustrated in the following 
            specific examples.</p>
          <h3 align="left">[Example One]</h3>
          <p align="left">Preparation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
            acids:</p>
          <p align="left"> 5.36 g. of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml. 
            of acetonitrile and the suspension is cooled to about -20 degrees 
            C. To this suspension is added a cold (-20 degrees C.) solution of 
            8.82 g. of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 75 ml. of acetonitrile. The 
            mixture is allowed to stand at -20 degrees C. for about 1 1/2 hours 
            during which time the suspended material dissolves, and the d-lysergic 
            acid is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
            acids. The mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an oil 
            by evaporating the solvent in vacuo at a temperature below about 0 
            degrees centigrade.</p>
          <h3 align="left">[Example Two]</h3>
          <p align="left">Preparation of d-lysergic and N,N-diethyl amide:</p>
          <p align="left"> A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid 
            and trifluoroacetic acid in 200 ml. of acetonitrile is obtained by 
            reacting 5.36 g. d-lysergic acid and 8.82 g. trifluoroacetic anhydride 
            in accordance with the procedure of example one. The acetonitrile 
            solution containing mixed anhydride is added to 150 ml. of acetonitrile 
            containing 7.6 g. of diethylamine. The mixture is held in the dark 
            at room temperature for about two hours. The acetonitrile is evaporated 
            in vacuo leaving a residue which comprises the "normal" and "iso" 
            forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide together with some lysergic 
            acid, the diethylamine salt of trifluoroacetic acid and like by-products. 
            The residue is dissolved in a mixture of 150 ml. of chloroform and 
            20 ml. of ice water. The chloroform layer is separated, and the aqueous 
            layer is extracted with four 50 ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform 
            extracts are combined and are washed four times with about 50 ml. 
            portions of cold water in order to remove residual amounts of amine 
            salts. The chloroform layer is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, 
            and the chloroform is evaporated in vacuo. A solid residue of 3.45 
            gm. comprising the "normal" and "iso" forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide 
            is obtained. This material is dissolved in 160 ml. of a 3-to-1 mixture 
            of benzene and chloroform, and is chromatographed over 240 g. of basic 
            alumia. As the chromatogram is developed with the same solvent, two 
            blue fluroescing zones appear on the alumina column. The more rapidly 
            moving zone is d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide which is eluted with 
            about 3000 ml. of the same solvent as above, the course of the elution 
            being followed by watching the downward movement of the more rapidly 
            moving blue fluorescing zone. The eluate is treated with tartaric 
            acid to form the acid tartrate of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide 
            which is isolated. The acid tartrate of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl 
            amide melts with decomposition at about 190-196 degrees centigrade.</p>
          <p align="left"> The di-iso-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide which remains 
            absorbed on the alumia column as the second fluroescent zone is removed 
            from the column by elution with chloroform. The "iso" form of the 
            amide is recovered by evaporating the chloroform eluate to dryness 
            in vacuo.</p>
          <h3 align="left">[Example Three]</h3>
          <p align="left"> Preparation of d-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl 
            amide:</p>
          <p align="left"> A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid 
            and trifluoroacetic acid is prepared from 2.68 g. of d-lysergic acid 
            and 4.4 g. of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride in 100 ml. of acetonitrile 
            by the method of Example One. This solution is added to 6:03 g. of 
            diethylaminoethylamine. The reaction mixture is kept in the dark at 
            room temperature for 1 1/2 hours. The acetonitrile is evaporated, 
            and the residue treated with chloroform and water as described in 
            Example Two. The residue treated comprising d-iso- lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl 
            amide is dissolved in several ml. of ethyl acetate, and the solution 
            is cooled to about 0 degrees centigrade, whereupon di-iso-lysergic 
            acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide separates in crystalline form. The 
            crystalline material is filtered off, and the filtrate reduced in 
            volume to obtain an additional amount of crystalline amide. Recrystallization 
            from ethyl acetate of the combined fractions of crystalline material 
            yields d-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide melting at about 
            157-158 degrees centigrade. The optical rotation is as follows:</p>
