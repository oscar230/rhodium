 <H3>Introduction</H3> 

<p>Benzodiazepines is a large class of compounds, used as sedatives, anxiolytics and/or skeletal muscle relaxants. They have a good therapeutic window, low 
toxicity and a wide variety of pharmacological profiles. The first synthesized benzodiazepine was Librium or  Chlordiazepoxide, and it was discovered 
serendipiously by L. Sternbach and E. Reeder,  when they submitted a sample of what they thought could be an antibiotic, that they were going to throw out 
anyway during a spring cleaning. But they determined the structure of the compound errorneously, it had rearranged itself to Librium during the synthesis.</p>

<p>One of the benzodiazepines that came shortly after Librium was Diazepam, commonly  sold under the trade name Valium, and it is is your typical 
benzodiazepine. It can be  synthesized relatively easily in around 50% yield from the commercially available  starting material 5-chloro-isatoic anhydride 
as can be seen below [1].</p>

<h4><font color="blue">Diazepam synthesis I</font></h4>  

<h5>5-Chloro-N-methyl-isatoic anhydride[1,2]</h5>  

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam1.gif">

<p>To a solution of 13 grams of 5-chloro-isatoic anhydride in 120ml of dimethylformamide, 7 grams of anhydrous sodium  carbonate and 18 grams of methyl 
iodide was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 20h at room temperature, and then  poured into 700 ml of water to give crude 
N-methyl-5-chloro-isatoic anhydride. Recrystallization from acetic acid gave 85% yield of product melting at 201-203�C.</p>

<h5>7-Chloro-1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione[1]</h5>   

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam2.gif"> 

<p>A mixture of finely ground 5-chloro-N-methylisatoic anhydride (5.19 g), 2.25g of glycine, 4.15 ml of triethylamine. and 30 ml of  water was stirred at 
room temp for 5 hours. All solid material had disappeared after 3.5-4 h. Voilatile material was removed as  completely as possible on a rotavap and the 
residue treated with 60 ml glacial acetic acid and heated to reflux for 4.5 hours. After the mixture cooled, as much acetic acid as possible was removed 
on the rotary evaporator, and the tan oily residue was  treated with 30 ml of ether. On brief swirling of the mixture, crystallization set in, and the 
colorless crystalline materiual  was collecting after standing overnight and was washed with ether (4.60g, mp 176.5-178�C). The etheral filtrate (two 
phases) was  diluted with enough ethyl acetate to render it homogenous, washed twice with dilute sodium carbonate, then with water, filtered through 
anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated. Recrystallization of the crystalline residue (0.53g) gave 0.43 g of product,  mp 177-179�C. Total yield 5.03g 
(91.8%).</p>  

<h5>4-Acetyl-7-chloro-1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione[1]</h5>  

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam3.gif"> 

<p>A mixture of 1.0 gram of 7-Chloro-1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione (compound 2 above), and 3 ml of acetic  anhydride was heated to 
reflux in a craig tube for 2.5 h. The original suspension went into solution more or less rapidly, and after about 1h crystalline material began to 
separate, and was cooled, allowed to stand overnight, and collected. 1.12g (94%) of colorless prismatic blades, mp 207-208.5�C.</p>

<h5>5-Chloro-2-(glycylmethylamino)-benzophenone[1]</h5>   

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam4.gif"> 

<p>A suspension of 483mg (1.82mmol) finely ground 4-Acetyl-7-chloro-1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5- dione (from  experiment 3 above) in 12 ml 
of THF, freshly freshly refluxed with and distilled from LiAlH4, was treated slowly over 20 min  under stirring with 1.00ml (2.18 mmol, 1.2 equiv) of 2.18 N
commercial (Fisher) phenylmagnesium chloride at room temp (15-18�.   During the addition the tip of the delivery syringe was kept below the surface of the 
stirred solution. During the addition the  solution becomes deep red, and the suspended material goes into solution. Stirring was continued for 1.5h after 
the addition was complete, during which the color lightens to a clear bright yellow. The reaction mixture was treated with ammonium chloride  solution and 
extracted four times with CH2Cl2, the extracts were filtered through anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated, and the  residue was pumped out at 100�C and reduced 
pressure to give 684 mg of yellow glass. This material consists predominantly of the  product benzophenone with small amounts of the starting material, in 
a ratio 10.8:1 as determined by HPLC; in other runs the  ratio varied between 7:1 and 10:1.</p>

<h5>5-Chloro-2-(glycylmethylamino)-benzophenone oxime[1]</h5>  

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam5.gif"> 

<p>Crude 5-Chloro-2-(glycylmethylamino)-benzophenone from experiment 4 above (568 mg) and 485mg hydroxylamine hydrochloride were  heated in 10ml of pyridine 
under N2 in a bath maintained at 70�C for 45 hours. The pyridine was removed as completely as possible  on a rotovap, and the residue taken up in an 
etheral solution of 3% HCl, the layers were separated, and the ether layer was  extracted three more times with 3% HCl. The combined acid extracts was 
washed four times with CH2Cl2, the CH2Cl2 backwashed once with 3% HCl, and the combined 3% HCl extracts made basic with excess ammonia. The liberated basic 
material was taken into CH2Cl2  (four extractions), filtered through anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated and pumped out to yield 259 mg of nearly colorless 
glass,  which spontaneously crystallized; mp 202-204�C. The original ether raffinate and the CH2Cl2 washes of the 3% acid solution was  combined, filtered 
and concentrated to yield 248mg of a yellow glass whose TLC showed it to contain quite a bit of unchanged ketone. It was heated under N2 with 210 mg of 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 7 ml of pyridine at 70�C for 43.5 hours as above. A similar  workup yielded 106 mg more oxime, mp 201-203.5�C and 122 mg of 
acid-insoluble material. The oxime, when crystalline is very sparingly soluble in most organic solvents. After several recrystallizations from methanol, 
colorless crystals with a mp of 212-213�C was  obtained. </p>

<h5>Diazepam[1]</h5>  

<p><img src="pictures/diazepam6.gif"> 

<p>378 mg of the crude product obtained in experiment 6 above was refluxed for 12 h with 1.13 g of NaHSO3 in a mixture of 15ml of  alcohol and 7.5 ml of 
water. Most of the alcohol was removed under vacuum, and the residue treated with ether and 3% HCl. The ether  layer was washed three more times with 3% 
HCl, and then the combined acid fractions were extracted five times with CH2Cl2. The extracts  were filtered through anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. 
The orange-yellow residue (303mg, 89.3% after thorough drying) crystallized  readily on seeding with diazepam, and had a melting point of 129-131.5�C.</p>

<h5>Diazepam (alternative route from compound 4)[1]</h5>  

<p>502 mg of crude 5-Chloro-2-(aceturoylmethylamino)-benzophenone (product from experiment 4) was dissolved in 25 ml of methanol and  treated with 100% 
H2SO4 under reflux for 3.25h. Most of the methanol was removed under vacuum, and the residue was taken up in a mixture of 25 ml water and 25ml of ether. 
The layers were separated, and the ether layer was washed three times with a 3% HCl solution, and the  combined aqueous layers was made basic with ammonia 
and extracted four times with methylene chloride. The extracts were washed with a  small amount of water, filtered through anhydrous Na2SO4, and 
concentrated to give 264 mg of a pale yellow glass. This residue was taken  into about 2-3 ml of alcohol and treated with 60% perchloric acid until acid 
to congo red. Crystallization of the sparingly soluble  Diazepam Perchlorate begins almost at once. It is filtered and wased with a little alcohol. 
Yield 255mg (52.5%). The perchlorate was  converted to the freebase by distributing between methylene chloride and dilute ammonia (three extractions with 
CH2Cl2). The washed,  filtered and concentrated organic extracts yielded 191mg of very pale yellow glass which crystallized readily; mp 130-131.5�C. </p>

<h5>2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone[3]</h5> 

<font color="red">Under Construction!</font>  

<h5>2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone alpha/beta-oxime[4]</h5>  

<p>A mixture of 200g of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (compound 1 above), 100g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 1 liter of alcohol was  stirred under reflux 
for 22h. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum to a small volume, diluted with water and neutralized with sodium  carbonate. Benzene was then added, 
and the stirring was then continued until a considerable amount of crystalline precipitate had formed. Some petroleum ether was added, and the mixture 
was filtered. The crude alpha-oxime (139g, mp 150-160�C) remaining in the funnel was  washed with benzene and petroleum ether. After recrystallization 
from a mixture of ether and petroleum ether, it forms colorless prisms  melting at 164-167�C.</p>

<p> The aqueous layer of the filtrate was separated and discarded. The organic solution was dried, concentrated in vacuum, and the residue  taken up 
in ether. The ether solution was filtered, diluted with petroleum ether and kept at 0�C for 20h. The precipitated crystals, a mixture of the isomers (42g, 
mp 119-122�C), was filtered off. A third crop of crystals was obtained from the mother liquors after  concentration to a sirup. It consisted of 8g of 
prisms melting at 127-130�C. This product can be recrystallized from ether/petroleum  ether to form pure beta-oxime, mp129-132�C. The total yield of 189g 
(both alpha- and beta-oximes)corresponds to 89%.</p>

<h5>2-Amino-5-chlorobenzophenone beta-oxime (from the alpha oxime)[5]</h5>  

<p>A solution of 20 grams of 2-Amino-5-chlorobenzophenone alpha-oxime (compound 2 above) in 150 cc of formic acid (98-100%) was refluxed  for 3h, 
concentrated under vacuum to a small volume and neutralized with cooling with 3N NaOH. The precipitated quinazolide 3-oxide was filtered off and dissolved 
in 100ml of alcohol, and after the addition of 40 ml 3N NaOH the solution was refluxed for 15min. The  solution was then partly concentrated in vacuum, 
and the beta-oxime precipitated by the addition of dry ice (solid CO2). It was extracted with ether and crystallized by partial concentration. It formed 
prisms (7.7g) melting at 129-132�C.</p>

<h5>2-Chloroacetamido-5-chlorobenzophenone beta-oxime[5]</h5>          

<p>Into a stirred, cooled (10-15�C) solution of 26.2g (0.1 mole) of 2-Amino-5-chlorobenzophenone beta-oxime (compound 3 above) in 150 cc of  dioxane were 
introduced in small portions 12.4g (0.11 mole) of chloroacetyl chloride and an equivalent of 3N sodium hydroxide. The  chloroacetyl chloride and sodium 
hydroxide solution were introduced alternately at such a rate as to keep the temperature below 15�C and  the mixture neutral or slightly alkaline. The 
reaction was completed after 30 min. The mixture was then acidified with HCl, diluted with  water and extracted with ether. The ether extract was dried 
and concentrated under vacuum. Upon the addition of ether to the oily residue,  the product crystallized in colorless prisms melting at 166-167�C. The 
yield was about 50%.</p>

<h5>7-Chloro-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one 4-oxide[5]</h5>     

<p>To a solution of 6.4g (20 mmol) of 2-Chloroacetamido-5-chlorobenzophenone beta-oxime (compound 4 above) in 60cc of dioxane was added  20 cc of 1N NaOH. 
After 15h, the mixture was diluted with ice cold 1N NaOH and extracted with ether. The ether extracts was discarded,  the alkaline solution acidified 
and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic solution was concentrated to a small volume, and  diluted with petroleum ether, yielding 3.1g (54%) 
of the title compound.</p>

<h5>7-Chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one 4-oxide[5]</h5>          

<p>To a stirred warm solution of 15 grams of 7-Chloro-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one 4-oxide (compound 5 above) in 700 cc of  methanol were added 
2.78 grams of sodium methoxide, and after 5 min, 5 cc of dimethyl sulfate. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 h,  concentrated in vacuum to a small 
volume, and dilute with ether and petroleum ether. The formed crystals (11g, 70%) were filtered and  washed with water. After recrystallization from 
acetone, colorless prisms melting at 188-189�C were obtained.</p>   

<h5>Diazepam[5]</h5>     

<p>A mixture of 3g of 7-Chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one 4-oxide (compound 6 above), 30 cc of chloroform and 1 cc of phosphorous 
trichloride was refluxed for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then poured on ice and stirred with an excess of 40% NaOH  solution. The chloroform 
solution was separated, dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was  dissolved in methylene chloride and was 
crystallized by the addition of petroleum ether yielding 1.8g (63%) of the crystalline reaction  product (mp 120-122�C). after recrystallization from 
a mixture of petroleum ether and acetone, the product formed colorless plates melting  at 125-126�C.</p>

<p>The same compound was also formed in almost quantitative yield by catalytic hydrogenation of compound 6 in methanol at atmospheric pressure (30-50�C) 
using Raney-Nickel as catalyst.</p>


<h4><font color="blue">Diazepam synthesis III [6]</font></h4> 

<p>Into a stirred, cooled (10'-15'C) solution of 26.2 g (0.1mol) of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone-�-oxime in 150 ml of dioxane were introduced
in small portions 12.4 g (0.11 mol) of chloroacetyl chloride and an equivalent amount of 3 N NaOH. The chloroacetyl chloride and NaOH were
introduced alternately at such a rate so as to keep the temperature below 15�C and the mixture neutral or slightly alkaline. The reaction was
completed after 30 minutes. The mixture was slightly acidified with HCl, diluted with water and extracted with ether. The ether extract was dried
and concentrated in vacuo. Upon the addition of ether to the oily residue, the product, 2-chloroactetamido-5-chlorobenzophenone �-oxime crystallized

<h3>2-Methylamino-5-chloro-benzophenone</h3>

<p>Dissolve 400 g sodium hydroxide in 4 L ethanol and in a seperate flask, 1.5 moles (175.5 g) benzyl cyanide (see elsewhere on this site for its 
synthesis) and 1 mole 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene and the min. amoount benzene or toluene or THF to obtain a solid-free solution. Add dropwise this 
organic mixture to the NaOH in alcohol at 17-22�C (control by cooling), and leave the mix for 4 days. Pour on 3 kg ice and 12 L water (This mix now 
contains cyanide and must not be contaminated with acid!!!). Vacuum-filter (in portions) the resinous mass or decant off the water layer. Dissolve the 
water-washed resin in 1 L (or more, but loss) boiling isopropanol and let cool down to 10�C, after 1 day, filter the intermediate, 0.9 moles or about 
200 g 5-chloro-3-phenyl- benzo(2,1)-isoxazole.</p>

<p>A mix of 200 g benzisoxazole and 500 ml dimethyl sulfate (caution) is stirred 12 h at 80�C (4 L flask), and through the condenser thereafter, 
100 mL water and 2 L ethanol is added , then, direct to the flask, 100 g iron fillings. The flask content is mechanically stirred and over 90 min., 
600 mL conc. hydrochloric acid is added. Then the mix is refluxed 90 min and filtered over Celite hot. The cake is washed with 1 L hot ethanol and the 
filtrate concentrated in vacuo to 500 mL. It is poured in 4 L water and 1 L dichloromethane is added until most is dissolved. The dichloromethane layer 
is seperated and reextracted with 1 L more dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts are filtered and evaporated to dryness to leave the 
2-methylamino- 5-chloro-benzophenone, cryst. From petrol ether, mp 95-98�C. Yield 180 g.</p>
