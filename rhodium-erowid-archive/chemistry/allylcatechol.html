<h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Attempts have been made to synthesize 4-allylcatechol, the non-toxic antioxidant present in betel leaf. The catechol 
monoallyl ether on Claisen rearrangement gives both the 3- and 4-allylcatechols in 55 and 45% yields respectively. 
Photochemical rearrangement of catechol monoallyl ether in isopropanol solution under ultraviolet light for 120 h gives 
3- and 4-allylcatechols, each in 25% yield. In Claisen rearrangement, the anomalous behaviour, i.e. migration of 
allyl group to the <i>para </i>position when an <i>ortho </i>position is free, has been explained on the basis of the 
simultaneous progress of the reaction by both the normal <i>ortho </i>and the abnormal <i>para </i>migration.</p>
</div>

<p>In an earlier communication<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> from this laboratory it was reported that hydroxychavicol 
(4-allylcatechol) isolated from betel leaf <i>(Piper betle </i>Linn.) is a powerful antioxidant for fats. Being present in 
a condiment which is eaten in India and other parts of Asia for centuries it has since long been considered as non-toxic 
and, therefore, ideal for use in edible fats. Moreover, amongst a number of catechol derivatives tested<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> 
4-allylcatechol exhibited the maximum antioxidant activity. 4-Allylcatechol has been synthesized earlier<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>3-5</sup></a> 
by preparing the allyl ether of catechol and subjecting it to Claisen rearrangement. In all cases both mono- and diallyl ethers 
of catechol were formed. The catechol monoallyl ether on rearrangement gave 3- and 4-allylcatechols while the diallyl ether 
gave only 3,6-diallylcatechol. As the utility of 3-allylcatechol and 3,6-diallylcatechol as antioxidants for edible fats was 
limited due to their lower antioxidant index<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> as well as their doubtful toxicity, it was considered worthwhile to 
explore alternative methods of synthesizing 4-allylcatechol in which no isomers are formed.</p>

  <p>A modification of the earlier methods made it possible to completely avoid the formation of catechol diallyl ether. 
However, the catechol monoallyl ether on Claisen's rearrangement still yielded the 3- and 4-allylcatechols in 55 and 45% yields respectively.</p>

<p>It is well known that under Claisen rearrangement the allyl group migrates to an <i>ortho </i>position when even one 
unsubstituted <i>ortho </i>position is present, and to <i>para </i>position when both <i>ortho </i>positions are blocked. 
However, in the case of monoallyl ether of catechol, the allyl group migrates to the <i>para </i>position despite the 
availability of an unsubstituted <i>ortho </i>position. This anomalous behaviour, according to Tarbell<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>, is 
exhibited by derivatives of polyhydroxybenzenes. The <i>ortho </i>Claisen rearrangement occurs by an intramolecular 
cyclic mechanism.</p>

</div>

  <p>The unstable ketonic form of <i>o</i>-allylphenol (<strong>II</strong>) is produced as an intermediate, which spontaneously enolizes to 
the stable phenolic form (<strong>III</strong>)<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>7,8</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>para </i>Claisen rearrangement, which occurs when both <i>ortho </i>positions are substituted, begins in the 
same manner as migration to the <i>ortho </i>position and takes place in two stages.</p>

  <p>The intermediate cyclohexadienone (<strong>V</strong>) cannot be stabilized by passing over to a phenolic system and hence the 
allyl group continues to move to the <i>para </i>position with the formation of a new cyclohexadienone (<strong>VI</strong>) which 
immediately changes over to the stable phenol (<strong>VII</strong>)<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>9-14</sup></a>.</p> <p>Though the <i>ortho </i>and <i>para </i>Claisen rearrangements have been studied so thoroughly, no explanation is 
available in literature for the anomalous behaviour of allyl ethers of mono-<i>ortho</i>-substituted 
polyhydroxybenzenes. The postulation (Chart <strong>1</strong>) is an attempt to explain this anomaly. It can safely be presumed 
that a part of the rearrangement proceeds counter-clockwise by the <i>ortho </i>mechanism as for catechol 
monoallyl ether, thereby yielding the expected 3-allylcatechol (<strong>VIII</strong>).</p>
  <p>Simultaneously, under the activating influence of the <i>ortho </i>hydroxyl group, a parallel rearrangement (Chart <strong>2</strong>) 
proceeds in the counter direction, i.e. by first forming an intermediate with the <i>ortho </i>hydroxyl group, thus giving rise 
to cyclohexadienone (<strong>X</strong>), which rearranges to the new cyclohexadienone intermediate (<strong>XI</strong>), and finally to 
1,2-dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene (4-allylcatechol) (<strong>XII</strong>) as shown in equation. In other words, part of the rearrangement takes 
place by the expected <i>ortho </i>mechanism and the other part simultaneously by the <i>para </i>mechanism.</p>

<p>As this method of preparing 4-allylcatechol would always afford in addition the 3-allylcatechol, other alternative methods were tried.</p>

<p>Attempts to demethylate eugenol to obtain 4-allylcatechol in one step were made. The demethylating agents 
used were hydriodic acid, pyridine hydrochloride, anhydrous aluminium chloride, sulphuric acid and potassium hydroxide<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>15</sup></a>. 
However, in each case a polymerized product was obtained.</p>

<p>In the presence of boron trifluoride-acetic acid, guaiacol allyl ether rearranges at 68&deg;C, and a <i>para</i>-allyl 
migration takes place, in spite of the fact that an <i>ortho </i>position is free<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a>, some of the byproducts 
obtained being guaiacol, 6-allyleuginol allyl ether of allylguaiacol, etc.<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>16</sup></a>. It was hoped 
that catechol allyl ether, when rearranged under these conditions, should yield 4-allylcatechol and the byproduct formation 
could be minimized by adding catechol to the system. Contrary to expectations, under these conditions, the byproduct 
formation happened to be the major reaction. Other boron trifluoride-catalysed reactions like condensation of allyl 
alcohol to catechol in various solvents, allyl bromide to catechol, etc., all failed because of polymerization.</p>

  <p>Kharasch <i>et al.<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>17</sup></a> </i>have pointed out that under the influence of ultraviolet light and in the presence 
of solvents like isopropanol, phenyl allyl ether and phenyl benzyl ether rearrange to give <i>p</i>-allylphenol and 
<i>p</i>-benzylphenol respectively, although under the thermal rearrangement (Claisen) only the <i>ortho</i> isomers are 
obtained. Schmid and Schmid<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>18</sup></a> have shown that in the photochemical rearrangements, the reaction proceeds 
by the dissociation and recombination mechanism. With a view to study the behaviour of catechol monoallyl ether 
under photochemical rearrangement conditions, it was dissolved in isopropanol and irradiated with ultraviolet light up 
to 120 hr. On working up and distillation, 4-allylcatechol in a maximum yield of 25% together with 
3-allylcatechol in nearly the same amount (the rest being unreacted ether) were obtained. The gas-liquid chromatogram of 
the total reaction product did not reveal the presence of any other substance.</p>

  <p>Polyphosphoric acid, an effective dehydrating agent, is also a mild condensing reagent. Generally it does not undergo a 
violet reaction with hydroxylic compounds<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>19</sup></a>. Because of these properties it has been used for acylations 
of phenols<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>20</sup></a> and phenol ethers<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>21</sup></a>. The acyl group goes preferentially to the <i>para</i>
position to the hydroxyl group. Hence, it was decided to condense acrylic acid with catechol using polyphosphoric 
acid to get acryloyl catechol and then preferentially reduce the carbonyl group without affecting the double bond by 
using some of the newer reducing agents. Though acryloyl catechol was formed in 25% yield, all attempts to reduce 
it to 4-allylcatechol were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Thus despite varied attempts to synthesize 4-allylcatechol exclusively, it has not been possible to obtain the 
required isomer only by any of the methods tried.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

    <p><strong><i>Catechol monoallyl ether </i></strong>&#151; To stirred catechol (44 g.; 0.4 mole), dry acetone (125 ml.) and freshly fused potassium carbonate (24.5 g.; 0.35 mole), allyl bromide (26 ml.; 0.3 mole) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 hr, acetone recovered and the product cooled and filtered. From the residue consisting of unreacted catechol, potassium carbonate and potassium bromide, catechol (9.9 g.) was recovered by extraction with ether. The filtrate was dissolved in ether, acidified and washed free of acid. It was dried, concentrated and distilled when catechol monoallyl ether (40 g.; yield 88.9%); bp 80-82&deg;C/0.8-1.2 mm.; <i>n<sup>30</sup><sub>D</sub> </i>1.5354 (lit.<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> bp 103-4.5&deg;C/8 mm.; <i>n<sup>21.3</sup><sub>D</sub></i> 1.5408) was obtained. No other fraction distilled over.</p>    
    <p><strong>3- <i>and 4-allylcatechols </i></strong>&#151; Catechol monoallyl ether (30 g.; 0.2 mole) was heated in nitrogen atmosphere to 200-5&deg;C (oil bath). A vigorous reaction ensued and the product changed colour to red. The temperature was maintained for 5 min. and then the product chilled in ice bath. Fractional distillation gave first fraction (13.5 g.) consisting of 3-allylcatechol; bp 110-12&deg;C/3 mm.; <i>n<sup>30</sup><sub>(D)</sub></i> 1.5600 (lit.<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> bp 132.8&deg;C/9 mm.; <i>n<sup>30</sup><sub>(D)</sub> </i>1.5595) (Found: C, 71.8; H, 6.5; C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub> requires C, 71.98; H, 6.71%). A second fraction (bp 120-3&deg;C/2 mm.; <i>n<sup>30</sup><sub>(D)</sub> </i>1.5606; yield 11.8 g.) was also obtained. This was redistilled and crystallized from benzene-petroleum ether as colourless needles of 4-allylcatechol; mp 48-48.5&deg;C (lit.<a href="allylcatechol.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> mp 48.5&deg;C; bp 141-4&deg;C/7 mm.; <i>n<sup>29</sup><sub>(D)</sub> </i>1.5600). Both the allyl catechols gave deep green colour with ferric chloride solution.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Demethylation of eugenol </i></strong>&#151; Eugenol was demethylated by the following methods:<br>(<strong>i</strong>) Eugenol (10 ml.) petroleum ether (bp 100-20&deg;C; 100 ml.) and aluminium chloride (15 g.) were refluxed for 3 hr and the reaction product worked up as usual. A colourless solid (mp 104-5&deg;C) and a liquid (bp 108-15&deg;C/0.3 mm.); <i>n<sup>27.5</sup><sub>D</sub></i>1.5300) were obtained.<br>(<strong>ii</strong>) Pyridine hydrochloride and eugenol in equal amounts were heated to 150&deg;C for 3 hr, and the product worked up as usual. On distillation, a viscous liquid, bp 96-105&deg;C/1 mm., was obtained (methoxyl content: found 18.3, required for eugenol 18.9%).<br>(<strong>iii</strong>) Eugenol (10 g.), potassium hydroxide (30 g.) and absolute ethanol (325 ml.) were heated in an autoclave to 200&deg;C for 8 hr. On working up a brown coloured polymerized product was obtained.</p>

    <p><strong><i>4-Allylcatechol by ultraviolet irradiation </i></strong>&#151; Catechol monoallyl ether (30 g.) in isopropanol (50 ml.) was put in a quartz round-bottomed flask and irradiated for 120 hr by a 125 W. ultraviolet lamp in such a way that mild refluxing also took place. The product after the removal of the solvent was distilled to give the unreacted ether (14 g.), 3-allylcatechol (7.0 g.) and 4-allylcatechol (7.5 g.; 25% yield). The latter crystallized from benzene-petroleum ether in colourless needles; mp 48&deg;C; <i>n<sup>30</sup><sub>D</sub> </i>1.5600; its dibenzoyl derivative, colourless plates; mp 72&deg;C.</p>

    <p>GLC on a Griffin VPC apparatus (MK-IIA) with a katharometer as the detector did not show the presence of any other compound in the reaction mixture.</p>
    <p><strong><i>Synthesis of 4-allylcatechol using boron trifluoride as catalyst </i></strong>&#151; (<strong>i</strong>) Allyl alcohol (11.6 g.; 0.2 mole) was saturated with boron trifluoride at 0&deg;C. The complex formed (0.01 mole) was dissolved in dry ether (100 ml.) and catechol (0.01 mole) added. The mixture was then warmed and stirred for 2 hr. On working up a red coloured viscous mass was obtained, (<strong>ii</strong>) Boron trifluoride was passed into a solution of catechol (6.15 g.; 0.55 mole) and allyl alcohol (2.9 g.; 0.5 mole) in dry chloroform (100 ml.) at 0&deg;C. After some time the reaction became too violent and the mass polymerized, (<strong>iii</strong>) Boron trifluoride was passed to saturation in a solution of diacetoxy catechol (2.1 g.; 0.011 mole), allyl alcohol (0.58 g.; 0.01 mole) and chloroform 50 mL at 0&deg;C. The reaction was worked up after boiling in methanolic alkali for 30 min. A red coloured viscous liquid was obtained which on extraction and crystallization gave colourless needles; mp 120&deg;C. This shows that 4-allylcatechol was not formed, (<strong>iv</strong>) Catechol monoallyl ether (15 g.; 0.1 mole), boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex (0.5 ml.) and catechol (0.5 g.) were heated to 95&deg;C, with stirring, when an exothermic reaction took place and the internal temperature rose to 120&deg;C, and the colour changed to red. On working up and distillation a colourless liquid (4.3 g.), bp 92&deg;C/0.8 mm., was obtained; the rest of the mixture was a polymerized product.</p>
    <p><strong><i>Acryloyl catechol </i></strong>&#151; In a flask, phosphorus pentoxide (45 g.) and phosphoric acid (20 ml.) were mixed to a homogeneous mass, heated to 110&deg;C and catechol (5.5 g.; 0.05 mole) and acrylic acid (3.6 g.; 0.05 mole) were added to it all at once. After 10 min. of vigorous stirring, the reaction mixture was cooled and left overnight. Hydrochloric acid was added to it and the mass extracted with ether. The solvent layer was washed, dried and concentrated. The residue was extracted in boiling petroleum (60-80&deg;C). The extract was concentrated and distilled to give a first fraction (2.1g; 25% yield); bp 105-10&deg;C/1 mm.; n<sub>D</sub><sup>30</sup> 1.5368 and a second fraction; bp 160-70&deg;C/1 mm.; n<sub>D</sub><sup>30</sup><i> </i>1.4680. The first fraction showed unsaturation, and gave a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone; mp 189&deg;C.</p>

<p>All attempts to reduce the carbonyl group without affecting the adjacent double bond to give 4-allylcatechol were unsuccessful.</p>
