  <p>The literature records the reduction of two &beta;-nitrostyrenes to phenethylamines 
    by lithium aluminum hydride<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. We have found 
    that this method affords an excellent route to phenolic phenethylamines. For 
    the preparation of appreciable amounts of these compounds, none of the methods 
    so far described<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> has been found suitable.</p>

<p>4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-, 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy- and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamines were prepared from the corresponding &beta;-nitrostyrenes and 
isolated as their picrates in yields of 80%, 68% and 81%, respectively. The picrates were in turn converted to the stable hydrochlorides. In view 
of the amphoteric nature as well as the physical properties of the phenolic amines, this method of isolation was found very suitable.</p>

  <p>The required &beta;-nitrostyrenes were easily obtained by condensation of commercially 
    available phenolic aldehydes with nitromethane using methylamine<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3d</sup></a> 
    or ammonium acetate<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a> as condensing agents.</p>

<h3>Experimental<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a></h3>

<h4>4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-&beta;-nitrostyrene</h4>

<p>A mixture of 7g of methylamine hydrochloride, 10g of sodium carbonate and 100 mL of methanol was stirred well, filtered and added to a 
solution of 219 g of vanillin and 85 ml. of nitromethane in 600 mL of methanol. The solution was kept at room temperature in the dark for 72 
hours and the &beta;-nitrostyrene which crystallized out was collected and washed with cold methanol. The yield of yellow needles melting at 166-168°C 
was 225 g (81%); reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3d</sup></a> melting point 167-168°C.</p>

<br><h4>4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine</h4>

    <p>To a well-stirred mixture of 53 g. of lithium aluminum hydride and 2500 ml. 
      of absolute ether was added by the Soxhlet extractor technique<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> 55 g. of 
      4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-&beta;-nitrostyrene over a period of 59 hours. Stirring 
      and refluxing can be stopped and resumed at any time. The flask was cooled 
      well and 3000 mL of ice-cold 1.5 N sulfuric acid was added dropwise with 
      stirring. The water layer was separated and its pH adjusted to 6 with solid 
      lithium carbonate. The solution was heated to boiling. and the aluminum 
      hydroxide which precipitated was filtered off with the aid of filter-cel; 
      the clear, hot filtrate was mixed with a solution of 70g. of picric acid 
      in the minimum amount of hot ethanol. Upon standing overnight at room temperature. 
      89.2g (80%) of deep yellow needles of the picrate melting at 194-197°C was 
      obtained. Recrystallization from water raised the melting point to 198-199°C 
      (dec.); reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3d</sup></a> mp 198-199°C.</p>

    <p>A solution of 88 g of the picrate in 2 L of boiling water was mixed with 400 
      mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The picric acid which precipitated 
      on cooling was filtered, the filtrate was extracted with nitrobenzene and 
      then with ether. The aqueous solution was concentrated under reduced pressure 
      until crystals of the hydrochloride appeared. Thirty-six grams of tan crystals 
      melting at 211-213°C was collected. By evaporation of the filtrate to dryness 
      and recrystallization of the residue from methanol-ethyl acetate. another 
      4g was isolated. making a total yield of 90%. The pure salt melted at 213-214°C; 
      reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3a</sup></a> mp 210-211°C. The dibenzoyl derivative 
      prepared from the hydrochloride melted at 131-132°C; reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3b</sup></a> mp 129°C.</p>

<br><h4>3-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-&beta;-nitrostyrene</h4>

<p>This compound was prepared from 3.0 g. of isovanillin and 1.2 mL of nitromethane by the same procedure as described above. The mixture was 
allowed to stand for 50 hours, and an 87% yield of yellow needles, mp 156-159°C, was obtained. The product crystallized from methanol and 
melted at 161-162°C. Hahn and Rumpf<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3c</sup></a>, who prepared this compound in 40.6% yield using potassium hydroxide as condensing agent, reported a 
mp of 154°C.</p>

<br><h4>3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethylamine </h4>

<p>Using the same procedure as described above, 1.24 g of 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-&beta;-nitrostyrene was added over a period of 6 hours to 1.1 g 
of lithium aluminum hydride in 150 ml. of ether. The yield of picrate melting at 196-198°C (dec.) was 1.70 g (68%). After one recrystallization 
from water the picrate melted at 201-203°C (dec.) ; reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3c</sup></a> mp 203-204°C (dec.). The hydrochloride was obtained 
from the picrate as colorless needles mp 206-207° (from methanol-ethyl acetate).</p>

<br><h4>2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-<em>beta</em>-nitrostyrene</h4>

<p>A solution of 5.0 g. of freshly distilled 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2.5 ml. of nitromethane and 2 g. of ammonium acetate in 20 ml 
of glacial acetic acid was refluxed for 2 hours. The cooled dark mixture was poured into water and the gummy product allowed to crystallize. 
The crude solid was recrystallized from benzene, with the aid of Norit. The yield of yellow needles, melting at 115-122°C was 2.32 g (37%). 
The analytical sample melted at 129-130°C.</p>

<p>Using a methanolic solution of methylamine as condensing agent only 18% of the nitrostyrene was obtained after seven days. The reaction 
failed using potassium hydroxide as condensing agent.</p>

<br><h4>2-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine</h4>

<p>The yield of the picrate of the amine obtained from 1.0g of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-&beta;-nitrostyrene was 1.62 g (81%), mp 168-170°C; 
reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3b</sup></a> mp 170°C. The hydrochloride crystallized from methanol-ethyl acetate as colorless plates, mp 177-178°C; reported<a href="lah.phenolic.nitrostyrenes.html#refs"><sup>3b</sup></a> mp 175°C.</p>
