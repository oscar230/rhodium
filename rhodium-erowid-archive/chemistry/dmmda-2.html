<p>This is the result of much effort ,and the information is as accurate as I can remember. I am sure the colors are correct, and that the times, amounts, 
etc, are reasonably accurate, I didn't have true scales.</p>

<p><b>The amounts</b></p>

<ul>
<li>25 g dillapiole
<li>240 ml DMSO
<li>18g 93% H2SO4
<li>56g NaBr 99%
</ul>

<p>The DMSO was frozen solid and removed from icebox. Chilled H2SO4 was added to the DMSO chunk. This heats up a little and liquifies, somewhat, the DMSO. 
Swirl. Add the NaBr and swirl or stir if you have a good enough (BIG) stirbar. Chopping thru the salt is tough.</p>

<p>With vigorous stirring, the dillapiole is dripped into the DMSO/H2SO4/NaBr mixture, which btw, is now sodium sulfate, and in situ formed HBr.</p>

<p>The rate is a slow one, taking about an hour to get it all in, keeping it cool in a bath. The mixture , before adding dillapiole, is yellow-orange. The
addition of dillapiole decolorizes the mess and then begins a slow progression through the pukey-green, to yellowish, to the legendary burgundy. Really, 
its just a really dark yellow. Maybe with a orangishness. With proper stirring this takes 24 Hrs. It must always stay cool and stay stirring.</p>

<p>Then add 1L ice-water, decant, and the bromo-dillapiole (a heavy orange syrup) doesn't need to be distilled, it is good enough for the next stage. 
The yield was about 70%</p>

<p><b>Finkelstein Swap</b></p>

<p>Measure out an equimolar amount of Sodium iodide, add 5% to that, and suspend your bromo-dillapiole in acetone. Heat it, and as it approaches reflux, 
carefully add small amounts of the iodide salt to mixture. It darkens, and the reaction is a very visual one, and a very malodourous one, as iodine 
stinks nicely. Reflux gentle for 30 min (90% yield)!</p>
                    
<p><b>Delepine reaction</b></p>

<p>Put the undistilled iodo-dillapiole in 10x amount of alcohol in a 500ml RB flask, heat and begin adding slight molar excess of hexamine until all is in.
Refluxing this for 6 hours gave an eventual yield of DMMDA-2 which is quite rewarding. No one should doubt the power of delepine!</p>

<p><b>The workup:</b></p>

<p>Add HCl until the ph is 2, and filter off the ass-load of formed ammonium chloride</p>

<p>The red liquid is evaporated until a mass of hard rocklike crystals remained. This is impure DMMDA-2. The crystals CANNOT be cleaned, with ether or any 
other washes. Freebase and distill to give clear, off colored DMMDA-2.</p>

<p>The yield is 50% from the beginning. SWIM got ~12 g at the end.</p>
