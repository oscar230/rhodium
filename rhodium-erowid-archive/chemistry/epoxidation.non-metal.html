<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>An easy method for epoxidation of olefins using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) and either a stoichiometric or
catalytic amount of bromide ion has been developed. Without any transition metal catalyst a variety of
non-activated olefins give epoxides in high yields and good selectivity at ambient conditions.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Oxidation reactions of olefins to give epoxides are of major importance for organic synthesis. Nowadays,
especially asymmetric epoxidation reactions are in the focus of methodological developments<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, the
synthesis of racemic epoxides is still important on laboratory as well as industrial scales. A convenient
method for the synthesis of epoxides is the oxidation of olefins with hydrogen peroxide or alkyl peroxides in
the presence of transition metal complexes<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, in general the activity of the catalyst is limited and
the metal catalyst as well as modifying ligands have to be separated after the reaction. Nevertheless,
significant advances have been made in non-asymmetric metalcatalyzed epoxidation reactions in the last
decade<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a>. Especially noteworthy with respect to simplicity and catalyst productivity was the development of
redox active polyoxometalates (POM's) in combination with phase transfer active agents as catalysts in
combination with hydrogen peroxide. </p>

<p>More traditionally, epoxides are synthesized by the reaction of olefins with hydrogen peroxide in the
presence of acetic or formic acid<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. This convenient method involves the <em>in situ</em> formation of the
corresponding peracid, which easily undergoes epoxidation reaction. A drawback of this method are potential
side reactions of the acid. Hence, the method is only of limited use for acid-labile olefins or epoxides. An
alternative cheap and practical oxidant is bleach (sodium hypochlorite), which might be used either directly
or is produced <em>in situ</em> from chlorine under basic conditions. Although <em>in situ</em> generated hypochlorite is still
used in the two-step commercial process for propylene epoxide (<strong>Scheme 1</strong>)<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a>, comparably few studies described
the direct epoxidation of non-activated olefins with hypochlorite without metals being present<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Some time ago we became interested in the improvement of known oxidation reactions of olefins. After having
developed a new osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation reaction using air as terminal oxidant<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a>, we studied
selective alcohol oxidation reactions<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> and the catalytic dihydroxylation in the presence of sodium
hypochlorite<a href="epoxidation.non-metal.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> as oxidant. Based on this work, we turned interest to epoxidation reactions applying sodium
hypochlorite. In this manuscript we describe a novel general method for the epoxidation of olefins using
sodium hypochlorite in the presence of a catalytic or stoichiometric amount of bromide ion.</p>

<h4>Results and Discussion</h4>

<p>While investigating the oxidation of alpha-methylstyrene in the presence of different metal catalysts and
sodium hypochlorite, we discovered that epoxidation to 2-phenyl-1-epoxypropane proceeds as a side-reaction
independent from the metal catalyst used (<strong>Scheme 2</strong>). </p>

<div class="pic right">

</div>

<p>After studying the available literature we were surprised that the direct epoxidation of non-activate
dolefins using sodium hypochlorite as oxidant has not been examined in more detail. Therefore, we decided to
take a closer look at this reaction. As shown in <strong>Table 1</strong> (Entry <strong>1</strong>) the reaction proceeds in 15% yield using
simple sodium hypochlorite in a biphasic mixture of water and <em>tert</em>-butyl alcohol at room temperature. We
thought that the in situ generation of the more active hypobromide will increase the epoxide yield. Indeed,
upon addition of 1.5 equiv. of KBr (with respect to sodium hypochlorite) the reaction proceeds smoothly within
2 h giving the corresponding epoxide in 90% yield at 25&deg;C. Longer reaction times lead to slight decomposition
of the desired product. The solvent system is of major influence for the outcome of the reaction. Using
tert-butyl alcohol or water alone, the epoxide is obtained only in 1-4%. Biphasic mixtures of organic solvents and
water give better results, however the yields with dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran are still comparably low
(ca. 30%). Mixtures of acetonitrile or <em>tert</em>-butyl alcohol and buffered water solution (pH=10.4) lead to the
best epoxide yield (up to 90%). Variation of the pH from 9.5-12.0 and changing the reaction time do not have
a significant influence on the reaction. In general, most of the reactions are finished after 0.5 h. Slightly
lower yields are obtained at pH 11.6 and 12. </p>

<p>Advantageously, the epoxidation reaction with sodium hypochlorite also proceeds in the presence of
catalytic amounts of bromide ions. The reduction of the amount of bromide ions from 1.5 equiv. to 0.2 equiv.
leads only to a slight decrease of epoxide. Further reduction of the bromide concentration results in lower
epoxide yield (46% at 0.05 equivalents of KBr). Next, we tested whether a combination of hydrogen peroxide and
bromide ions is also able to effect epoxidation reactions. However, no conversion of &alpha;-methylstyrene is
observed under these conditions. In order to get more information about the mechanism, we studied the
concentration-time dependence of the olefin and reaction products via GC. A >95% conversion of &alpha;-methylstyrene is observed within the first minute. At the same time 2-phenyl-2-hydroxy-1-propyl bromide is
formed in nearly 90% yield. This bromohydrin is converted immediately to the desired epoxide. While nearly 75%
of the desired epoxide is obtained within 5 minutes, a maximum yield of epoxide (83%) is seen in between 30
and 60 minutes. Next, we studied the scope and limitations of the procedure. Different types of olefins were
tested (Table 2). Aromatic olefins such as styrene, &alpha;-methylstyrene, &beta;-methylstyrene, p-chlorostyrene,
p-methoxystyrene, and 1-phenylcyclohexene give the corresponding epoxide in 70-93% yield (<strong>Table 2</strong>, entries
<strong>1-12</strong>). In general, the reaction is finished within 1 to 2 hours. Much longer reaction times can lead to slightly
lower yields due to subsequent decomposition of the epoxide. In case of aromatic olefins apart from the
desired epoxidation reaction small amounts of halogenation of the aromatic nucleus can be observed. In
addition, the 1,2-dibromo or 1,2-chlorobromo derivatives arising from halogen addition along the double bond
are detected. The slow increase in product selectivity with increased reaction time using &alpha;-methylstyrene
as substrate (<strong>Table</strong> <strong>2</strong>, entries <strong>3</strong> and <strong>4</strong>) arises from the slow hydrolysis of the byproduct 1,2-dibromo-2-phenylpropane.
This subsequent hydrolysis reaction is evident with all substrates forming benzylic bromides as
byproducts; e.g., all substituted styrenes. All reactions proceed also well in the presence of catalytic
amounts of bromide. However, the addition of 1.5 equiv. of KBr give slightly improved yields. Terminal
aliphatic olefins, e.g., 1-octene and butyl allyl ether need longer reaction times for complete conversion
(<strong>Table</strong> <strong>2</strong>, entries <strong>13</strong> and <strong>14</strong>, <strong>19</strong> and <strong>20</strong>). On the otherhand internal aliphatic olefins (5-decene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene)
show a fast conversion of the olefin, but epoxide formation needs longer times compared to the
aromatic olefins.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

</div>

<p>In summary, we have shown that various non-activated olefins can be converted to epoxides by using simply
sodium hypochlorite and bromide salt. It is surprising that this type of non-metal-catalyzed epoxidation has
been previously largely overseen. Aromatic olefins furnish the corresponding epoxide with high selectivity at
room temperature to 40�C in short time (<1-2h). Aliphatic olefins react somewhat more sluggishly. It is clear that the method described here is associated with the production of 1 equivalent of NaCl. Nevertheless, the procedure can be performed safely without any additional transition metals at ambient conditions. Further advantages of the procedure remain in the simplicity and the low-priced oxidant.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>General Information</h4>

<p>All reactions were carried out without any special precautions under an atmosphere of air. Chemicals and
solvents were purchased from Fluka and used as received. <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ARX
400 spectrometer. Gas chromatographic analyses were run on a Hewlett-Packard GC6890 series, HP 5, 5%
phenylmethyl siloxane, capillary (30m, 250&micro;m, 0.25&micro;m).</p>

<h4>General Procedure</h4>

<p>In a 100-mL Schlenk tube, KBr (357mg, 3.0 mmol or 47mg, 0.4 mmol, respectively), buffer (10mL, prepared by
adjusting a 0.5 molar solution of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> to a pH of 10.4 with a 2 molar NaOH solution), acetonitrile (10 mL),
substrate (2.0 mmol) and diethylene glycol di-<em>n</em>-butyl ether (100&micro;L, as internal standard for GC) were
added. The reaction mixture was warmed to 40&deg;C under 1000 rpm magnetic stirring using a thermostat. Aqueous
NaOCl solution (Fluka commercial sodium hypochlorite, 1.1 mL of a 12.4% solution, d=1.2 g&middot;mL<sup>-1</sup>, 1.1
equivalents) was added at once and stirring and temperature were maintained for 15 minutes to 24 hours
depending on the substrate (see Tables above). Then, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (0.5 g) was added and the mixture was extracted
with 20 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and analyzed by GC.</p>

<p>For isolation of the product, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the crude epoxide was purified by
column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate 10:1) or distillation.</p>
