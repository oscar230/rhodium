18gr of Palladium on Carbon were prepared using following methode:

- 1,7gr PdCl2 in 2ml 31% HCl and 20ml dH2O are heated for 15min at 80°
- 20gr activated carbon are heated with 450ml H2O and 15ml 31% HCl for 2h; 
  the carbon is filtered off
- the PdCl2 solution is added to 30gr sodium acetat trihydrate in 200ml 
  dH2O in a 500ml Flask
- the washed carbon is added to this solution
- hydrogenate the mixture for 3h, using drone's hydrogen generator; set 
  it up to produce 1mol of H2; don't forget to stir vigorously; iron 
  powder works nicely (only powder works, sheet's won't)
- when the hydrogenation is complete and the carbon settles down and you 
  should have a colorless mixture with the catalyst at the bottom
- filter the carbon , wash it with 4-5*100ml dH2O; dry the catalyst at 50°
- I got 18gr (my filter methode wasn't good, use only glas no plastic, 
  easier to clean) of 5% Palladium on Carbon;

- 22gr highly purified Phenyl-2-nitropropene
- 300ml 99% glacial acetic acid (maybe too much)
- 38gr Ammonium Formate
- 9gr 5% Palladium on Carbon ( Pd-C)

were introduced in a 500ml Flask.

22gr P2NP were dissolved in 300ml 99% glacial acetic acid and added 
to the 5% Pd-C. All was heated to 100° and vigorously stirred.
I introduced 3*~13gr Ammonium Formate; All was refluxed for 25 min;
Then everything was cooled; 100ml Chloroform were added so that it 
is easier to filter the Pd-C. I used normal coffee filter paper and 
vacuum, which worked. Then i added 1l of dH2O and the Chloroform 
separated out. The layers were separated andi "washed" again with 
additional 100ml Chloroform. But amphetamine wasn't soluble in the 
glacial acetic acid, so i extracted it with the chloroform.

The chloroform was eliminated and i got 15.5gr of a yellow oil, 
which was dissolved in 200ml 15% HCl, washed trhee time with 75ml
DCM, made basic with 25% NaOH and extracted with Ether. And again 
i failed to make the HCl salt , i tried to dry the ether with Epsom 
Salt and then to afford the salt with dry HCl. But all i got was a 
slightly yellow colored layer at the bottom of my ether mixture.
I decided then to make the salt with 99% H2SO4 in Ether and Ethanol, 
which worked perfectly. (first i made again everything basic...)
The salt was washed and i got 14gr of white! Amphetamine salt.

- - - - -

I didn't use any H2SO4 in the CTH because i don't know if it helps or if 
it destroys everything, maybe it helps and the yields would be higher. 
Maybe anhydrous ethanol works better, if anyone sends my Calcium oxide 
POWDER i will try it )

Palladium on carbon is not easy to handle, i suggest to use only glas 
filter funnels, my plastic funnel is still full with carbon.

Anyone knows a secure methode to form the HCl salt of an amphetamine ?
I dried with the Epsom Salt (~30gr) for 2h, is it not possible to dry 
with Epsom Salt (MgSO4 * 7H2O)? already too many H2O's ?

Excellent post! Most informative. Did your info on this reaction come from 
Tet Lett 29(45), 5733 (1988)? Any other refs?

I don't get this bit "But amphetamine wasn't soluble in the glacial acetic 
acid, so i extracted it with the chloroform." It isn't!? And you didn't 
basify the reaction mixture B4 extraction?

You had problems forming the HCl salt because it is hard to do. Much 
harder than meth HCl. Early papers on amphetamine synth. always described 
the HCl salt as hygroscopic, if they could even obtain it as a solid at 
all. Actually, when extremely pure it is not particularly hygroscopic. 

Epsom Salts are not a good drying agent. Cook in the oven for awhile to 
dehydrate first.

Don't skimp on the formate. Most of the dudes (below) are using 5 to 12 
mole xs. of Formate, w.r.t. main reactant, in their CTHs. This will give 
the best yield.

Was all the Pd homemade? I would have got hold of some of that Pd on 
polymer - it should last at least 50 reductions.

Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation Reactions are considered so easy that 
J. Chem. Ed. are flogging them for new undergrad. Programs. - get your 
ticket soon. Cheap, versatile - but not perfect. Ultra-cheapskates can 
even substitute Ni for Pd as the catalyst (sometimes)!

Alkenes -> alkanes
ketones -> alkanes
nitroalkanes -> amines
azides -> amines
chloro-cpds -> hydrocarbons (psssst halo-ephedrine -> meth)
deprotection of peptides
deprotection of benzylic ether (to alcohol)
nitro-alkene -> oxime

beagle boy, after the filtration of the Pd-C with 100ml i added 1l of 
dH2O. I separeted the two layers and "washed" again with 100ml Chloroform; 
Then i added enough 50% NaOH to the glacial acetic acid to make it basic 
and extracted it with DCM, when i evaporated the DCM i found only 1ml of 
yellow oil. When i eliminated the chloroform from the washes i got ~15gr 
of a yellow oil. This oil was then converted into the sulfuric salt.

Maybe the ammonium formate didn't let the amphetamine dissolve in the 30% 
acetic acid. When i made it basic i smelled ammonia too, maybe the ammonia 
was present and reduced the dissolve power of glacial acetic(made it basic?), 
boh, i am not a chemist, i am happy that i didn't loose my amphetamine oil. 

My information source for this reaction was the internet and vogel's book 
on practical organic chemistry...

- 0.05mol 8gr beta nitropropene C9H9NO2 63gr/mol
- 13gr 5% Pd-C
- 100ml Methanol
- 50ml THF 
- 0.15 mol NaBH4 

- 8gr P2NP are dissolved in 50ml THF and 50ml Methanol and is stirred on 
  a magnetic stirrer
- 1.9gr NaBH4 are slowly added over a period of 30min
- the addition of nabh4 is effervscent
- after 15min of stirring 13gr 5% Pd/C in 100ml methanol is added;
- don't add the Pd/C without solvent, it will catch fire )
- the you should add slowly over a period off 1h (i did it) 4 gr NaBH4;
- reaction is continued for another 3h and 5ml of acetic acid is added 
  (to neutralize NaBH4 .. maybbe you don't this) and 20ml of 31% HCl and 
  50ml of H2O;
- the solution turns red
- Pd/c is filtered away and washed with Methanol and dH2O
- Methanol and THF is eliminated, the red color disappears
- all is washed with DCM
- make it basic with 100ml 25%NaOH and extract; you should get around 5gr 
  of the freebase (i did), yield ~70%; the salt is easily made with H2SO4 
  in ethanol, but don't add too much H2SO4 or your salt dissolves (if 
  this happens make all basic and extract)

a few days bevor i tried the same thing with ethanol, yields were much 
lower and the addition of NaBH4 was not so effervescent

I would like to try to isolate the nitroalkane which is formed by the 
reduction with NaBH4 in methanol and reduce it with Al/Hg, i need to know 
if reduction of a nitroalkane with Al/Hg is sensible to water (will it 
work in 95% ethanol?) and how much Al/Hg for 0.1mol of P2NP i should use?
