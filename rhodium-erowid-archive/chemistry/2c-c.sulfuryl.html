<p>2,5-Dimethoxyphenylethylamine (1.81g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in 20ml glacial acetic acid in a 50ml beaker equipped with magnetic stirring and a thermometer, and placed in an ice-bath.
Sulfuryl chloride (2.0g, 1.20ml, 15 mmol) was added dropwise<sup><b>1</b></sup> to the solution over 30 minutes, the whole time keeping the temperature of the solution between
15-20�C<sup><b>2</b></sup>. When the addition was finished, the ice-bath was removed, and the solution allowed to warm up to room temperature (25�C) and stirred for another 90 minutes,
the temperature being monitored occasionally so that it didn't exceed 30�C. A too high reaction temperature causes partial dichlorination of the substrate, a temperature of 40�C during
the addition invariably causes side reactions.</p>

<p>When the mixture had reacted for a total of 2 hours, 20ml of dry diethyl ether was added, and the solution stirred at room temperature for another 30 minutes, followed by filtration of
the precipitated 4-Chloro-2,5-Dimethoxyphenethylamine Hydrochloride and washing with 15ml of dry ether, and air drying to give 0.54g of a white powder. The mother liquor was diluted with
an equal amount of dry ether and allowed to stand overnight in the fridge, giving a second crop of 0.74g 2C-C.HCl. The combined crops weighed 1.28g (51% yield) which were and dissolved in a
boiling mixture of 50ml acetonitrile and 5ml methanol, which after cooling somewhat was diluted with 30ml dry ether and placed in the fridge to fully crystallize to give 0.67g (27% yield)
of pure 4-Chloro-2,5-Dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-C) Hydrochloride after filtration, washing with  10ml ether and air drying. The recrystallization was very wasteful, and a different solvent
system should have been used. Reference [1] suggests methanol/ether.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<ol type="1">
<li>Sulfuryl Chloride is poisonous, and its vapors dissociate into Cl<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> gas. Use only in a well ventilated area, and preferably chill the bottle before use, as to minimize evaporation.
<li>If the reaction mixture is chilled too much, the acetic acid will solidify, so try to keep the temperature between 15-20�C and not below.
