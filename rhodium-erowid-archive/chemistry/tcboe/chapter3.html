        <H3>Ether [60-29-7]</H3>
        (aka,ethyl ether,diethyl ether)
        <P> Ether is hot on the DEA's list of suspect chemicals and is officially
          illegal to possess. It is relatively easy to produce if one has the
          proper work area to do it safely. Good ventilation (a fume hood) is
          a must to prevent dangerous concentrations of ether from building up
          in the air.
        <P> <A href="references.html#1">[1]</A>Place
          2 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 3 neck round bottom flask.
          Place a thermometer through a stopper (or glass thermometer holder)
          and into one of the flask's holes. Be sure the thermometer reaches into
          the sulfuric acid. Into a separatory funnel place 3 pounds of ethanol
          (190 proof). If your separatory funnel will not hold all of the ethanol
          just keep the funnel filles as the reaction proceeds. Use the final
          neck to set up a simple distillation apparatus. In the collection flask
          place ice to help condense the ether. Heat the sulfuric acid to 280�F
          (or 138�C). When this temperature is reached open the stopcock on the
          separatory funnel and allow a slow steady stream in. Do not allow the
          temperature to exceed 286�F (141�C) or ethene will begin to be produced
          instead of ether.
        <P><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="CENTER" src="pictures/picture1.gif"></CENTER>
        <P> Separate the ether from the ice water with a separatory funnel,wash
          with 10% sodium hydroxide solution, dry over calcium chloride for 24
          hours, and redistill the ether. Ether boils at 35C, density at 30�C--.7019,
          at 20�C---.7134.
        <P>
        <H4>Anhydrous Ether</H4>
        <P> Dry ether can be prepared by letting ether dry over thin slices of
          sodum metal (or sodium wire) for 24 hours. Use 5g of sodium for every
          100g of ether. Distill the ether over fresh sodium metal under inert
          atmosphere. To generally see how to set up your apparatus for inert
          atmosphere look under methylenation of 4-allyl catechol in <A HREF="chapter5.html">chapter
          five</A>. Instead of leading the nitrogen to the top of a reflux apparatus
          as shown, you would lead it into a distillation apparatus where the
          thermometer normally goes. You will also need to lead the nitrogen through
          a flask containing calcium chloride or other drying agent to remove
          moisture from the nitrogen before it enters the distillation apparatus.
          This all serves to keep the ether from reabsorbing moisture from the
          air. Stopper the receiving flask for storage of this dry ether.
        <H4>Peroxide Formation in Ether</H4>
        <P>In addition to the danger of explosions from the build up of ether
          vapors. Explosive peroxides that form from prolonged contact with oxygen
          in the air pose a significant risk to the chemist. Even air trapped
          inside the bottle will form significant amounts of peroxides in time;
          therefore, before using ether that has been stored over a period of
          time one should first test for peroxides and then treat the ether if
          necessary.
        <P> TEST A: .1g of sodium iodide is dissolved in 1 ml of glacial acetic
          acid and this solution added to 10ml of the ether to be tested. Formation
          of a red color due to free iodine formed indicates the presence of peroxides.
        <P> TEST B: 5ml of a 1% ferrous ammonium sulfate solution, .5ml of 1 N
          sulfuric acid, and .5 ml of .1 N ammonium thiocyanate are mixed. If
          color is present in the solution, it is decolorized by adding a trace
          of zinc powder. This is added to an equal amount of ether to be tested.
          If a red color develops peroxides are present.
        <P> REMOVING PEROXIDES: To 1 liter of ether, add 40g of a 30% aqueous
          ferrous sulfate solutions (12g of ferrous sulfate in 28g water). The
          reaction can be vigorous if appreciable amounts of peroxides are present.
          Separate the ether and dry it over calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate
          and distill.
        <P>
        <H4>OTC Ether</H4>
        <P> For those who don't care to synthesize ether, there is a readily available
          source in the automotive section of your local department store. Most
          people know it as starting fluid. The main component is diethyl ether.
          The current leading K-mart brand contains heptane(bp 98�), dimethyl
          propyl methane (2-methyl pentane, bp 60�), and diethyl methyl methane
          (3-methyl pentane, bp 63�) as added ingredients. The other ingredients
          all boil significantly higher than ether so the ether can be removed
          by distillation. To collect the ether for distillation, spray the contents
          of the can into a flask that is nestled in crushed ice (in a well ventilated
          area or outside). Once can use one of the "straws" tha comes with a
          can of WD-40 to spray the starting fluid contents well into the flask.
          Distill the liquid collecting the portion boiling up to 35�C.
        <P>
        <H3>Chloroform [67-66-3]</H3>
        <P> In a 1000ml flask, mix 300g of calcium hypoclorite (swimming pool
          chlorine) and 300ml of water.<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" src="pictures/picture2.gif">Mix
          thoroughly so that no chunks are left. To the separatory funnel add
          50g (63.5ml) of acetone. Acetone can be purchased in teh paint section
          of any store that sells paint.. Run water through the jacket of the
          condenser and set the receiving flask in an ice bath. Allow the acetone
          to slowly run into the reaction flask so that the tempereature does
          not rise above 45�C. Cool with a water bath if necessary. When all the
          acetone is added, heat the flask with a water bath to distill over the
          chloroform. It will distill over in the range of about 56-66�C. Wash
          the chloroform that distills over with an equal volume of water and
          then dry it overnight with calcium chloride. Finally, distill the chloroform
          (bp 61-62�C, density 1.48)<BR>
        <P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="pictures/picture3.gif"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
        <P> Chloroform can also be prepared by the following method.<BR>
          <A href="references.html#2">[2]</A>
          Mix 2 pounds of calcium hypochlorite (swimming pool chlorine), 12 pounds
          of water and 12 fluid ounces of ethanol in a suitable sized flask. Place
          this flask in a reflux apparatus. Heat with a water bath until no more
          chloroform is produced (chloroform will collect as a separate layer
          in the flask). Use a separatory funnel to separate the water from chloroform
          and redistill the chloroform.<BR>
        <H4>Decomposition in Chloroform</H4>
        <P> Chlorform decomposes under the influence of light, air, and moisture.
          After storage, it therefore contains phosgene (carbonyl dichloride,
          COCl2), HCl, chlorine and other chlorinated methane products. For this
          reason most purchased chloroform contains from 0.5 - 1.0% ethanol as
          a stabilizer. The ethanol will react first before any chloroform decomposes.
          The formation of phosgene and HCl can be represented as follows:<P>
          <CENTER>
            CHCl3 + H2O + O2 --> COCl2 + H2O2 + HCl
          </CENTER>
        <P>

        <H3>Formic Acid[64-18-6]</H3>
        (CHOOH)
        <P> <A href="references.html#3">[3]</A>
          Mix an equal amount of glycerine and oxalic acid and place in a flask.
          Heat this mixture at 75-90�C. Continue heating until no more CO2 bubbles
          out. Fresh oxalic acid is added and the process continued. When enough
          acid is made, distill it over using the proper apparatus and raising
          the temperature with an oil bath. 90% formic acid is collected. Alternatively,
          you can place the mixture in a distillation apparatus with a vacuum
          connection. Read the temperature with the thermometer placed into the
          mixture. Heat the mixture to ~90�C, but while under reduced pressure.
          As the reaction proceeds the formic acid will distill over. This takes
          about 4 to 5 hours for 500g of glycerine and 500g of oxalic acid.
        <P>
        <H3>Allyl Alcohol[107-18-6]</H3>
        <P> (based on 500g of glycerine and 500g of oxalic acid)<BR>
          <A href="references.html#4">[4]</A>
          Continue heating the mixture from the formic acid synthesis with an
          oil bath or Bunsen burner (if using a Bunsen burner heat the flask through
          wire mesh to spread the heat). Some liquid should come over before the
          temperature reaches 210�C. This liquid can be discarded since it contains
          mostly water and formic acid. When the temperature of the liquid reaches
          220-225�C carbon dioxide is rapidly evolved and allyl alcohol and allyl
          formate distill over in approximately equal amounts. Collect this distillate
          in a flask containing a few cubes of ice. Stop reactin when the temperature
          reaches 240�C. Heating beyond this temperature produces acrolein. Add
          50g of sodium hydroxide in 1L of water to the distillate. Let the mixture
          sit at room temperature for 12 hours. This will hydrolyze the allyl
          formate to allyl alcohol. Distill this mixture collecting the first
          300ml which come over. This contains the whole of the allyl alcohol.
          By careful fractional distillation a constant boiling mixture can be
          obtained which boils at 87-88�C. This solution contains 27-28% water.
          As an alternative to fractional distillation, 50grams of anhydrous potassium
          carbonate can be added to the 300ml and the heavier layer which forms
          is discarded.
        <P>
        <H4>Pure Allyl Alcohol</H4>
        <P> To the aqueous allyl alcohol solution is added 10g portions of anhydrous
          potassium carbonate. The heavier aqueous layer is removed with a separatory
          funnel. Continue this procedure until no layer separates and the potassium
          carbonate remains solid. Allow time to be sure no separate layer will
          form. Filter off the solid and collect all that distills between 94-97�C.
          The alcohol obtained is 90-98% pure.
        <P>
        <H3>Toluene</H3>
        <P> Toluene in its commercial grade is known as Toluol and is sold by
          the gallon and pint sizes in hardware stores as a paint thinner.
        <H3>Methylene Chloride[75-09-2]</H3>
        <P> Methylene chloride is the main component of paint strippers. These
          strippers also contains a reasonable amount of methanol that can be
          saved. They caome as a gelatinous substances because of a thickening
          agent present. If one distills the stripper, methylene chloride will
          be the first component to distill over, followed by methanol. The remaining
          residue is the thickening agent which will cling to the glassware. The
          thickener left can be scraped out with a coat hanger (methylene chloride bp 40�C/ methanol bp 65�C)
        <P>
        <H3>Ethanol</H3>
        <P> Ethanol is the common alcohol that we drink. Any alcoholic beverage
          could be distilled to produce this alcohol in a maximum concentration
          of 95% (vol/vol). To get any higher concentration you have to resort
          to other means. There is no need to distill alcoholic beverages, though,
          since 190 proof grain alcohol (95%) is available at the liquor store.
        <P>
        <H4>Anhydrous Ethanol[64-17-5]</H4>
        <P> To 1 liter of 190 proof grain alcohol is added 200g of calcium oxide.
          Calcium oxide is commonly called lime, but it should not be confused
          with the lime sold for agriculture which is calcium anbd magnesium carbonate.
          The mixture is refluxed for 24 hours in a reflux apparatus fitted with
          a calcium chloride tube to keep out atmospheric moisture. The alcohol
          is then distilled off. This results in 99% ethanol which is treated
          again with 35g of calcium oxide to yield 99.7% ethanol.<BR>
          For laboratory preparation of calcium oxide form calcium carbonate see
          <I>Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry</I>.
        <P>
        <H3>Hydrobromic Acid(48%) <A href="references.html#5">[5]</A></H3>
        <P> Hydrobromic acid is not as commonly available as the components it
          can be made from, namely sodium bromide and sulfuric acid. It's preparation
          is straight forward and a good quality constant boiling 48% solution
          can be obtained.
        <P>
          <CENTER>
            H2SO4 + KBr --> KHSO4 + HBr
          </CENTER>
        <P> 220g of KBr (potassium bromide) or 190g of NaBr (sodium bromide) is
          dissolved in 200ml of distilled water and chilled in an ice bath. 90
          ml of concentrated H2SO4 is chilled in the ice bath and then slowly
          added to the chilled bromide solution being sure not to allow the temperature
          to rise above 75�C, in order not to form any free bromine. The solution
          is cooled to room temperature and the K2SO4 that was formed is filtered
          out. The solution is then placed in a 1000ml boiling flask in a simple
          distillation apparatus. Add a few boiling chips. Start a flow of water
          through the condenser and heat with flame through a wire gauze. Water
          will distill over first, but when the temperature reaches 125�C replace
          the receiving flask with a clean flask. Monitor the temperature as it
          will continue to rise to 126�C and remain there steadily until the constant
          boiling solution has distilled over. When the temperature begins to
          drop stop the distillation. [It is important to know the correct temperature
          in order to collect the proper fraction. To calibrate the thermometer
          first boil water in the apparatus and note the temparature. If it reads
          100C, then the thermometer reads correctly. If it reads say 101�C, you
          should substract one degree when reading your thermometer. If it reads
          say 99C, you should add one degree when reading your thermometer.] Even
          purer HBr can be obtained by redistilling and collecting the portion
          boiling at 126C.<BR>
          The acid obtained is approximately 47.5% HBr with a density of 1.49g/ml.
        <P>
        <H3>Hydrogen Chloride Gas <A href="references.html#6">[6]</A></H3>
        <P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="pictures/picture4.gif"><BR>
          HCl gas can be easily generated with the apparatus shown. The still
          head (bent adapter) is stoppered with a one hole #2 rubber stopper with
          a glass tubing fitted in the hole. Vinyl or rubber tubing is then fitted
          to the glass tubing and finally to a longer piece of glass tubing (or
          pipette) that will reach into the receiving containter (not shown).
          The separatory funnel is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid and
          left unstoppered. The reaction flask is filled 1/4 of the way with table
          salt (sodium chloride) and made to a thick slurry by addition of water
          or if handy muriatic acid. Use less salt if only a small amount of gas
          is needed for the reaction. Be sure that the separatory funnel is clean
          so that any unused sulfuric acid can be returned to its container. Place
          the glass tube into the flask to receive the HCl. To start the gas generation,
          open the stopcock partway and allow a stream of sulfuric acid into the
          flask. Tilt the apparatus if necessary to prevent the sulfuric acid
          from entering the side-arm of the still head. Slow the flow of the sulfuric
          acid to a fast drip. The HCl first generated will flush out the air
          present before coming out full strength. Pressure will build up in the
          apparatus in proportion to the depth the glass tube is submersed in
          the flask receiving the HCl. Keeping this in mind, adjust the flow of
          the sulfuric acid so that a steady steam of bubbles exit the glass tube.
          If sulfuric acid is added too fast, gas will bubble up through the separatory
          funnel. As long as the solution that you are feeding HCl is not saturated
          with HCl it will continue to absorb gas and very little will actually
          escape. Without proper ventilation, it will become quite obvious when
          the reaction with HCl is complete and the solution saturated. At this
          point, stop the flow of sulfuric acid and lead the gas into a lye solution
          (sodium hydroxide). When no more gas is produced, carefully dilute the
          contents of the reaction flask and discard down the drain with the faucet
          flushing behind it. (to lessen the fumes even more dilute with sodium
          hydroxide solution)
        <P>
        <H3>Hydrogen Iodide(57%) <A href="references.html#7">[7]</A></H3>

<P>Hydrogen iodide can be prepared by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide gas on iodine. The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is generated by reaction of dilute HCl solution on iron sulfide (fools gold, pyrite) in a gas generator.</p>

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="pictures/picture5.gif">

<p> Hydrogen sulfide is what we commonly know as rotten egg gas and the smell of stove gas since it found in both. This is what will kill most people. Don't let its
familiarity disguise it's hazards. It is extremey poisonous and exposure to small quantities numbs ones perception of increasing concentrations; although, it will remain
unmistakably present. To generate the H2S dilute muriatic acid with an equal volume of water and fill the separatory funnel. Fill the reaction flask with powdered iron
sulfide. Run in the HCl solutioan at such a rate as to keep steady bubbling in the receiving flask. The H<sub>2</sub>S can be bubbled through a flask containing water to remove
HCl(not shown) before entering the receiving flask. The receiving flask should contain a constantly stirred (magnetic stirrer) suspension of 120g I<sub>2</sub> (iodine,
solid not tincture) and 150 ml water. The H2S that is not absorbed in the iodine suspension is bubbled through a lye solution(not shown) and then out through the fume
hood. The solution will become clear(from red) and sulfur will accumulate in the flask when the reaction is complete. The sulfur is filtered out and the solution boiled in a hood
to drive out dissolved H2S gas. The boiling is continued until no black precipitate(copper sulfide) forms when 1ml of the solution is added to a cupric nitrate solution (1g in 10ml
of water). The solution is then distilled being sure to add boiling chips. The fraction boiling from 125�C to 127�C is collected. This is the acetropic 57% solution,
bp 126�C(@760mmHg), density 1.70. Store the acid in a dark bottle and use soon after preparation to avoid considerable decomposition. The yield is 90% based on iodine consumed.</P>

<H3>Chlorine <A href="references.html#8">[8]</A></H3>

<P> Chlorine can be simply prepared using the same gas generator as used for HCl and H2S. Fill the separatory funnel with muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid from the
hardware store). Fill the reaction flask 1/4 full with calcium hypochlorite (swimming pool chlorine). Slowly add the acid solution to the flask and lead the gas formed
through the tubing to the solution receiving the gas. Be warned that chlorine gas is much more overpowering and destructive to mucous membranes than HCl and ammonia.
Excellent exhaust is a must. Chlorine gas can also be prepared by adding sulfuric acid to a mixture of table salt and manganese dioxide. The HCl that is formed from NaCl
and sulfuric acid is immediately oxidized to chlorine. Some info on the preparation of the other halogens, bromine and iodine, can be found in <I>Comprehensive Inorganic
Chemistry Vol III</I> such as isolation iodine from kelp ash.</p>

        <H3>Acetic Anhydride(from acteone and acetic acid) <A href="references.html#9">[9]</A>[108-24-7]</H3>
        <P> Acetic Anhydride is hot on the DEA's list due to its use in the manufacture
          of phenylacetone for methamphetamine production. It is conveniently
          produced from glacial acetic acid by bubbling ketene through it. Even
          diluted solutions of acetic acid could be used since the keten would
          react with water to produce acetic acid and water would react with acetic
          acid anhydride to produce acetic acid. In time, all of the water would
          be consumed and only acetic acid left to react with the ketene. All
          that is needed for formation of ketene is acetone and some glass blowing
          skills. See the reference cited for details. In place of chromel A,
          one could probably use nichrome wire(also a nickel-chromium alloy) from
          a toaster and the toaster's own plug to run it from.<BR>
          Acetic Anhydride is a combustible liquid with a flash point of 130�F,
          boiling point of 139�C, and density of 1.080.
        <P>
        <H3>Acetic Acid</H3>
        <P> Acetic acid is also referred to as glacial acetic acid in its pure
          form since it freezes in cool weather(16.7�C) and forms chunks(glaciers)
          that float in the unsoldified portion. It boils at 118�C and has a liquid
          density of 1.053. Acetic aid in solution is what we commonly know as
          vinegar. The vinegar purchased in the store is quite dilute, but could
          be concentrated. Refer to <I>Dicks's Encyclopiedia of Practical Reciepts
          and Processes</I> for simple methods of doing so. <I>Dick's Encyclopedia</I>
          has been reprinted as a part of <I>Granddad's Wonderful Book of Chemistry</I>
          by Kurt Saxon. The sodium acetate mentioned in some of the methods can
          be made by addition of sodium hydroxide solution to vinegar until the
          smell of vinegar is barely perceptible and then distilling off the water.
        <P>
        <H3>Ammonia</H3>
        <P> Ammonia gas is easily prepared with the gas generator apparatus used
          for HCl, etc. Add an equal volume of red devil lye or other quality
          lye(sodium hydroxide) to water. Stir until it is dissolved. A large
          amount of heat will be evolved in forming the solution. (At 50% concentration
          sodium carbonate will settle out and on exposure air, CO2 reacts with
          the sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate, so keep stoppered). Pour
          the solution into the separatory funnel in the apparatus. The reaction
          flask is filled with ammonium nitrate fertilizer which is about half
          ammonium nitrate and half ammonium chloride. The sodium hydroxide will
          release ammonia and form sodium chloride(table salt) and sodium nitrate.
          Lead the ammonia through the tubing and into the solution requiring
          the ammonia.

        <H4>Determining Concentration</H4>
        <P> <B><I>Scale weight</I></B><BR>
          Place a flask or beaker containing a known volume of liquid(alcohol,
          water, etc.) on a scale. Calculate the liquid's weight by multiplying
          it's volume by it's density.(density of water is 1, density of methanol
          is 0.79g/ml). Calculate the weight of ammonia needed to produce the desired
          concentration by multiplying the concentration needed(decimal form i.e.
          50%=.50) by the liquid's weight and dividing this by 1 minus the concentration(decimal
          form).
        <P> weight of liquid * concentration <BR>
          -------------------------------- = weight of ammonia needed<BR>
          1 - concentration
        <P> When the scale shows this increase in weight, you have the desired
          concentration. Since weight in the tens or hundreds og grams will be
          weighed, an inexpensive school balance can be used with 0.5-1g  accuracy.
        <P> <B><I>Density/volume</i></B>
        <P> Another way to determine concentration is to first determine the density
          of the solution. Sine beam scales that can't hold a whole beaker full
          of liquid can support a weight from the beam(with a thread). This weight
          can first be weighed in the air and then weighed while suspended in
          the solution. The difference in this weight divided by the volume of
          the weight is the density of the solution. The volume of the weight
          is easily found by submerging the weight in water in a graduated cylinder
          and measuring the volume change.<BR>
          Now all you need to know is the original volume of the solution and
          it's density and the final volume of the solution and its density you
          calculated. From this you know the weight of the original solution(volume
          * density) and the weight of the ammonia added(original weight - final
          weight) and you can calculate concentration(weight of ammonia divided
          by the total weight of the solution).
        <P> <B><I>Saturated solution</i></B>
        <P> Since nearly all of the ammonia will be absorbed by the solution before
          it is concentrated, one can easily tell when it has reached this point(when
          the smell of ammonia becomes quite strong). The concentration is then
          just a function the particular solvent's temperature. In general, the
          lower the temperature the more ammonia will dissolve. Following are
          the saturation concentrations of solvents at various temperatures.

<H3>Hydrogen</H3><P>

Although hydrogen is not used in any of the syntheses in this book it's simple preparation is
worth mentioning. In the spearatory funnel of the HCl gas generator, put a lye solution made
from equal volumes of red devil lye(sodium hydroxide) and water. Fill the reaction flask half
way with folded or rolled up pieces of aluminum foil. Feed in the lye solution at a rate to
meet desired production. Feeding the gas from the generator through a flask containing calcium
chloride will remove water vapor. Both the dissolution of the lye in water and the reaction
with aluminum generate a lot of heat so be careful handling your apparatus. (Try filling
plastic bags with hydrogen)<P>

<H3>Sulfur Trioxide</H3><P>

Sulfur trioxide when combined with water forms H2SO4, sulfuric acid. Although sulfuric acid can
be bought with relative ease, fuming sulfuric acid cannot. Fuming sulfuric is 100% sulfuric
acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it. It is also called oleum. This is not called for in
any particular synthesis in this book, but its application can be very useful for the
outgoing chemist. Adding carbon tetrachloride to it in the gas generator apparatus will
produce phosgene(a deadly war gas and highly reactive intermediate compound). Reacting it
with methyl alcohol gives dimethyl sulfate(a mehtylating agent)(<I>Guyot and Simon, Chemical
Abstracts, 539, 1920.</I>)
To produce sulfur trioxide, sodium bisulfate is first dried in a thin layer on a pan in an
oven set at 300�F. Let it dry for at least an hour. The sodium bisulfate is swimming pool pH
minus adjuster. The sodium bisulfate is then placed in a flask set for distillation. Heat this
under a gas flame. The bisulfate will melt and convert to sodium pyrosulfate and water. Try
to control the heat to where water is just being produced. Collect the water and discard. When
no more water is produced heat the flask more vigorously and the sodium pyrosulfate that
was previously formed will decompose into sulfur trioxide and sodium sulfate. Collect this gas
in a cooled flask. It will liquify and then solidify if the temperature is low enough. If
fuming sulfuric acid is the goal, collect the gas in chilled concentrated sulfuric acid. One
could collect the gas in water and form the sulfuric acid first but that would take more time
and sodium bisulfate.
Sulfur trioxide can be produced in a similar fashion by heating ferrous sulfate(copperas,
iron sulfate for gardens) or ferric sulfate to a read heat after first being dried in an
oven for several hours. This is the method employed for sulfuric acid manufacture before
the chamber process for burning sulfur was developed. Iron oxide, rust, is left afterward.
Heating it hot enough is the trick.<P>

<H3>White Phosphorus</H3><P>

White phosphorus is another starting point for many compounds such as phosphorus trichloride,
phosphorus tribromide, phosphoric acid, and phosphorus pentoxide. One must be careful in
handling phosphorus. Forceps and other instruments must be used in handling it since the heat
from ones body would ignite it in air. It will ignite in moist air at 30�C. It can be melted
under water at 44.1�C. 50-100mg is fatal when taken internally. External exposures can lead to
nechrosis of the bone which was an industrial disease known as phossy jaw when matches were
still manufactured from white phosphorus.
The red form of phosphorus is the one people are more familiar with since it can be handled
more easily. It only burns in air when heated to 260�C and it is relatively non-toxic as long
as it does not contain the white form as an impurity.
Phosphorus' preparation was kept secret by the first alchemists who discovered it. Luckily
for us, its preparation is now well known. Make a clay retort with a lid from modeling clay
and bake it in an oven or kiln. Fill the retort 1/3 of the way with a mixture of Triple
siper phosphate from the local nursery and 1/4 of the phosphate's weight of sand and 1/4 of
the phosphate's weight of charcoal. The mixture should be as finely powdered and well mixed
as possible. A high quality charcoal or activated charcoal from the fish section of a pet
store should be used for charcoal. Place the lid on the retort and seal with clay or cement.
With the neck of the retort dipping in a container of water, begin heating the retort. The
temperature must eventually rise to 1450�C. This can be accomplished by heating the retort
with coal or an acetylene torch. It can be preheated with a propane or natural gas flame, but
they are not hot enough themselves. Building a brick enclosure around the retort with an
opening for the neck and flame will help maintain the temperature. White phosphorus and carbon
monoxide will distill over into the water where the phosphorus will condense and the carbon
monoxide bubble out. The reaction can be summarized by the following equations.<P>

<H3>Acetamide
 <A href="references.html#10">[10]</A></H3><P>

Acetamide is used to later synthesize methylamine. Acetamide itself is easily prepared from
ethyl acetate and saturated ammonia solution. The ethyl acetate needed can be obtained by
distilling denatured alcohol(ethyl acetate is the major component) purchased at the hardware
store and collection the portion boiling around from 70-78�C. Wash this fraction with sodium
carbonate solution, then water, dry over calcium chloride and redistill collection the
portion boiling at 77�C. The best thing about this route to methylamine is that every
component is commonly available.
200 grams of ethyl acetate are placed in a flask followed by 300ml of 28% commercial ammonia
(or 195ml H2O). Cool this mixture in an ice salt bath to -8 to -10C. Bubble in dry ammonia gas
by running ammonia gas from the generator through a flask containing calcium chloride and then
into the mixture. When the solution is saturated(smell of ammonia is strong from undissolved
gas) stopper the flask tightly and let it sit in a cool place for 3 days. Within a day or
so the layers will merge into one. After 3 days, distill the contents of the flask under
reduced pressure on a boiling water bath. Distill the residue on an oil bath under reduced
pressure collecting the distillate in a cooled receiving flask. This is acetamide. Acetamide
melts at 81�C, bp 222�C, @100mmHg bp 158�C, @40mmHg bp 136�C.<P>

<H3>Mercury Chloride[7487-94-7]</H3><P>

Mercury chloride(HgCl2, mercuric chloride) is prepared from mercury by the action of aqua regia
or chlorine water. It is also prepared by first forming the sulfate with concentrated sulfuric
acid and then subliming it with manganese dioxide and table salt. (see <I>Thorpe's Dictionary
of Applied Chemistry</I>). Mercuric chloride is a white crystalline solid that melts at 227�C
and sublimes at 300�C. Adding a small amount of sodium hydroxide solution forms a yellow
precipitate of HgO. Mercurous  chloride, calomel, forms a black precipitate with soidum
hydroxide solution.
Aqua regia is prepared by mixing strong nitric acid (1 volume) and muriatic acid (4 volmues).
The nitric acid acts to dissolve some of the mercury where it is then acted upon by free
chlorine(Cl2). The chlorine is formed in aqua regia according to the folowing equation.<P>

<H3>Acetone</H3><P>

Acetone is soluble in water and in 70% strength it is sold as finger nail polish remover.
Alongside other solvents, acetone is sold in the pint, gallong and 5 gallon sizes in the
paint section of hardware stores. In this form, it is full strength. Water content in this
commercial form is low since it does not form an azeotrope with water, but drying overnight
with calcium chloride or potassium carbonate and distilling the solvent will remove much of
the water that is present. Addition of phosporus pentoxide to this dry acetone and distilling
will reduce the water content to approximately 0.01-0.02%. Acetone has a boiling point of 56.5�C
and a density of 0.788 g/ml<P>
