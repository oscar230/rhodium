<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This indanylamphetamine, (also called IAP, 1-(5-Indanyl)-2-aminopropane or 5-(2-aminopropyl)indane) 
        is an analog of MDA, but with both oxygens in the methylenedioxy bridge 
        replaced by methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) units. It has been shown to not 
        be a serotonergic neurotoxin, and is active at 0.2 mg/kg in Nichols' lab 
        rat tests, compared to 0.8 mg/kg for MBDB. However, the lab rat results 
        show that the effects should be somewhere inbetween MDA and MBDB, as it 
        doesn't fully substitute for the purely serotonergic compound MMA (3-Methoxy-4-Methyl- 
        Amphetamine), but does share some of the dopaminergic effects of MDA. 
        Further animal tests showed that IAP does not substitute for amphetamine, 
        so the compound is not a particular stimulant either. IAP is also one 
        of the most active serotonin-releasing agents known so far, together with 
        the 4-iodoamphetamine and <a href="http://www.ecstasy.org/info/4-MTA.html">4-methylthioamphetamine 
        (4-MTA)</a>. However, 4-iodoamphetamine is a serotonergic neurotoxin, 
        and 4-methylthioamphetamine has also shown signs of toxicity, as it also 
        exhibit MAOI properties. This together with is serotonin-releasing properties, 
        makes it prone to give a <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/sersynd.htm">serotonin 
        syndrome</a> in people taking it, and several <a href="http://ramindy.sghms.ac.uk/~ltg/4-mta.htm">4-MTA 
        related deaths</a> has been reported. The same cannot be ruled out for 
        IAP, so <i>caution is advised in any human testing of this compound</i>. 
        The animal test results suggest that the active dose is somewhere between 
        20-40mg. In October 1998, there were news reports that the compound had 
        been seized together with other ecstasy-like compounds in South Australia 
        (possibly Adelaide), confirming that it has been manufactured in clandestine 
        laboratories there.

        <h3>Chemistry</h3>

        <p>Indane is used as a starting material in this synthesis. It can either 
          be bought as is, or made from the ten times cheaper indene by any suitable 
          kind of hydrogenation. The indane is formylated here through Friedel-Crafts 
          alkylation with <a href="dcmme.html">dichloromethyl methyl ether</a> using 
          Tin(IV)Chloride as the Lewis acid. 
          The intermediate product from the alkylation 
          hydrolyzes to the aldehyde in water. To purify the aldehyde, it is stirred 
          with activated carbon (such as powdered Norite), and then filtered through 
          some silica gel and Celite. The crude aldehyde is pure enough for subsequent 
          reactions described here, but can be purified either by making its bisulfite 
          adduct, washing this, and then decompose it by the addition of concentrated 
          potassium carbonate solution, followed by extraction into dichloromethane 
          and evaporating. It can also be purified by distillation, <a href="iap.madmax.html">bp 
          100-101�C at ~0.2 mmHg</a>. The common Vilsmeier formylation gives a lot of tar when used on indane and gives a mixture of both 
          the 4- and 5-carboxaldehyde. Other formylation strategies for indane has been discussed in <a href="indane.formylation.html">Kinetic's Indane Formylation Doc</a>.</p>

        <p>Preparing the nitropropene is pretty straight-forward, just a reflux 
          with ammonium acetate and nitroethane, but the purification is more 
          of a hassle, since it is an oil at normal temperatures, it has to be 
          purified by flash chromatography. The best method seems to be to wash 
          the reaction mixture with water until all the inorganics and nitroethane 
          has been removed, dilute with methylene chloride and dry the solution 
          over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, evaporate the solvent and running the nitroalkene 
          through a short column packed with silica gel.</p>

<p>The final reduction of the nitropropene and the subsequent isolation of the final indanylamphetamine is pretty straightforward, and the final product
can be recrystallized from isopropanol/ether to improve the melting point. The overall yield of IAP from indane is 54% of theory, which is pretty good.</p>

<h3>Experimental<a href="iap.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p><strong>Indane-5-carboxaldehyde</strong></p>

        <p>10g (84.6 mmol) of indane was dissolved in 100ml dichloromethane and cooled 
          to 0�C on an ice bath. With vigorous stirring, 15ml (127 mmol) SnCl<sub>4</sub> 
          was added all at once via syringe, folllowed by the dropwise addition 
          of 9.72g (7.65ml, 84.6 mmol) <a href="dcmme.html">dichloromethyl methyl 
          ether</a> over a 10-minute period. After 30 minutes, the ice-bath was 
          removed and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 125ml ice-water. 
          The aqueous layer was discarded, and the organic phase washed with 3x100ml 
          water, 3M HCl (3x50ml) and 2x50ml brine. The organic solution was stirred 
          with activated carbon and filtered through a thin pad of silica gel 
          on Celite. After removal of the solvent, the residue consisted of 12.2g 
          (98%) of a yellow oil pure enough for the next step.</p>

<p><strong>5-indanyl-2-nitropropene</strong></p>


<p>Indane-5-carboxaldehyde (4.0g, 15.9 mmol) was heated at reflux with 30 ml of nitroethane and 1.22g (15.9 mmol) of ammonium acetate for 4h to yield 2.43g
(76%) of the nitropropene as a yellow oil which could be crystallized with difficulty from methanol after chromatography (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), mp 33-34�C.</p>

<p><strong>Indanylamphetamine</strong></p>

<p>2.9g (14.3 mmol) of 5-indanyl-2-nitropropene in 100ml dry THF was added slowly to a stirred suspension of 1.5g (35.6 mmol) LAH in 150ml dry THF and the
reaction was stirred for 5h at room temperature. Excess LAH was destroyed with the addition of 10ml H<sub>2</sub>O, the mixture filtered through celite, the filter cake
rinsed well with ether and the solvent evaporated on a water bath. The residue was taken up in 100ml ether, extracted with 5x50 ml 3M HCl. The extracts was
basified with 25% NaOH and extracted with 3x50ml DCM. The solution was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, filtered and the solvent evaporated. The residue was taken up in
20 ml ether and gassed with dry HCl gas. Yield after filtering and drying, 2.18g (72%), mp 218-219�C.</p>
