<h2>P2P by Hydroboration-Oxidation of Phenylpropyne</h2>
<p>Regioselectivity of Hydroboration of Unsymmetrically Substituted Alkynes with HBBr<sub>2</sub>-SMe<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>JOC 45, 389-395 (1980)</p>
</div>

<div class="stdtxt">
<p>The regioselectivity of hydroboration of 1-phenyl-1-propyne with HBBr<sub><small>2</small></sub>-SMe<sub><small>2</small></sub> (dibromoborane/dimethylsulfide) was determined by oxidizing the intermediate alkenylborane to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with basic hydrogen peroxide.</p>
 
<h3>By <sup><small>1</small></sup>H NMR Analysis:</h3>

<p>To a 25�C solution containing 0.62mL (0.575g, 4.95mmol) of CH<sub><small>2</small></sub>Cl<sub><small>2</small></sub> in 2.0mL of 1-phenyl-1-propyne and 0.26mL (0.329g, 3.87mmol) of CH<sub><small>2</small></sub>Cl<sub><small>2</small></sub> in 2.0mL of CDCl<sub><small>3</small></sub> was added 0.66mL (5.0mmol) of HBBR<sub><small>2</small></sub>-SMe<sub><small>2</small></su.   After being stirred at RT for 3 hours, the reaction was cooled to 0�C and quenched by adding 5.0mL of 3N . H.  After warming to RT and equilibrating, the mixture was oxidized by the dropwise addition of 2.5mL of 30% H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O<sub><small>2</small></. >.  The reaction was stirred at 25�C for 6 hours to ensure complete oxi. ion.  The aqueous layer was saturated with K<sub><small>2</small></sub>CO<sub><small>3</small></sub> and the organic layer sep. ted.  After being dried over anhydrous Na<sub><small>2</small></sub>SO<sub><small>4</small></sub>, the clear organic layer was analyzed by <sup><small>1</small></sup. NMR.  The benzylic protons of phenylacetone (3.67) were integrated against the methyl triplet of propiophenone vs. the CH<sub><small>2</small></sub>Cl<sub><small>2</small>. ub>.  After normalization of the number of protons contributing to each resonance, there was found 1.74mmol (35%) of phenylacetone and 3.01mmol (61%) of propiop. one.  Hence, 64% of the boron had been placed alpha to the phenyl group of 1-phenyl-1propyne with 36% beta to the phenyl.</p>

<h3>By GC Analysis:</h3>

<p>To a 25�C solution of 0.62mL of 1-phenyl-1-propyne (0.581g, 5.00mmol) and 0.80mL 
  of n-undecane (0.605g, 3.87mmol) in 2.0mL of CH<sub><small>2</small></sub>Cl<sub><small>2</small></sub> 
  was added 0.64mL (5.0mmol) of HBBr<sub><small>2</small></sub>SMe<sub><small>2</small></sub> 
  dissolved in 3.3mL of CH<sub><small>2</small></sub>Cl<sub><small>2</small></sub>. 
  After 3 hours at 25&deg;C, the reaction as cooled to 0&deg;C, quenched with 
  5mL of 3N NaOH, and oxidized by adding 2.5mL of 30% H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O<sub><small>2</small></sub>. 
  The aqueous layer was saturated with K<sub><small>2</small></sub>CO<sub><small>3</small></sub> 
  and the organic layer separated. Ethanol was added (2.0mL) followed by an excess 
  of NaBH<sub><small>4</small></sub>. After the mixture was stirred at 25�C for 
  5 hours, the excess NaBH<sub><small>4</small></sub> was quenched with dilute 
  HCl and the aqueous layer saturated with NaCl. [red]After this mixture was dried 
  over K<sub><small>2</small></sub>CO<sub><small>3</small></sub> and analyzed 
  by GC on a 10% carbowax 20M (on Chromosorb W; 6ftx1/4in.) column, there was 
  obtained 2.88mmol (58%) of 1-phenyl-1-propanol and 1.63mmol (33%) of 1-phenyl-2-propanol. 
  This corresponds to a regioselectivity identical with that obtained above by 
  <sup><small>1</small></sup>H NMR analysis. </p>
