<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The conversion of isomyristicin to a Schiff base of myristicinaldehyde is described. The subsequent hydrolysis 
of this base to the free aldehyde establishes a convenient preparation of this material. Apiolealdehyde is 
similarly generated from isoapiole, suggesting that this procedure may have general application in the 
conversion of the natural aromatic ethers of essential oils to the correspondingly substituted benzaldehydes.</p>
</div>

<p>In connection with a study of the syntheses of alkaloids related to <em>Anhalonium lewinii</em>, the need arose for 
appreciable quantities of myristicinaldehyde (<strong>4</strong>, R = H). Three preparatory routes were considered: the cyclic 
ether could be prepared from 5-hydroxyvanillin; 2,3-methylenedioxyanisole could be appropriately formylated; 
or modifications could be made on the chain of naturally available myristicin.</p>

<p>Examples of the first process which employ methylene bromide<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>1</sup></a> and methylene sulfate<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> in the formation of 
the methylenedioxy ring have been reported. In both instances the yields of myristicinaldehyde were 
prohibitively poor. Present attempts in this manner employing methylene iodide proved to be equally impractical.</p>

<p>The Vilsmeier reaction, which adds a formyl group to the aromatic ring, has been applied to 
2,3-methylenedioxyanisole. The earliest report<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>3</sup></a> described a 46% yield of product substituted adjacent to the 
methoxyl group, but subsequently it was observed that an appreciable percentage of substitution also occurred 
adjacent to the methylenedioxy group<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>4</sup></a>. A careful gas-liquid chromatographic analysis has been performed of 
the crude reaction mixture. The two isomers described are indeed the principal components, but a third peak of 
the desired orientation was consistently present. It amounted to only 5% of the total aldehyde content, 
however, and no experimental variation could be found to increase this yield.</p>

<p>The third route, that which starts with myristicin, appeared to be the only practical synthesis of the title 
compound. Base-catalyzed isomerization to isomyristicin (<strong>1</strong>) places the double bond in a position appropriate 
to an aldehydic end product. KMnO<sub>4</sub> has been employed in a number of procedures<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>5</sup></a> to provide the final 
aldehyde, but there is concurrent formation of the corresponding benzoic acid. Hydrogen peroxide with a 
vanadium catalyst<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> precludes acid formation but still provides only modest yields. It has only been through 
ozonolysis that sizable quantities of <strong>4</strong> have been prepared<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> but here minor variations in the reaction 
conditions seriously affect the yields realized<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>7c</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It has been observed in the course of the preparation of a number of &beta;-nitrophenylpropenes from the 
corresponding olefinic precursors<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>, that there was invariably produced a small amount of the aromatic 
aldehyde that would result from cleavage of the propenylbenzene at the double bond. This hydrolysis of the 
product nitropropene into its theoretical synthetic precursors (benzaldehyde and nitroalkane) was explored as 
a preparative route to these aldehydes which are otherwise difficult to obtain.</p>

</div>

<p>It has been found that this hydrolytic reaction is the principal reaction to occur when an amine that can form 
a Schiff base (<strong>3</strong>) is introduced. The completion of the synthetic cycle by the base-catalyzed condensation of 
the product aldehyde with nitroethane to regenerate the nitropropene (<strong>2</strong>) both verifies the structure of the 
aldehyde generated and confirms that the action of <a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/acetylene2tetranitromethane.pdf">tetranitromethane</a> is indeed on the &beta;-carbon of the 
phenylpropene. Of a number of bases explored as agents in this displacement, primary amines related to 
benzylamine gave the most consistent results, and of these DL-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine appeared to be the best.</p>

<p>The reaction is allowed to occur between stoichiometric amounts of the benzylamine and the nitropropene. If 
the amine is employed in excess as a solvent a material that corresponds to a 1:1 adduct of these two 
components is obtained as the principal product.</p>

<p>This procedure has been successfully employed in the preparation of apiolealdehyde (<strong>4</strong>, R=OCH<sub>3</sub>) from 
isoapiole (85%) and appears to be generally applicable to nitropropenes derivable from natural essential oils.</p>


<div class="exp">
<h3>Experimental</h3>
<p><strong>1-(3-Methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene (2)</strong></p>

<p>A solution of 50 g isomyristicin (<strong>1</strong>) in 300 ml dry acetone and 24 g pyridine was cooled to 0°C with 
vigorous stirring. There was then added 54 g of cold <a href="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/acetylene2tetranitromethane.pdf">tetranitromethane</a> which caused a slight temperature rise 
(to 5°C) despite the external cooling. The stirring was continued for 2 min at which time the reaction mixture 
was quenched with a chilled solution of 16.8 g KOH in 300 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. Stirring was continued while the heat of 
neutralization dissipated. and the product was then removed by filtration. An additional quantity of the 
nitropropene (for a total of 50.7 g, 82%) was obtained from the filtrates by extraction with methylene 
chloride. The low melting point (103°C) was due to a small contamination with myristicinaldehyde which is 
generated concurrently. Although it cannot interfere with the subsequent reaction below, it can be removed by 
recrystallization from methanol to yield yellow needles of <strong>2</strong>, mp 110°C.</p>

<p><strong>Myristicinaldehyde (4; R = H)</strong></p>

<p>An intimate mixture of 50g <strong>2</strong> and 26g DL-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine was heated on the steam bath until 
solution was effected and the evolution of nitroethane was complete. The intermediate Schiff base <strong>3</strong> was 
hydrolyzed without isolation by the addition of dilute hydrochloric acid and continued heating. At 60-80°C
there was an abrupt solidification of the myristicinaldehyde that had formed and further heating was 
unnecessary. The aldehyde is removed by filtration of the cooled reaction mixture and could be purified either 
by crystallization from water, or better by exhaustive extraction of this crude solid product with boiling 
hexane. The yield thus obtained is 36.9 g (97% of theory and 79% overall from isomyristicin) of a cream-colored solid with mp 128-129°C.</p>

<p>Complete integrity of the ether orientation was established by the reconversion of <strong>4</strong> to <strong>2</strong> with nitroethane 
as has been described for the trimethoxy counterpart<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of the Nitropropene:&alpha;-Methylbenzylamine Adduct, C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>·<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>

<p>When an excess of the benzylamine is employed as a solvent, the addition of water at the end of the 
above-mentioned dissolution resulted in an intensely insoluble product, mp 161°C (decomposition) which is soluble in 
neither the aqueous nor the organic phase. This white solid, on washing with acetonitrile, showed an analysis 
that indicated it to be an adduct of one molecule of each of the reactants, with about two molecules of water 
of hydration.</p>

<p>A more convincing argument for this molecular formula comes from mass spectrometric analysis, which showed 
a molecular ion at <em>m/e</em> 358 which corresponds to the water-free 1:1 adduct. A daughter ion at <em>m/e</em> 283, 
corresponding to the loss of the CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> moiety, is confirmed by an appropriate metastable peak. An 
independent daughter peak at <em>m/e</em> 237 indicated the loss of &alpha;-methylbenzylamine moiety but with the retention 
of the nitroethane; this corresponds to the production of an ion corresponding to <strong>2</strong>. The use of benzylamine 
led to a similar product (mp 152°C decomposition) and lends weight to the suggested stoichiometry<a href="myristicinaldehyde.shulgin.html#notes"><sup>*</sup></a>. Although 
the microanalytical results indicated some two or three molecules of water of hydration, again the mass 
spectrum showed only the molecular ion peak corresponding to the anhydrous 1:1 adduct (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>20</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; <em>m/e</em> 344). 
and both daughter ions corresponding to the loss either of nitroethane (<em>m/e</em> 269) or of benzylamine (<em>m/e</em> 237).</p>

<p><strong>Apiolealdehyde (4, R = OCH<sub>3</sub>)</strong></p>

<p>Employing the procedure described above for isomyristicin, isoapiole (mp 55–56°C obtained from apiole of 
Oil of Parsley) was nitrated to 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene, and this 
intermediate was similarly converted to the aldehyde. This product aldehyde (mp 102–103°C) was obtained in a 75% 
overall yield from isoapiole.</p>

<p><strong>Formylation of 2,3-Methylenedioxyanisole</strong></p>

<p>The crude reaction product, obtained from the interaction of 2,3-methylenedioxyanisole with the Vilsmeier 
complex generated from N-methylformanilide and POCl<sub>3</sub>, was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Complete 
separation of the three possible benzaldehydes was achieved through the use of an ethylene glycol succinate 
column (15%, 150×1 cm) at 190°C. The two major peaks emerged at 7.8 min and at 12.0 min, and were readily 
identified as 2-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde and 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde. 
respectively. The third aldehyde, myristicinaldehyde, occurred as a minor peak at 9.5 min. A characteristic 
ratio for these materials was 45:9:1, and variation in reaction condition caused marked variation in total 
yield but little change in this ratio.</p>
