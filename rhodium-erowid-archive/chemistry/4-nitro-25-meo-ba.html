<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>A selective preparation of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde is proposed in a procedure involving the transformation of the aldehyde group to a diacetoxymethyl group.</p>
</div>

<p>Quinone containing macrocycles have attracted considerable attention in recent years<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>1-5</sup></a> since they offer a
basis for the chromogenic or electrochemical detection of a variety of metal cations and model biomimetic
systems for metalloenzymes. On the other hand, naturally occuring macrocycles containing the quinonoid system
are potent antifungal<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> or antitumour<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>7</sup></a> antibiotics.</p>

<p>In the course of our studies on cyclic peptides containing the quinone moiety, it was necessary to prepare
2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>2</sup></a> on a multigram scale. Unfortunately, although 3- and 6-nitro derivatives
can be easily obtained in good yields from 5-methoxysalicylaldehyde<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>6</sup></a> and 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>8</sup></a> <strong>1</strong> respectively, the 4-nitro derivative is only a minor product of the nitration of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde.
Furthermore, its purification involves laborious fractional crystallizations from ethanol. Thus, we sought to
modify the orientation of the reaction by the use of different solvents and found that nitration of <strong>1</strong> in
acetic anhydride gave the 4-nitro derivative as the major product (91%) and the 6-nitro derivative as the minor
product (9%) with an overall yield of 89%. However, when the hydrolysis of the reaction mixture was
not complete, we isolated small amounts of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde diacetate <strong>5</strong>.</p>

<p>This result leads us to prepare 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde diacetate<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> <strong>4</strong> and nitrate it. As we expected, <strong>4</strong> afforded the 4-nitro derivative selectively in excellent yield (90%). This selectivity is thought to be due to
the bulky diacetoxymethyl group and/or to its electron-donating power (in spite of the reduction of the
electron-donating ability of the methyl group by introducing two acetoxy groups). Finally, <strong>2</strong> can be easily
obtained in a one-pot procedure without purification of the intermediate compounds.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>


<p>TLC analyses were performed on a 3x10 cm plastic sheet precoated with silica gel 60F254 (Merck), 0.2 mm
(Solvent system: ethyl acetate/ hexane 2:3).</p>

<h4>2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde diacetate</h4>

<p>This compound was prepared as previously described<a href="4-nitro-25-meo-ba.html#refs"><sup>9</sup></a> in 96% yield, mp 110�C.</p>

<h4>Nitration of 2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde diacetate</h4>

<p>20 mL of nitric acid (70%, 320 mmol) was added dropwise to a cooled solution of <strong>4</strong> (6.7g, 25 mmol) in acetic
anhydride (50 mL) at such a rate as to maintain the temperature between 10-15�C. After being stirred for 1
hour, water (250mL) was added and the solid was filtered off and dried to give a mixture of <strong>5</strong> (70%) and <strong>2 </strong>(30%). This mixture was stirred with 1N HCl (50mL) for 2 hours (the reaction was followed by TLC) and
extracted with ether (3x50mL). The ethereal layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to give <strong>2</strong> (4.75g). 5 mp
168-70�C.</p>

<h4>Nitration of 2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde</h4>

<p>The procedure was the same as for <strong>4</strong>. A complex mixture of 4-nitro- and 6-nitro-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde and
their respective  diacetates was obtained. The acidic hydrolysis gave <strong>2</strong> (91%) and <strong>3</strong> (9%) with an overall yield of
89%. 2,5-Dimethoxy-6-nitrobenzaldehyde diacetate; mp 171-2�C.</p>

<h4>One-pot  preparation of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde</h4>

<p>A solution of <strong>1</strong> (4.15g, 50 mmol) and CuSO<sub>4</sub>&middot;7 H<sub>2</sub>O (0.05g) in acetic anhydride (50 mL) was allowed at room
temperature for 24 hours. After being cooled (10-15�C) 20 mL of nitric acid (70%, 320 mmol) was added
dropwise. The solution was stirred for 1 hour and 1N HCl (250mL) was added. The mixture was stirred for 2
hours and extracted with ether (3x50mL). The ethereal layer was dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to give <strong>2</strong> (4.5g, 85% yield). The same reaction on 200 mmol of <strong>1</strong> gave an 80% yield.</p>
