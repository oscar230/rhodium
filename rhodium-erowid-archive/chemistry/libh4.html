<p>Stoichiometry of Reaction of Sodium Borohydride with Lithium Halide in Diethyl Ether Using Mechanical Stirring with Glass Beads. </p>

</div>

  <p>In a typical experiment, a three-necked, 2000 mL, round-bottom flask with 
    sidearm containing glass beads (6 mm diameter, 180g, ~1/4 volume of the solvent), 
    a mechanically operated Teflon paddle (9 cm length), and an inlet for nitrogen 
    was equipped with a reflux condenser leading to a bubbler outlet for the nitrogen 
    gas. In the predried flask was placed 19.65g (500 mmol) of NaBH<sub>4</sub> 
    and 45.6 g (525 mmol) of LiBr under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was again 
    flushed with nitrogen, and 500 mL of diethyl ether was introduced with a double-ended 
    needle. The reaction was carried out at 25�C with overhead stirring for 18 
    h and at 35�C for 0.5h. Insoluble sodium bromide is formed as a white solid 
    and precipitated out completely. The clear solution of LiBH<sub>4</sub> in 
    diethyl ether was transferred by a double-ended needle into a 500 mL volumetric 
    standard flask. Approximately 350 mL were collected. An additional 50 mL of 
    ether was added to the flask by a double-ended needle, and the flask was then 
    maintained at reflux conditions with stirring for 15 min. On cooling, a clear 
    solution was observed above the NaBr precipitate. This solution was also transferred 
    to the volumetric flask. The ether extraction of LiBH<sub>4</sub> from the 
    precipitate was repeated twice, and the solutions were collected in the standard 
    flask. The solution was made up to the mark, and the concentration of borohydride 
    was determined to be 0.849 M by hydrolysis of a clear aliquot using a glycerine/H<sub>2</sub>0/THF 
    mixture for the hydrolysis. The remaining slurry was filtered and the volume 
    of the filtrate made up to 50 mL. The concentration of borohydride in this 
    filtrate was found to be 0.53 M. Hence, the total recovery of LiBH<sub>4</sub> 
    corresponds to 451 mmol (0.849x500 + 50x0.53) out of 500 mmol, a yield of 
    90%. Unsolvated LiBH<sub>4</sub> can be obtained as described above.</p>
