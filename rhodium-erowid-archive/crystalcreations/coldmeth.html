  make meth without heat&quot;<br>
  The honey reaction will begin spontaneously when the chemical mix is right. 
  </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ultimate 
  is to be in the lab at night during a lightning storm.<br>
  Prepare your solution, step to the window, and let the light energy from a lightning 
  flash supply the natural energy needed.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To use a camera 
  flash-bulb would be considered crass and synthetic.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mix is 
  dry. It is hard to achieve because of variability in reagents, humidity, barometric 
  pressure, room temperature.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5 ml of Water 
  is injected into the dry mix.<br>
  Any external energy can cause it to fire off.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reaction 
  is done near an ice bucket in case the initial surge gets out of hand.<br>
  A very long hose is used, to compensate for the reactions ability to shoot up 
  the hose. </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the initial 
  exothermia subsides, the mix again is quite dry.<br>
  10 ml water is injected, and the reactions moves out again, as the reaction 
  slows,<br>
  10 ml of water are added until the addition of water has no effect.<br>
  The hose is then back washed with water, to wash any meth into the reaction 
  flask.</font></p>

  trade secrets again?</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is legendary 
  that lightening speed is how the gods make it.<br>
  That is the combination that is considered perfect. When a flash of light will 
  kick it in gear.<br>
  To combine your reactants so perfectly that the tiniest bit of added energy 
  will make it go, without blowing your ass up.<br>
  The reaction, is almost spontaneous. </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have your tape 
  already cut into strips after adding the dry ingredients. Please stress the 
  point to tape the shit out of the stopper, hose, and flask. I am talking about 
  at least half a roll of duct tape. that flask should look pregnant at the top. 
  The pressure goes ballistic and can blow HI everywhere, not to mention the H2 
  explosion.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last time 
  I saw the cook, Mikey, he was very burnt from this process, not burned out but, 
  I mean his long hair was fried up, like from the flame and shit that got away.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ratios, 
  depended upon the quality of reactants but somewhere in the range of 1.5 : 1 
  : 1 by weight of<br>
  Iodine : ephed : RP<br>
  You can see that the RP is at a dangerous level.!</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reaction 
  is done in 15 minutes.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two 5 gallon 
  water bottles were used once, One held the reaction mixture, the second bottle 
  had two hoses<br>
  one to the reaction bottle and<br>
  one leading up to the roof.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea was 
  if the reaction got too strong the second bottle might contain some of the product 
  instead of blowing it onto the roof.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I should mention 
  that the free end of the hose was fixed to the opening of a 1 gallon plastic 
  jug.<br>
  The bottom is cut off, filled with foam and kitty litter and foam to contain 
  and help disperse the gas.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gas was 
  something I was curious about, I managed to sneak a very faint wiff, and immediately 
  wished I had not.<br>
  The gas will ruin anything it gets close to.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rapidity 
  of the process was super.<br>

<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, I'm 
  going to be commenting on various cold method pictures I've found:<br>
  &#149; What people have said, and how thier own comments relate to each picture 
  (or seem to relate, thier not my setup, (remember, I don't have a setup, I'm 
  not a criminal <img src="wizink.jpg" width="15" height="15">) of course...)<br>
  &#149; What I think about the setup..</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and finally, 
  a link my own drawing of what a cold method setup might look like (another shitty 
  diagram)... with some shitty instructions... (maybe not that shitty, but theres 
  no hope for me, yet (no want either, I don't like competition), in competing 
  with a seasoned bee like Worlock...)</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ONWARD!!!</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Image #1</b></font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="c11_cold1.jpg" width="300" height="209"></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok folks, toast 
  here... this picture was taken from Rhodium's Clandestine Lab Photo Album (check 
  out his page, <A HREF="http://rhodium.lycaeum.org">http://rhodium.lycaeum.org</A>, 
  it's my personal favorite)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Look at all 
  those jars of what appears to be honey... sweet nectar of the gods... well, 
  fuck the honey, we're talking about the setup itself...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Look up in 
  left hand corner of this image, see it there, the mighty cold method setup. 
  Now it appears as though there are two hoses. One of the hoses connects the 
  two bottles (looks like a braided hose, just like in </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="pushpull.html">methhead's 
  Push/Pull</a>, methhead is the fucking man... anyway, so it's a braided hose. 
  It looks almost like next to this hose theres a little tube, a pressure release 
  tube I would imagine, but this statement contradicts the one I'm about to make, 
  so you figure it out...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  second hose is the red one (I dont see any other hose, do you?), it appears 
  to be just a normal hose. Ok, quoting Worlock (he's also the man, the FUCKING 
  man)</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&gt;Two 5 gallon 
  water bottles were used once, One held the reaction mixture, the second bottle 
  had two hoses<br>
  &gt;one to the reaction bottle and<br>
  &gt;one leading up to the roof.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">aha, so this 
  red hose must be the second hose, on the second bottle... it just leads out 
  to the ground or wherever instead of up to the roof, much less safe...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&gt;The idea 
  was if the reaction got too strong the second bottle might contain some of the 
  product instead of blowing it onto the roof.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Get it boys 
  and girls? Neither end of the braided hose would go into the reaction content 
  (nor very far at all into the bottle). This allows for both HI gas, and H2 to 
  go from bottle 1, to bottle 2, to the the end of the red hose (and out)... and 
  if the pressure builds up, it also allows for liquids and stuff (in bottle 1), 
  to go through the braided tube, and down into bottle #2, not out the red hose 
  with the gasses (see the red hose doesn't go far down into the bottle either, 
  none of them do)...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">it could be, 
  however, that the little tiny tube next to the braided does exist, for escaping 
  gas (a small tube could be attatched), and the braided hose DOES go into the 
  content, so that, and the red hose, are only for liquids... this is waaaay more 
  likely than my first theory little thing...</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">anyway... This 
  cold setup is much like Picture #1, except 1 difference...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There appears

  a tube to take care of the gasses...</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is also 
  a second bottle, but looks like theres only one hose! well, I would assume the

  liquid... interesting either way... next...</font></p>

  (<a href="http://www.mninter.net/~publish/METHLAB/index3.htm">www.mninter.net/~publish/METHLAB/index3.htm</a>) 
  to just plain FUCK UP! or so it seems... maybe not though, let's try to make 
  some sense of this oh-so-strange strange diagram.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ok... you have 
  your reaction flask, the erlenmyer, the triangular red one... with all the reaction 
  contents... then you have your round bottom flask, for the excess water and 
  what-not... but theres other stuff...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">first off, this picture 
  sucks, if some one thinks of a good way to connect two flasks (a round bottom 
  and an erlenmyer) at the middle, with a hose, let me know, until then, I will 
  say this image sucks...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears as though both 
  flasks are open at the top... however, if you use a 2 hole stopper in the erlenmyer 
  flask, and a 3 hole stopper (do they make these, anyone know, e-mail </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">toast</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  but if they dont make them, one could probably use a two neck flask with a 2 
  hole stopper and a 1 hole stopper) on the round bottom it could work.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first hose (the one 
  for the HI, up top) could go in one of the holes in the erlenmyer (flask #1) 
  into flask #2, the round bottom one... in flask #1, it only goes down a little 
  ways into the flask (like I thought for the braided hose in image #1), but in 
  flask #2 this hose goes way down into the water, so the gas (gasses actually, 
  as Worlock said, its HI and H2, not just HI) bubble through the water. This 
  has been suggested in many HI/R synths using a refluxing... one would take the 
  gasses in a tube off the top of the condenser, and pipe them far away into a 
  bucket of water, and NaOH to basify the stuff, because the gasses would make 
  it acidic... I'm not sure if that would be ok here, I don't know how that would 
  work here, because of the second hose</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the second hose would go 
  in the remaining hole on the first flask, down into the contents... and the 
  second hole on flask #2 (if they make 3 hole stoppers... someone tell me</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">) 
  ANYWAY! almost done here... the second tube, the one for the hydriodic acid, 
  would go here (I dont see the point of having the hydriodic automatically go 
  into the the water as would happen with the diagram, only incase it overflows)... 
  just above the contents in this one...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">well now, theres still 1 
  hole left over on flask #2? why you ask? HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING? those gasses 
  need to go somewhere, this would be the place for the tube... the tube to the 
  roof, or to a bucket of water, or where-ever... actually, someone could probably 
  take the gasses directly off the first one, and only use the second one for 
  excess liquid, like image 1 or image 2... damn anti-drug people, thier just 
  weird... </font></p>
