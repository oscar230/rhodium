<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many new bees 
  get overwelmed with all the jive and just simply want wings. There seems to 
  be no easy explainations to manys questions. But in taking into account what 
  most are saying, I justed wanted to theorize a failsafe EASY way. Just plain 
  bored tonight and can't sleep. Everyone please tell me if this is a pretty much 
  on track. All comments welcome.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The simplisity 
  and vividness of corran horns dream are a basis for this write up. I remember 
  reading the easy push-pull method and really liked the idea for no escaping 
  HI fumes and some pressure for quick times, yet hated most of that write up, 
  especially that wash technic that would have to mainly of yeilded trashy stuff 
  for sure.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 2 clear 
  beer bottles or clear wine bottles.<br>
  &#149; A 5 to 10 foot clear braided pvc hose (hardware store plumbing stuff) 
  that fits over the top of the bottles.<br>
  &#149; 2 hose clamps.<br>
  &#149; A hotplate or electric skillet.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 3/4 
  part RP<br>
  &#149; 1 part sudo<br>
  &#149; 1 1/4 part I2</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea is to have one 
  bottle up high and the other reaction vessel low so the pvc hose acts as a condenser. 
  Think in the terms of an upside down capital J.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Add 2 cc, ml, or gr of water 
  to each bottle for a 7 to 30 g reduction. That is because only using a small 
  amount of water keeps the HI concentration high for quick reaction times. The 
  reason the upper bottle has a little water is so if the main reaction goes dry, 
  the bottle can be tipped upside down to but some absorbed HI fluid back into 
  the reaction bottle. Since this is a reduction and a by product of water is 
  formed why would anyone delute the reducing effect by weakening the HI acid. 
  My best guess buts it in the one hour to two hour tops with this pressure and 
  HI concentrate. Plus the heat added to an already starting exotermic reaction 
  of RP and I2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have setup made and ready 
  and hanging before adding materials to reaction bottle and quickly sealing with 
  hose clamp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heat up and let it go but 
  don't bubble main reaction bottle over half full. Try to shake down off heat 
  if it does but don't lose reaction. Add top bottle when starting to dry up in 
  main reaction bottle quickly keep heat back on. Once bubbling brew starts to 
  look clearer let cool. One to two hours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My guess to anything that 
  would screw up this type of reaction is to much water, losing the heat of the 
  reaction or not having the eph or sudo washed (for type aquired) enough before 
  starting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Add water and then 6 good 
  coffee filter papers filter out RP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lye out into toulene or 
  coleman fuel. (If problems seemed to of killed the reaction, or lying out created 
  trashy stuff; water wash, seperate and filter solvent before gassing.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use concentrated sulfuric 
  acid drain cleaner and salt to generate gas. If the concentrated sulfuric acid 
  is strong enough the gas doesn't have to be scrubbed dry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Warning: This kind of proccess 
  is known to leave bad, hard to crash, hungover feelings when one tries to stop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: The more costly the 
  cold medicine or broncule opener, the more of the right isomer of the stuff 
  it has to control one's cold symtoms or breathing problems. That is the value 
  and what everyone has been telling me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the bubbling snow has 
  been filtered, the fucked up attitudes that get thrown at this board should 
  only be from that farce moral majority that want to control you into the institution 
  of life that they control. The world isn't made for free thinkers when the rich 
  fail to see a way to make a profit off it. So beware of what one does or feels 
  or beleives in if it's different than the moral farts that rule with prisons 
  and twisted ways of looking at the constitution. Beware because in my day over 
  half the ones that swore to be cool and hip only take and steal and play the 
  control game. The only info anyone here gives, is info that gets one hated. 
  Now one has to learn how to hide or be slick and smart enough to avoid attention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why would anyone post anything 
  good, it only makes one hot and the controllers more out to get them?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But each in their own way 
  can piss in the wind or control the life one chooses. Good luck to all that 
  love this chem stuff. Take wing and fly carefully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If one improves the simplisity 
  of this theory, share it when your finished with it, peace.</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To answer one 
  of my own old posts to run it to the top, just to help some wanting easy theories, 
  it just don't get any easier. To me it's only theories because thats all I'm 
  suppose to post, yet a birdie in the sky flew down and told me it's a fact if 
  one can change a few things, like use 1 1/8 part I2 to 1 part eph. Use a 1 inch 
  by 18 inch cleaned out flouresent(sp) tube above the reaction bottle. And boil 
  for 2 to 7 hours(whenever the color looks right).</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funny how little 
  birds seem to know the facts. Bird said it was killer diller yet only 33 to 
  50 percent yeild.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But I have 
  a theory that's states doing anything under pressure is way to dangerous for 
  most. This is where most should use every safety precaution they can think up. 
  Yet I'm a fool and don't see myself being that safe, if this stuff wasn't illegal 
  I would try to test this theory. <img src="wink(1).gif" width="15" height="15"></font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't be clueless, 
  read what others are saying and find a safe way. This is just to give some an 
  idea on how easy the birds think this chem stuff is.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fly on,<br>
  Fool</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ps. Sorry everyone 
  in throwing an old dead post back to the top, thought someone to lazy to search 
  back might get an idea of what is going on. </font> </p>

<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now this little 
  half though out post is so dangerous to any clueless new want-to-bee it should 
  of been flamed to death. If one tried to follow these theories without much 
  knowledge I'm very sure one would get hurt and f**ked up pretty bad. This ramble 
  doesn't contain anything very safe or detailed in it.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bee careful 
  knew bees on what you ask for. </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This half ass 
  post can get you hurt. </font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am sure an 
  old bee can figure what info it contains.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So bee able 
  to study what many have to say, or blow yourself up or screw up your lungs because 
  this bit of info can hurt you!</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it only 
  points out things to make things easier to a knowledgable bee. Not someone that 
  is clueless.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read, read, 
  read and see, see, see.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">aFool, playing 
  games.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ps. If you 
  don't know the true, then research up on it. We ain't dreaming of making meatloaf 
  here. There are many well though out synths by more proffession types around 
  here that have posted real good and clear stuff in the past few years. I suggest 
  one research and find it. Or get hurt or screwed up pretty good (or is it bad).</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK. </font></p>
