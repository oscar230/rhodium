  when adding NaOH to either ephedrine (or pseudo or PPA) extract or to cooked 
  product, I'd call that one the 'fishy' smell of freebase. Cat urine, on the 
  other hand, refers to one of two things: Phenylacetic acid [P2P] when exposed 
  to H2O or the finished product of the P2P cook. You stink for weeks after making 
  it, and that's after you burn your clothes and take however many showers you'd 
  like. It's called Prope-Dope around my neck of the woods and it is THE shit. 
  RP/I method is fine and good (and MUCH less detectable), but P2P is a cut above. 
  Safrole I know nothing about, so no comment there. See ya.</font></p>
