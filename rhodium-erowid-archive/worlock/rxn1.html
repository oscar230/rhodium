1 oz of ephedrine / 1000 ml of flask
<br> 
<p>The larger the flask the more important it is to heat it evenly, A new
large flask will break on a hot plate that is too small.
<br>In one week I broke a 12 liter and a 6 liter flask because I used heat
to get difficult reactants to fire up. Better would have been to increase
the iodine and RP.
<br>If you have a poor quality reactant it is best to increase the amount
of the poor reactant a little, and to increase the amount of the good reactant
a lot. It does not help to add a lot of a shitty reactant

<p><a NAME="stpr"></a><b><u><font size="+1">Stopper and hose</font></u></b>
<br>The stopper has a hole in it, to vent the gasses into the push/pull
tanks, or to the outside.
<p>For the push pull ,It is fitted with a 3 foot length of 1/2 inch, or
3/8 inch braided food grade plastic hose type tubing. Almost any type of
tubing may be used. It is  variable. but needs to be somewhat stiff
so it will not collapse
<p>If venting outside usually a 15 to 20 foot hose,   longer
is fine. can be thin walled since collapsing won't be a big factor
<p>The main thing is it should be clean, fairly new, and in good shape,
and fit the stopper .
<br>A dirty deteriorating hose will taint your reaction with  particles
of a deteriorated plastic hose, nasty.

<br>Filter flasks work very well for a reaction flask but are  sensitive
to heat and may crack.
<br>Larger flasks are sensitive to uneven heating and are more difficult
to heat evenly.
<br>A 12 Liter flask on a small hot plate will heat unevenly and crack.
whereas a 6 liter will do fine on the same hot plate

<br>The tubing extends from the reaction flask to the push/pull unit which
is a gas trap, and pressure stabilizer.
<br>The gas outlet may lead outside, or into the sewer.
<br>Large quantities of Iodine can be recovered from these.
<br> 
<p>Here are examples of basic push/pull designs.

<p>The hose leading to the push pull unit can  attach to the side
port or the top.
<br>If attached to the side, the main top opening can be used to add water
or reagents.
<br>Notice that the two hoses,  one  hose leading to the reaction
flask,  and the other leading to the drain are <b><u><font size="+1">very
near the top</font></u></b> of the push pull units, to prevent push pull
water  from being sucked into the hoses.
<p>Use only enough water, so that if  <b><u>all</u></b> the water
ends up being pulled into the first tank, it will not be sucked into the
reaction hose,
<br>Only fill each of the tanks 1/3 to 1/2 full of water
<br>or
<br>Fill the first flask 3/4 full and leave the second flask empty
<p><b><u>Sizes of push pull units</u></b>- This is only generalized  
information, gathered from 20 or so different p/p units used. No actual
experiments were performed, the units were built and used.
<br>Of the above designs the "direct connection"  is much more sensitive
to the pressure changes.  The siphon designed tanks generally will
not respond to the pull, and they require more pressure to move the fluids
on the push.  In addition the dual connections through the top with
the increased pressure leads to gas leaks.
<p>The direct connection is best.
<p>A pair of 5 gallon water jugs with a siphon tube never did bubble any
air into the second tank and seemed to slow the reaction down.
<br>The 1 gallon tea jugs are great for up to 4 ounces of E

<p>Remember the second time around for the RP it will contain Iodide unless
well cleaned and dried , and therefore the actual amount of the RP is much
less.
<br>Because of the Iodide weight . So add 2x the RP if it was pre-used
and not cleaned.
<br>If the RP was washed in acetone and water then dried it is almost good
as new add 10% more RP for used
<br>Some bad news 92% is the top yield of chili by weight, theoretically
possible
<br>It is common to obtain between 50%  to 75%  chili by weight
and rarely 85%
<br>The addition of aluminum to the reaction reduces the amount of 
RP needed,  5-6 soda can pop tops / oz of E
<br> 
<p><a href="toc.html"><img SRC="tocbut.jpg" BORDER="0" height="32" width="66"></a>
<br><a NAME="Water"></a><b><u><font size="+1">Water</font></u></b>
<br>The reaction may  go without any water added, this is true if
using iodine from tincture, or if the humidity is high the E and RP adsorb
enough water to fire the reaction.
<br>The common mistake is adding too much water, and not getting any 
reaction. Mix the reagents dry, if the reaction does not fire, then add
<br>1-3 ml   distilled water /ounce  of  E.
<br>The mixture should be very damp,  a thick  mud,  but
not wet.
<br>As it fires off , the first thing that happens is it liquefies, and
becomes wet, so you want to start out as a thick mud,  then let the
reaction thin itself out.
<br> 
<p>This is such a touchy part of the reaction, experience is the only way
to be sure
<br>If the reaction still does not fire, Use heat, do not add more water,
yet.
<br>If heat does not do it or the mixture is very dry still add another
1-3 ml of water/ oz of E/
<br>Then try heat again .
<br>Keep alternating until it is goo like melted taffy. this should fire
with heat. for sure.
<p>At that point re-evaluate your three main items ( E, I2, and RP) are
any of them the potential problem? If not
<br>The last resort is to reflux it for a few hours.
<p>The quality of the water is extremely important to the quality of the
chili, and to the yield.
<br>Always used distilled water, and for even better results run the distilled
water through a Britta water filter to remove metals, and other trash
<br><a href="toc.html"><img SRC="tocbut.jpg" BORDER="0" height="32" width="55"></a>
<p><a NAME="Hydrogen"></a><b><u><font size="+1">Hydrogen Peroxide</font></u></b>
<br>If using recycled phosphorus some suggest using  a capful of hydrogen
peroxide also.
<br>I suggest you avoid using peroxide at all, if possible. The  reason
is peroxide in an acid environment will digest many organic molecules.
<br>In addition peroxide will oxidize the RP,
<br>In the reaction the peroxide will  change HI into  I2.
<p>Any HI that is not mixed in with E and RP is useless in the reaction
and is  escaping  This includes all the HI that is above the
reagents. The HI is only of value while it is being recycled within the
reagents.
<br>The bad aspect of heat, is that it tends to vaporize the HI . HI has
a boiling point of 117 C but this is a 58% solution with water.
<br>The concentrations of HI you are using is many times above that. 4
to 6.5 molar
<br>By adding peroxide some of this HI may be washed down into the flask
as I2.
<br>Peroxide will also strip off  organic molecules that may be stuck
on the RP like wax, this refreshes the  RP at the same time providing
I2,
<br>and may be enough to kick in a dying reaction.
<br>Additional heat is my preference. But try it and judge for yourself.
<br> 
<p><b><u><font size="+1">Cautionary Notes</font></u></b>
<br>Be prepared, the RP hitting the I2 will often start the reaction.
<br>It may be  impossible to see inside the flask, either from vapors
or the rise of reactants. Either way, if the surface of the reactants contents
can not be seen, act fast, because seconds count, shake it  hard.,
or swirl the contents Keep swirling  until you can determine what
is going on. Look  for a nice easy bubbling. If you fail to shake
it down you will end up with very little,  because the thick smoke 
indicates a fire is going on in the flask, this will destroy the E, 
or the contents of the flask may have expanded and are going to soon blow
down the hose, Hard shaking will stop both of these situations allowing
you to regain control,  If you hesitate all will be lost
<br>If the mixture starts to rise up, too high, swirl  it lightly
<br>Shaking before it blows out of the flask will save your whole reaction

it  will turn a potential  disaster, into a laughable "won't
do that shit, again" story
<p><b><u>Phosphorous fire confined to a flask</u></b>
<br><u>Too  hot of a reaction</u>
<li>
Place your wet towel over it ,</li>

<li>
You want to avoid the contents, that may be tossed out of the top of flask</li>

<p><br><b><u>Phosphorous fire not confined to a flask</u></b>
<li>
Phosphorus is hell to extinguish once it catches fire. <b>Do Not Touch,

will stick to whatever it contacts and burn</li>

<li>
The amount of smoke is unfathomable, and  will draw attention..</li>

<li>
Toss your wet towel over it, this will cut off  its oxygen, and buy
you time, maybe a minute. (don't worry, you will be moving at the speed

<li>
Wet dirt is the best retardant, water may just blow it around if a lot
of RP is  on fire.</li>

<li>
But water will put it out if you flood it</li>

<li>
The worst thing to do is to run away, leaving it out of control, probably
will result in a fire , injuries, and your arrest.</li>

<li>
Most Fire extinguishers are not very effective against a  phosphorous
fire</li>

<br>SWIM was drying RP in the oven,  unattended , when the glass bowl
broke, fortunately the RP was damp
<br>The first sign was an odd smell and difficulty breathing
<br>Then the smoke was obvious
<br>Two fire extinguishers were emptied onto the 4 oz of RP and  had
no effect ,. the wet towel slowed the fire and the garden hose finally
controlled it, by  flooding  everything.
<br>SWIM took a break.
<br>While cleaning up the mess SWIM noticed there was still RP on fire
and flooded it again it, and there were still spots on fire after that.

be able to make a determination.
<p><a NAME="The mythical  chili of the ancient"></a><b><u><font size="+1">The

<li>
 Weigh out the Ephedrine and I2, in a ratio of 1.0(E) <b>:  </b>1.1(I2)
, place in reaction flask.</li>

<li>
Mix the E and Iodine together.  Keep them dry,  They may liquefy
don't worry about it at all.</li>

<li>
Place the flask of E and I2 in the freezer for a few minutes while you
weigh out your phos (5 minutes or less).  The chems are slightly chilled
so you will  have time to mix the RP in well</li>

<ul> 
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Variations are as numerous as the number of
cooks, no two cooks use exactly the same methods and some cooks never do
the same thing twice. However certain details are always the same no matter
who does it.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Some mix red and I2 first , some mix e and
red, some add water at the beginning others add it later.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">some mix the reactants for hours, some barely
mix them at all before beginning the reaction</font></b>
<p>Heating the reactants before mixing is very dangerous and is 10 x as
dangerous if you are using free base E.  It will blow. The free base
has to be handled carefully and not forced to react in any way.
<li>
If doing over 1/2 oz and if not familiar with the free base, react the
HCl salt instead.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Prepare a pan of  hot water to heat up the flask, or use an electric
stove, SWIM uses an electric WOK filled with sand with a temperature controller</li>

<ul>
<li>
Some use a warming tray, hot plate, or the stove, some heat is usually
needed to get the reaction to go to completion..</li>

<li>
Avoid using an excessively high temperatures.</li>

<br><font color="#FF0000">Variations -my latest heart throb is the use
of sand placed inside of a wok or pan on the stove the reaction flask is
placed in a depression in the hot sand and partially covered up. The value
is the glassware does not contact the excessive heat of the stove top.
Even heating, .A milder heating the sand takes a while to warm up so the
reaction temperature  slowly rises , This works great when evaporating
solvents because the tendency toward over heating is reduced. The sand
I use is the standard 60 or 30 pound washed silica sand from the hardware
store it cost a couple of dollars for a 100 pound bag, the bag may 
not be easy for some to to carry, or even to pick up, so get some help
if your not  muscular . This is the same sand used in the sand filter
the 60 pound is probably better it is smaller grained.</font></ul>

<li>
Tear  6-10 strips of  sheet metal  tape 6"  long -
1 inch wide and have them ready to seal the stopper onto the flask</li>

<li>
Prepare a small cup of water, this will be added to the flask with an eye
dropper or a syringe</li>

<li>
Remove the E and I2  from freezer and add  the Red Phosphorous
(chili powder).</li>

<li>
Mix it  very well, it may  begin to react with just dry reactants.
You will smell and feel the HI as it hits your nose</li>

<li>
If the reaction is not happening or is slow and the flask has warmed to
room temp, you want to coax the thing to gently begin</li>

<ul>
<li>
If the reactants are  dry  Add 2 ml of water /oz of  E, 
shake it around,</li>

<li>
Often the reactants will lump up into large balls of chems, watch these
balls as they will  melt when the reaction is about to begin.</li>

<li>
if  it is still dry  add 1-3  ml more  of water / oz
E</li>

<li>
If no reaction place it on the heat 150 F</li>
</ul>

<li>
If using homemade  iodine from tincture you won't need to add any
water, usually  just mix and heat</li>

<li>
Increase the  heat slowly until it reacts</li>

<li>
<b><i><font color="#3333FF">SWIM will toss in 3-4 pop tops from soft drink
cans for the aluminum, it helps even out the reaction</font></i></b></li>

<li>
Once  it has begun carefully but quickly put on the vented stopper
and strap it to the flask tightly with tape.</li>

<li>
Be very gentle with the reaction flask, It is a tense moment as the reaction
is kicking in and your still tapping it up , plus you need to be watching
for excessive smoking of an over reaction and possible RP fire in the flask.
Just take your time and don't break anything, a few fumes won't hurt you,
but a lot of them will.</li>

<li>
<font color="#CC0000">If you cannot seal  the stopper in place and
the reaction has begun and fumes are getting out of control  , pour
water in it,  to stop the reaction and get away from the fumes,

In the Soviet Union and in much of Europe this is the final product, it
is called Meth/acid.  It is sold as a liquid , for injection, ingestion,
or snorting.  Now although the iodine is gone, it has been converted
to iodide as a salt and some is still HI. They notice that after taking
speed this way their joints are sore, muscle aches, skin eruptions, and
a severely hungover feeling after coming down, They are lucky to be alive.
The next step of basifying the mixture removes all those nasty iodides
and most of the water soluble contaminants, and in Europe people will add
bicarbonate to reduce the acidity of the mixture. Needless to say, they
were sent the full instruction on how to clean up the meth/acid.
<p>After normal filtering, Take a strong flashlight and shine it through
the mixture, look for  reddish particles  indicating phosphorous
is still present.   If it is there- Put a plug of a paper towel
in the funnel a few coffee filters and filter one more time, your flashlight
test will show no more phosphorous.

<br><b><u><font size="+2">Procedure Continued</font></u></b>
<li>
Create the chili  free base (oil soluble) by raising  the pH
of the water soluble layer to  pH 12.5-13,</li>

<ul>
<li>
 Slowly add  a cold (put ice in it) 20%  Sodium Hydroxide
solution( 200 gm of NaOH dissolved in 1000 ml of d-water).</li>

<li>
Add the NaOH slowly,  Swirl the flask or shake lightly, Hard Shaking
will create an emulsion and it will have to sit for hours before ot clears</li>

<li>
<b><u>Important-  </u></b>All pH measurements are made only on the
water layer (lower layer) or polar solvent.  To take a pH reading
on the non-polar,  upper oil. solvent is useless.</li>

<h3>
<b><i><u><font color="#000000">Solubility, ions,  polar, non-polar</font></u></i></b></h3>
<font color="#000099">Variation- as to when to add the nonpolar solution
is a common point of contention, you want a nice debate, this will get
you into the middle of  a fanatical argument.  Generally it is
a good idea to add the non-polar before adding the base, the non-polar
attracts the free amine (free base) E and M and helps them move more rapidly
out of the polar solution..</font>
<br><font color="#000099">However there are times when you do not want
a non-polar compound mixed in, Steam distilling , contamination, or to
observe the E and M changing solubility.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">The non-polar is not absolutely needed most of
the time , it depends on concentration, it may give a better yield, and
does move the E and M much faster.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">But unless you have a specific reason to not
do so, most newbees would be advised to add some non-polar prior to adding
the strong base. Experiment when you have a few cooks behind you.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">CAUTION adding NaOH too fast, to a hot solution
is dangerous. Many bees premix a 20% NaOH solution and then add ice cubes
to that, others add it straight .</font>
<br><font color="#000099">The idea is to get the pH up above pH 12.5.</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Contrary to some literature in Erowid's site,
only the amines and very similar compounds have this unusual ability to
freely change solubility from water to oil base when the pH is changed,
the fact that this is an uncommon property is the reason the A/B has been
so effective in thwarting DEA attempts to prevent the use of ephedrine.</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Morphine, codeine , heroine, and cocaine are common
examples they have CH-CH skeletal structures with the N-H and OH groups
exposed.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">The CH hydrocarbon chains and rings (aliphatic
and aromatic) are what is a non-polar polar molecule, like methane CH4,
or benzene C6H6</font>
<br><font color="#000099">The -OH adds a degree of ionic polar like quality
as in methanol CH3-OH, or phenol C6H5-OH.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">But it is the mainly the nitrogen =NH changing
to =NH2+ in the presence of excess H+(acid) that gives the legendary Hydrogen
bonding and full water(polar)(ionic)  solubility, along with attracting
anions like -Cl.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">Hydrogen bonding is an ass kicking ionic bond
that is 1/5 as attractive as a full bore covalent bond.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">Now that is some stickiness. You will find hydrogen
bonding when   N, O or Fluorine are present.</font>
<br><font color="#000099">Generally these three atoms determine if a hydrocarbon
will be water soluble.</font>
<p><font color="#000099">Free ions are water soluble in acidic or basic
solutions, it is only when the net charge is negated that they precipitate

<h2>
<b><u>Procedure continued</u></b></h2>
</ul>

<li>
Depending upon concentrations , The chili floats to the top, or will be
seen still in the water as a thick white cloudiness</li>

<li>
Check the pH when above 12.5 Add a non polar solvent (Coleman, Charcoal
lighter fluid, toluene, xylene, naphtha, ether, hexane ..etc.)  at
least 100 ml then 50 ml for every ounce. Shake Lightly. this should clear
out much of the cloudiness from the lower layer as the chili moves up into
the non-polar</li>

<li>
Adding rock salt (as much as will dissolve) causes the water to drop all
remaining chili, releasing it to the oil and increases your yield.</li>

<li>
Swirl at this point , or shake easily .</li>

<li>
Allow the mixture to layer, 10-30 minutes or more,  then separate,
discarding (but saving)the lower water/lye layer.</li>

<li>
Depending on concentrations there may be a whitish waxy looking substance
at the lower layer of the nonpolar,  looks sorta like emulsion, This
is often not  speed . This is  emulsion which rarely has anything
of value in it. If in doubt as to where exactly to make the cut off between
emulsion and non polar flush the lye /water layer and leave the emulsion
with the non polar. After the initial water wash is drained swirl the separatory
funnel very strongly , a snow storm of whitish globules will descend to
the bottom.  dump these they are emulsion, swirl repeatedly to remove
this nasty gakk it is dependent upon pH and concentrations and 95% of the
time is gakk at is best.</li>

<li>
Wash with water again and repeat the swirl to get after this emulsion,
it is an impersonator of meth but is tainted because it is an altered molecule
containing properties that place it in between polar and nonpolar, and
is best removed because it tends to pull anions and cations with it and
these will really taint your shit. This gakk will have properties similar
to chili but not identical.</li>

<li>
Wash the free base and fuel solvent with  d-water 3 times and separate
each time ( using 1/2 the volume of water  as the  the oil ).
Shake it well  when doing the wash, but  do not over shake. Add
this wash water to your discard bucket along with the lye water</li>

<h4>
After three washes- make the salt of meth</h4>

<li>
Add d-water again ( a smaller volume than the fuel), it is easier to evaporate
the less water you use</li>

<br>Add HCl drop wise,  shaking lightly, test the pH add more HCl 
until the water layer tests between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 .  This is about
6 drops of  30% HCl (muriatic) per gram of expected product,
<br>this makes the chili a  water soluble molecule again, and moves
it down into the  water layer.
<br> 
<p>Considering the shitty quality of muriatic acid, it would be great to
distill your own.
<br>If you are consistently getting dope that smokes burns dark and gakky
, consider the source of your HCl probably also contains sulfuric acid,
and you might consider gassing it  instead or distill your HCl first.
<br>Or simply do a recrystallization, which will give you "da kine", smooth
and sweet.
<br> 
<br> 
<li>
Separate the water from the non-polar again ,saving the water layer in
your boiling bowl</li>

<li>
Evaporate the water away, using  heat, and a hair dryer. The hair
dryer will improve yield , it  actually  cools  the solution
by evaporation.</li>

<li>
But the hair dryer will add debris from the air, so don't use hair dryer
on severely  dusty, smoky, or smoggy days.</li>

<br>If the pH goes below pH 6.0, go ahead and evaporate the water away
then   wash the crushed crystals  with acetone, to remove
the acid.

Crush up, the  chili in a bowl with minimum of dry cold acetone (
no water)</li>

<li>
Pour crystals and acetone into a filter</li>

<li>
Wash crystals by  flushing with more dry acetone, until they are white,

<li>
Optionally  wash them  with any of  the  non-polar
solvents to remove <b><u>non-polar soluble junk</u></b></li>

<li>
Wash off the non-polar solvent with acetone.</li>

<li>
<b><i><font color="#CC0000">Change to a clean collecting flask</font></i></b></li>

<li>
Keeping crystals in the same filter.  Add denatured alcohol to dissolve 
the chili and leave most salts and <b><u>insoluble</u></b> crap behind.</li>

<li>
It may take 10 minutes for all the chili to fully dissolve</li>

<h4>
For a quick clean evaporate the alcohol away</h4>

<h4>
For a major purification use recrystallization</h4>

<li>
Boil the filtered alcohol/chili  mixture until a slight skin begins
to form on the alcohol, add about 10 ml of fresh alcohol to dissolve the
skin again and add 20 ml of acetone, cover the container and place in freezer
for 6 hours or more up to 24 hours, the longer the better and bigger will
be the crystals.</li>

<li>
After the 6 hours,  Filter the crystals  cold and  quickly,
rinse lightly with a very small amount of ice cold alcohol, after the residual
alcohol evaporates from the surface of the crystals this will give you
some of the finest chili you have ever had.</li>

<li>
After washing with the alcohol as noted above , it is fun to place the
crystals on a dark surface , spread them out to help the residual alcohol
escape. Pull out the digital camera, and snap  a few pictures of your
beauties. These photos will be a source of enjoyment. Simply because it
is rare to see so much stuff, looking so good. Soon  it will be bagged
and such and looses that magic quality of the untouched pure crystal. You
will be one person in 1/2 of a million in the US that ever gets to see
this.</li>

<br><a NAME="recrystalization"></a><b><u><font size="+1">Recrystallization</font></u></b>
<p>This is the same as presented above in <b><u><font size="+1">De-contamination

<br>Re-crystallization of chili using methanol,  denatured alcohol,
or  91% isopropyl alc. will grow some very pretty, large crystals
and will make your product more pure and much more potent. This is one
procedure that is simplicity itself and always produces a major improvement 
with surprisingly little loss of product.
<br><img SRC="recryst.jpg" HSPACE="5" height="320" width="506" align="LEFT">Super
pure crystals, using denatured alc. and  vision ware
<p>After the chili was pulled out of the toluene (non-polar solution) using 
HCl and water,  It was run through a filter and placed in a vision
ware bowl for evaporation. The water was evaporated  leaving the crude
raw Crystals.
<br>These were crushed and washed with ice cold dry acetone.
<br>The washed Crystals were then dissolved in hot denatured alc. the alcohol
was boiled away until the first sign of skin forming or the first sign
of crystallization noted. Remove from the heat add enough alcohol to remove
the skinning so no more crystallization can be seen then add 20 ml of acetone,
if it turns cloudy add alcohol drop wise until it is clear again 
cover and place in freezer 6 hours or more( overnight is great) you will
return to find crystals floating in the liquor.
<br>Rapidly filter out the cold crystals , then wash them with a little
cold alcohol to remove any gakk on the surface and in the outer crystal
layer, set out to dry..
<br>All three steps were performed without ever removing the chili from
the vision ware bowl.
<br><a href="toc.html"><img SRC="tocbut.jpg" BORDER="0" height="32" width="55"></a>
<br><b><u><font size="+1">Recrystallization details</font></u></b>
<br>The Chili is dissolved in a minimum  amount of dry alcohol, 
this is  heated,  <b><u><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">USING
a Safety fan (Always)</font></font></u></b>
<br>as needed  to get it to dissolve , bring it to a soft boil . Continue
boiling until you begin to  see the chili form crystals on the surface
of the alcohol.  Known as the <b><i><u>Lynrd sign</u></i>.</b>,
<br><i>(The Lynrd sign??  Skynrd??  The chili forms a surface
skin &lt;yuk-yuk>  it was a joke get it ??  Lynrd Skynrd!!!)</i>
<br> This is a <b><i><u>super saturated solution</u></i></b> . Add
a little alcohol to dissolve the skin again, and add 20 ml of acetone
<br>Then  cover and set in freezer, as the temperature drops, 
crystals will form .
<br>Leave in freezer for 6 to 12 hours or even longer. Generally the longer
in the freezer  the bigger and better will be the crystals.
<br>The chili re-crystallizes as the temperature drops, the alcohol won't
freeze.
<br>As time goes on the crystals  "digest".   <b><i><u>Digestion</u></i></b> 
means the crystals are slowly re-modeled,  the outer layers with impurities
are stripped away a reform without the impurities. In addition the smaller
crystals dissolve and  become incorporated into the larger crystals
because of volume(cubic) versus surface area(square) considerations
<br>After which the resulting crystals were quickly cold   filtered
, washed with a little cold alcohol  and dried.
<br>The crystals should be rinsed lightly with alcohol  wash off any
of the mother liquor that is stuck to the crystals, and to remove the outer
layer of crystal which is slightly impure
<p>note for even better results:
<br>The super saturated solution(dissolved in hot solvent) forms crystals
faster than the hot but more dilute solution , but the more dilute allows
better digestion and more pure crystals.
<br>Life is such a trade off in every way.
<p><b><u>Appearance:</u></b>
<br>The resulting crystals were sparkly, 1 cm x 2 mm x 0.5 mm  
very clear
<br>up to 1 inch long and chunky
<p><b>BioAssay:</b>
<br>Performed repeatedly, and it was determined that the resulting product
was far superior to the original stock. The taste was greatly improved
. Any  nasty residue was essentially nonexistent. The overall potency
was increased significantly. Enough to warrant the use of this technique
in future productions.

<h3>
<b><u>Final thoughts</u></b></h3>
I could  say more but this is enough for  most to get fair shot
at it.
<br>I realize I repeat myself over and over many times,  for you to
retain the information in long term memory it must be repeated three times.
<br>85% of what you read will be forgotten within a few hours
<br>I have researched how people best retain information,
<p>Ideal for long term memory storage is to cover the information three
times, skipping one day between readings, Learned this way you will never
forget.
<p>If at first you don't succeed , before you try it again, analyze what
went wrong first!!!!  Other wise you will repeat the same error and
will have learned nothing
<br>At first you may  have failures, I did,   mostly due
to equipment or  chemicals
<br>Remember at this point you may still be a little green, but you have
taken the the plunge and you know much more than you suspect you know.
The amount you have learned at the hive is enormous , so don't kid yourself
into thinking your not getting it, more likely than not your are so close,
and just one little thing is stopping you.
<p>I estimate that at least 30% of you are tossing out good speed because
they are not sure about something.
<br>Take advantage of a failure to learn maximally from it, A failure is 
an  important tool, use it!!
<p>To figure out what went wrong,  Backtrack to the point that you
first noticed something was not right, there is more than enough descriptions
of what to look for and when you did not see what you expected to see,
The error occurred immediately before that.
<p>Believe in your own skills is what I am saying, because there is no
way you could have gotten this far without developing major amounts of
savvy about this stuff.
<p>One main cause of initial failure  is your Chemicals, everything
at first is OTC because you have not yet developed the connections for
supplies., and the OTC stuff has to be re-made to suit your needs.
<br>The ephedrine must be clean and the govt. is constantly tweaking the 
stuff. They screw me over at least two times a year with their concoctions.
<br>The Iodine the main source of energy for the reaction is touchy , if
made from tincture , wash it repeatedly by shaking it hard in a 2 liter
container (and not in a 4 ounce jar or by running water over it in a filter)
I will wash it with major amounts of tap water for maybe 4-5 times , then
finish it off with distilled water,
<br>Use an excess of iodine 1.5x to 2.0 x ratio if unsure.
<p>RP is only a problem if match-book stuff is used, you need a shit load
if from match strikers because the contaminants , glass specifically alters
your weighing. I have never used the matchbook RP but I have listened to
those that have, and it will work, from the amount of glass and trash that
is likely to have remained in the RP it is a good idea to use an equal
weight of MB RP and Ephedrine
<p>The Equipment will be OK if you follow the sizes used here, once you
go to nano-sizes or  to larger sizes  you will begin to have
problems, all the equipment needs resizing together, you can not just get
a bigger reaction flask to make bigger batches, every step of the way you
will be dogged by size problems, if you do.
<br>.
<br>To prepare everything properly is a pain in the ass , if doing it all
OTC for the first time it may take you several days to clean up the E and
Iodine and RP., but it is the formula for success,  if it were easy
anyone could do it, but everyone can't do this,  it takes a special
touch,  you either have it,  or you must learn it.
<p>Once you make a batch you become a major asset and people want what
you can create , stuff begins to come to you as if by magic, I am amazed
at what people will trade for a gram of this shit. They begin to bring
you  better chemicals, or you pay them in speed to acquire chems for
you. and "Viola" your home free. then  it is as easy as measuring
it out and mixing it together.
<p>As time goes on you become intimately familiar with the properties of
these Chemicals, and it will seem too easy, you will know what to do instinctively,
<p>You have seen it all now, at least once, so the best thing to do is
to get some  experience behind you, and start cooking away, be a good
observer..
<br>Once you have a successful  reaction,  90%  of the screw
ups are fixable easily, it is getting the stuff to react that should be
your primary focus. Once made you will get it out of the solution, 
believe me you will find a way.
<p>Save everything until absolutely sure that you have product or until
you know what went wrong.
<br>I still save everything until I have all the final product accounted
for.
<br>And even the nasty lye water contain recyclable Iodine
