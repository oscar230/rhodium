<br>Lets say you plan to do 15 grams of E (dry E) so you put it in a in
a 1 liter flask ,
<p>you decide you want a extremely fast reaction,
<p>Add 1.5 x I2 or 22.5 grams of I2 (dry I2). That is an excess and will
insure plenty of I2.
<p>Add 0.8 x Rp&nbsp; or 12 grams (dry RP) This excess amount of RP will
insure that PI3 and I- are available very rapidly to the reaction as it
is needed.
<br>Mix it together and it sits there.
<br>Tape on a stopper with an attached fume hose and inject 4 mls of water
into the hose so it drips into the reaction flask , shake it up and 'viola'
a spontaneous reaction , no heat is added , the reaxtion is very strong
bubbling seething producing gas.
<p>Shake it and chill it obtaining a general control and slowing the reaction,
<br>A little heat is added and the reaction fires off hard turning darker
and turbulant, within 30 seconds the redness seems to vanish the reaction
slows and the walls of the flask become clear/
<p>Add another blast of heat&nbsp; and inject another 2 ml of water, the
reaction bubbles and fizzes slightly indicating it is basically dead, the
whole reaction took place in 5-10 minutes and produced 10 grams of some
excellent speed.
<p>Had&nbsp; 10-15 ml of water been added before the RP, the reaction would
not fire spontaneously.
<br>but you could reflux it for several hours and it would eventually turn
,
<br>you could lightly boil it in an open flask releasing water and HI until
it thickened 1-2 hours and you would have meth
<p>the reaction mechanism is the same.
<p>Individual steps
<br>---------------
<br>P4 + 6 I2 -> 4 PI3
<br>4PI3 +4 I2 ->4 PI5
<br>4PI5 + 16 H2O -> 4 H3PO4 + 20 HI
<p>10 E-OH + 20 HI &lt;-> 10&nbsp; E-I + 10 H2O + 10 H I
<br>10 E-I +&nbsp; 10 HI&nbsp; -->> 10 M-H + 10 I2
<p>Overall reaction
<br>------------------
<br>P4&nbsp; + 10 I2 + 16 H20 + 10 E-OH --> 10 M-H&nbsp; + 10 I2&nbsp;
+ 4 H3PO4&nbsp; +&nbsp; 10 H20
<br>not that simple is it
<p>Where
<br>P4 = red phosphorous
<br>I2 =&nbsp; crystal iodine
<br>E-OH= ephedrine
<br>E-I = iodated Ephedrine or iodated&nbsp; pre meth
<br>M-H= methamphet.
<p>Water is used up
<br>P4 is turned into phosphate and lost
<br>Iodine is restored&nbsp; (the actual catalyst) except it is part of
the reaction.
<p>What can be said about what promotes and what retards the reaction
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>More P4 creates more HI
<br>More HI pushes the reaction to the right
<br>P4 absorbs water pushing the reaction to the right
<p>So the Phos uses whatever water it can
<br>find to make HI from I2
<br>And pushes the reaction to completion.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>So What??
<br>Who cares about&nbsp; that stuff ?
<p>To get the reaction to fail do this:
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>Too much water, or too little water
<br>Too little Phos
<br>Too little HI or I2
<p>A sucessful reaction has this:
<br>--------------------------------
<br>Just the right amount of water
<br>Slight excess of Iodine
<br>Lots of Phosphorus
<p>For those who wish to exercise control over the rate of the reaction:
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>The rate of the reaction can be controled by the amount of water it
is supplied. By adding water a little at a time, the reaction rate can
be increased or decreased
<br>&nbsp;or by
<br>The amount of Phosphorous added
<br>or by the amount of iodine added
