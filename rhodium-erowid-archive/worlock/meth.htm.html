PUSH/PULL METHOD</font></font></font></u></b></h2></center>
<a href="toc.html"><img SRC="tocbut.jpg" BORDER="0" height="32" width="32"></a>
<br>This is methheads original report uncut,&nbsp; word for word, the only
modifications were to clarify and add some corrections he posted at a later
date&nbsp; concerning the ratios, and punctuation to make it more readable
since the BBS format is now a letter style.
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Step 1- Prepare pseudo</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">Start with your pills, crush them in a grinder.
Put the powder into a large washed out Gatorade jug. Make sure you wash
jug with distilled water only. One thousand 60-mg pills will yield 1 ounce
of chili, at a 50% return. Next, add distilled water to the powder, and
shake. Let settle for a minute or two, and siphon off the water.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Repeat steps, until you cannot taste the
pseudo anymore. The pseudo has a bitter taste to it. Now, make sure that
you filter the liquid through coffee filters until the liquid is completely
clear.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">When you have achieved this, boil it down
until its real low and put on medium heat. Continue cooking it down, until
your pseudo starts drying out, and then finish with a blow dryer. Remember
not to burn your pseudo. Scrape the powder into a small pile, and put into
another washed out Gatorade jug.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Then add Methanol. You will notice that a
binder comes out with the methanol, but was clear in the water. Siphon,
and filter, until this is clear. I use about eight bottles of Heet brand
methanol for every 4000 pills. Again, filter until clear, then put on stove
and boil. This time, use a fan to blow on the top of your glass bowl to
make sure it doesn't spill over and catch fire. Do the same thing that
you did with the first batch, low heat, and blow dry. Now you’ll have pure
Pseudo. The reason for the water pull is to make sure you remove all the
wax, that the wax is completely soluble in methanol.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">I forgot to mention that when using the water,
make sure it is ICE cold. Then, the methanol will bring out the last binder,
which is soluble in water.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Step 2- push pull tanks</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">Okay, now you should have your pseudo ready
to go, just remember the ratios that I give you. Okay. Now to make the
push/pull, the best thing about it, is the fact that since it's enclosed,
there is no smell and the process only takes an hour or so.</font></ul>

<ul><font face="MS Sans Serif">Take two 2,5&nbsp; gallon plastic gas cans.
Tape them together with duct tape, so that the can sit side by side. Next,
take the nozzles from the gas cans and attach them together. Usually, I
cut the end off one, and stick the other into it. Then I hot glue them
together, to seal them. So then, you attach them back onto the cans. This
allows water from one side, to enter the other side. Make sure that you
screw them back on tight, and that your seal is air tight, so that when
you stand them up on their ends, water and/or air does not leak out. Next,
take the can on the right side and attach a clear PVC tubing onto the air
inlet of the gas can.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">This you use to run into a sink, or shower,
or empty container, because sometimes iodine water will get pushed out
from the reaction. Make sure you use a hose clamp and hot glue to secure
it tightly. Next, take the can on the left, and attach a clear, BRAIDED,
hose to the air inlet. This hose will be attached to the stopper on the
flask. It has to be braided, so that it will not collapse when the heat
and pressure build up on the final reaction phase. Make sure that you use
a hose clamp, and some hot glue to attach, because you do not want it to
come loose.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Once this is down, fill one of the gas&nbsp;
cans&nbsp; with 2-1/4 gallons of distilled water. Then stand the gas cans
on end, so that the air inlets are up, and the U connection you made with
the spouts are on the bottom. Attaching the hose to the stopper can be
a bit tricky.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">I use a threaded PVC connector. PVC will
not deteriorate from the acids, or the heat. There's a special name for
the type of connector I use, so it would be best if I go find out what
it is and let you know, because the way it's threaded, it won't get pushed
out of the stopper. You can build this setup for around 30 American dollars
from parts at home depot. I shall return later with the name. Anyway, after
you have connected the hose to the stopper, you are almost ready to go.
The reason you have distilled water in the cans is so that you can create
a pressure. The push comes from the contents forcing out oxygen, the pull
comes from a complete hydrogen state, and after the final reaction, it
tries to "breathe" back in oxygen. Use distilled water, because sometimes
the pull is so hard, that it actually sucks water, back into the flask.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Step 3 - mix and react</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">It should&nbsp; cook&nbsp; only about one
to 1 1/2 hours, and if it never pulled, then it was never done. Here, this
might help answer the questions. I use a 4000 ml vacuum&nbsp; flask, because
it has a nipple on the side. I attach a clear hose to this nipple, with
a hose clamp, and pinch the hose closed with a pair of vise grips. Then
I am ready to get started.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">Here is the ratio.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;
Ephedrine</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;
I2</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">0.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;
RP</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">&nbsp;If you were to make less than an ounce
of chili, you&nbsp; use</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;
Ephedrine</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;
I2</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp; RP</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">Example:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">240 grams E,</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">240 grams I2</font></li>

<li>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">80&nbsp;&nbsp; grams of RP.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><br><font face="MS Sans Serif">Take the flask and first dump in the
R. Then, dump in the E. Add 3 small capfuls of distilled water. If you
are using re-used R, then add a small bump of hydrogen peroxide. Okay,
now this part is the best. Add in the I2, but be sure to hurry up and stopper
the flask. Then use duct tape to wrap around the stopper and neck of flask,
to ensure it does not pop off on you. Now, pick up the flask and stir the
contents.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Phase 1</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">Sometimes it is quick, and sometimes its
not, but the contents inside should start getting liquid. If it happens
quickly, the contents will appear to start to grow. Shake more; in order
to calm it down, because you do not want a fast reaction. You should notice
that the water is pushing, and air maybe coming out the right side gas
can. Keep stirring and shaking till the entire contents are liquid. If
you look inside the flask, you will notice tiny little sprinkles everywhere
in the mix. This is caused by the I2 reacting with the RP, and creating
Hydriodic acid. Keep your eye on it. You will notice that at first, you
have to stir the contents to calm it down. Then after about 15 minutes,
it calms down on its own. Then, you have to stir to keep the reaction going.
Let this stirring go on for about half an hour or so. Then, get a large
stainless steel stock pot, and one of those portable electric stoves. Make
sure you use the low burning side. I went ahead and tested my reaction
heat by getting a candy thermometer, and placing the stock pot on the stove
and turning it on, I’ve noticed that you don't ever want your heat to get
higher than 180 degrees, and that you should start cooking at 150 degrees.
Test your stove out before you cook, and look at the dial on the stove,
as to where the certain degrees are. Now, place the stockpot on the stove,
at 150 degrees, and place the flask in the pot. Pick up the flask every
few minutes and keep stirring, replacing the flask back in the pot. After
about half an hour of this, (making it 1-hour total cook time), turn up
the heat somewhat and keep the stirring process up. You will notice that
the contents will get liquid, and a yellow film will be inside.</font>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">The mix will look like it wants to grow
inside the flask. After a few more shakes, let it go you will notice that
more air and water will get pushed out of the gas can and the reaction
will get violent.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Phase 2</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">At this stage, I usually throw a towel over
the top of the flask, because I have had accidents before, like the hose
coming out of the stopper and contents are sprayed everywhere. When the
push/pull is a rocking away, then unplug the stove and let it go. When
the pushing has stopped, check the flask. The contents should have grown,
and filled the entire flask and a swirling green/white smoke should fill
the flask. If this did not happen, then it is not done. Plug back in the
stove, and let it go. This final reaction, is what turns your ephedrine
into Chili!&nbsp; What happens, is the contents reach a totally hydrogen
state. The last of the I2 has turned into Hydriodic acid and all the oxygen
gets pushed out of the flask. This is where you get the pull. Because the
Hydrogen State combined with heat creates a pressurized vacuum state. After
this final reaction has happened, let the flask cool down, and every 2
minutes, stir the contents. You do this, because when you stir up the contents,
you make sure that more ephedrine is turned into Chili. Then when the flask
has cooled down to a warm state, keep the nipple hose pinched, and release
the vice grips. Place a funnel into the hose, and add distilled water to
the funnel, then open the hose and let the water into the flask. Let air
get in through the hose because if you don't, then as soon as the water
hits the inside of the flask, the vacuum will pick up and suck water from
the push/ pull. Add more distilled water and remove the duct tape and stopper.
Shake the flask around, and pour the contents into a heavy Vision ware
bowl. Add more distilled water to the flask, to clean it out, and add to
the Vision ware. Next, place bowl on the stove, and put on high heat. Get
a plastic spoon, and wash with distilled water, to use to stir the mix.
Place a fan next to the stove to use to cool the bowl down. Stir the contents
to a boil, and remove from heat. Turn the fan on, onto the bowl, and let
cool down a bit. You will notice that all of your RP has dropped to the
bottom of the bowl, and it is ready to filter. You should have a golden
colored liquid. Filter, until all the RP is out of the liquid, and place
into a rubber maid "server" jug.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Step 4 - Clean up Chilli</font></u></b>
<br><font face="MS Sans Serif">This is the most important part, and if
you follow everything right, you won't even need to wash the shit. Trust
me, my chili has never needed washing YET! Almost never leaves a residue
in the pipe. Trust me. Where I live. I am just about number one in quality.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">I'll be chatting to TOAST about Picts. Okay.
Put the yellow colored liquid into the rubber maid server jug from Wal-Mart.
This is acid/chili water. Put in a small layer of ice (bag of ice bought
from any store, because it's all distilled), then add an equal portion
of Coleman fuel. If you don't use ice, you're going to get a volcano eruption
of lye/acid/Coleman's all over the place. When the lye hits the acid, it'll
heat up and create lot of pressure. The ice keeps this from happening,
until you shake up the container.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Next, add about 1/4 can of Red Devil Lye.
In mine, it takes about a 1/2 can. However, you don't want to overkill
the lye or you’ll lose everything. Now screw on the pop top lid, and shake,
with small towel over the top just in case of leakage. The jug should heat
up and expand, let settle for a second, and undo the pop top to let out
pressure, close, and repeat add more lye as you go along, until you get
a very strong cat urine/ammonia smell. When your nostrils have received
this little message, it's time to let the mix settle, and siphon. Take
a large Gatorade bottle, and poke a hole in the screw top. Next, wash out
the bottle, and cap thoroughly, using distilled water. Next, siphon the
Coleman's, into a filtered funnel, into the Gatorade bottle.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Now, you should have one Gatorade bottle,
with chili/Coleman's fuel in it. Add an equal amount of distilled water
to this. Then, shake the contents up. Always remember to cover the hole
in the top with your finger when shaking. Turn the bottle over, holding
the hole closed, and let settle, then with your other hand, grab a 3 way
pool test strip and place over a shot glass, then let a small amount of
water run over the pH part of the strip the color should be a violet blue.
Lots of chili in there folks, so, turn the jug upright again, and remove
cap. Next, we have to "push" the chili into the water.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">To do this, get some muriatic acid and a
small bottle with a dropper type top on it. Fill this with muriatic, and
add a small squirt into the bottle. If you look at the water when you do
this, you'll see the acid fall to the bottom, and quickly surface. However,
with the acid, you'll see ribbons of chili stay in the water. Cover the
hole with your finger again, and shake. Turn the bottle over, holding the
hole with your finger, and test again. Keep repeating this, until the pH
strip turns a reddish pink color. This is the pH level you need to keep.
The strip goes yellow, that means there's too much acid and there's nothing
you can do about it. At least not, if you haven't saved anything in your
shot glass, just take the water from the shot glass, and add it to the
jug, then retest. If the strip is okay, then replace a clean Vision ware
bowl on the stove, and drain the water into it. Be careful not to let the
Coleman's fuel fall into it, or your chili will be good, but tainted. If
some does get through, take lighter, and light the top of the water, and
the Coleman's will burn away. Now, turn it up to a boil, and wait until
you see it "cracking back". You should have the fan on it, to help it go
faster. When it starts to "crack back" lot, remove from heat, and place
the bowl in ice water. WARNING. Make sure it’s a Corning Vision Ware bowl.
The only glass bowl that I know of can go from extreme heat and cold. Other
glass bowls would shatter upon even touching the ice cold water. After
putting the bowl in ice water, make sure you get a blow dryer and blow
air into the bowl to help it dry. If it's liquid after 5 minutes, then
replace on the heat for a few more minutes and repeat. If you're too afraid
of hurting the chili, then just use the blow dryer to dry the rest of the
way.</font>
