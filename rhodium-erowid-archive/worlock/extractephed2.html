<P align="left">It is not easy to learn, but the first batch makes it worth all 
the effort . Once your set up, and have a proceedure you like, it is a cake 
walk. There is no simple, easy way. A lot of details have to be figured out. 
This is not a recipe, although some of the very best are included. Before the 
hive existed, there had never been free access to a database, that contained 
such information. This is a composite of that information, as seen through my 
eyes. Special attention was paid to the older procedures, because so much of the 
early work is not available, and it is important, to learn the secrets of those 
early alchemists.</P>
<P align="left">Eventually you will be able to design your own procedure. Yes, you 
will become that proficient, and knowledgable, many of you will make some 
discoveries that will be significant, there is so much more that needs to be 
uncovered. </P>

<P>The terms Sudafed - Pseudoephedrine - Ephedrine - E - sudo.&nbsp; Will be 
considered as similar when dreaming&nbsp; this document, although there is a 
difference in the physical properties of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, 
<BR>Pills are usually 30mg or 60mg,&nbsp; the time release are 120mg to 240mg of 
ephedrine / tablet </P>
<P>n many ways this is what it is all about the DEA has spent millions trying to 
gum up the works, by adding blockers, binders, and goos to ephedrine pills. This 
is where most failed reactions have the problem,&nbsp; " stuff in the 
ephedrine." </P>
<P><U>Pseudo-ephedrine is sold in two forms both are salts</U> <BR><B>1. 
Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (HCl )</B> - This is what you want until you 
graduate from the New Bee class <BR><A href="extractephed2.html#Sulfate"><FONT color="#000000"><B>2. Pseudoephedrine Sulfate(SO4)</B></FONT></A><FONT color="#000000"><B>- </B>has</FONT> to be changed&nbsp; to a free base state 
before it can be used <BR>Also the sulfate salt is only sparingly soluble in 
alcohol, so it must be extracted with water </P>
<P><B><U>Other shitty ingredients</U></B> <BR><FONT color="#ff0000"><B>Avoid 
</B></FONT><FONT color="#000000"><B>dreams containing</B></FONT><FONT color="#ff0000"><B> Methocel,&nbsp; Aspirin, Povidone, Acetaminophen, Triprilidine 
or Guaifenesin</B></FONT>- these substances&nbsp; require additional 
procedures&nbsp; to remove. <BR><FONT color="#000000"><B><U>Methocel</U></B></FONT> <BR><FONT color="#000000">The use of 
plastics cellulose-polyvinyl-foods and synthetic foods has finally breached the 
AB because these are soluble in everything, one cure is "The Cure" heating the E 
or chili with Toluene then removing the toluene and plastics, this is done as 
many times as needed usually three to remove this food additive from the 
product. 
<P><FONT color="#000000">A second method for Methocel(not the same as 
microcrystalline cellulose), is to dissolve the pills in water, don't filter 
(because you can't) that is what methocel gums up. Freeze the mixture in ice 
cube trays, takes many hours.</FONT> <BR><FONT color="#000000">then one or two 
cubes at a time are placed in a filter as they melt the water and E melt first 
and pass through the filter, then the methocel melts and gums up the filter. The 
saddness is the methocel will still have trapped some E in it so save the filter 
goo, wash it with water and repeat the process.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT color="#000000">You can boil the methocel pills in water and screen off 
the scum that floats to the top , then freeze the water and filter , this works 
well.</FONT> <BR><FONT color="#000000">The scum is methocel and with lots of E, so 
save the scum, boil it, freeze, and filter again. It is safe to taste the scum 
for the presence of the bitter taste of E.</FONT> </P>
<P>One item rarely listed as an ingredient , even though it is the main filler 
of the pill is CaSO4 <BR>gypsm(wallboard), It is so commonly used as a filler it 
is not listed. It is not very soluble in water and alcohol, but it is a fine 
powder that can easily slip through coffee filters. For this reason, letting the 
pill solution settle, before filtering it,&nbsp; allows the gypsm to settle to 
the bottom, this helps the reaction and keeps your product&nbsp; sulfate free, 
which makes it much better. </P>
<P>Some brands of&nbsp; E are not found OTC, but are BTC <B><I>behind the 
counter</I></B>, in your dreams. SWIM will&nbsp; ask for it. These are the thin 
white tablets 60 mg /120 tabs or in each bottle.&nbsp; You will dream about them 
in pharmacies, Indian smoke shops, HEAD SHOPS, convenience stores, super 
markets,. vitamin stores. <BR>Dream of walking into a head shop and asking for 
"ephedrine", they will take care of the rest. <BR>When asked, what kind?&nbsp; 
Simply reply "What is the best selling?" <BR>If asked how many?&nbsp; reply, "As 
much as I can get" <BR>Remember that your whole family has nasal congestion, so 
it best to get as many as possible. <BR>Be prepared to spend about $2-$4 / gram 
- <BR>There are restrictions on amount of E you may purchase a day,&nbsp; 
It&nbsp; is approximately. <BR>4 bottles of 120 tablets&nbsp; 60 mg/tablets / 
store/day.&nbsp; (4btl x 120tab x .060gm) = 28.8 grams = $75&nbsp; Chili sells 
for $60 /gram </P>

Extraction of Ephedrine - Method I</U></B></FONT> </P>
<P>There are many ways to clean up the ephedrine pills depending upon what is in 
them. The following method is rather generic and will do the trick 85% of the 
time. It removes Waxes, solid fillers(Calcium-SO4) <BR>, magnesium stearate, 
Micro crystalline cellulose , lactose, Sodium starch glucolate, and numerous 
other things. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) common funnels - 
buy a set of various sizes plastic is usually OK 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) cotton balls - a bunch of them 
- one or two are put in the neck of the funnel 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) coffee filters - 4 are stacked 
together in the funnel <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) 
Denatured alcohol&nbsp; or Methanol 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Acetone - Hardware or beauty 
supply 1 gallon <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) Distilled 
water several gallons <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) <FONT color="#ff0000"><B>Vision ware</B></FONT> cook ware by Corning or&nbsp; Stove<FONT color="#000000"><B> top safe glass</B> bowls.</FONT> <BR><FONT color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) Several Carafes or flasks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10) Small fan- Clip-on anywhere 
type or whatever you have <BR>&nbsp;Evaporating is safest with Corning Vision 
ware. Vision ware will not break when heated or chilled. Corning also makes 
Pyrex. Not all pyrex is temperature resistant .Unless you use Vision ware you 
have a 90% chance that a bowl will shatter under the heat (very dangerous). 
Corning ware for use on the stove top is excellent but it is not clear(see thru) 
<BR>Avoid washing your glassware with soap, unless you rinse it over and over 
and over again. <BR>Use water, or acetone, or acetone and salt, the soap leaves 
a residue of sulfates </P>
<P>This is the most dangerous part of the entire process because of the fire 
hazard when evaporating the methanol or denatured and because of the acetone 
vapors. <BR>Look at it this way , It is not a matter of "if" you have a fire, it 
is "when" you have the fire. Will you be prepared. </P>

<OL>
  <LI>Take your time,&nbsp; let things settle well, 
  <LI>Pre- treat the filters by wetting them&nbsp; down first with the clean 
  solvent. then pour your solution through it. this prevents the filter from 
  soaking up very much of your solution containing E 
  <LI>Allow your powdered pills to dissolve in methanol or denatured alcohol, 
  for 4-8 hours,. 
  <LI>Coffee filters are really for shit, they work only sort a kin da. The 
  better filters are Melitta brand, green and red package, they are cone filters 
  and have smaller pores use two of them and fold them at the perforations The 
  new improved Melitta filter sucks they now have flavor pores in them (not 
  good) 
  <LI>When evaporating notice all the slick vapors coming off, maybe even a 
  little bit of smoke.&nbsp; Some of that vapor is ephedrine or chili, Say good 
  bye, as it boils away into thin air. 
  <LI>&nbsp;<B>IF YOU WALK AWAY , TURN OFF THE STOVE.&nbsp; </B>or you may burn 
  the shit out of the&nbsp; E 
  <LI>When you get near the end of the water, turn off the stove, turn it on for 
  only a few seconds or a minute ,at a time, if you brown or burn the E the 
  yield will suffer some. asnd the taste will suffer, major.The brown can be 
  removed with acetone washes or an a/b extraction 
  <LI><BR>If unsure if you have fully extracted the ephedrine is? do a taste 
  test. Take some of the original pill sediment, let it dry and taste a small 
  bit, if it has a lingering bitter aftertaste it still has ephedrine in it. The 
  alcohol is bitter but you won't taste it after a few seconds. The ephedrine 
  will still leave a bitterness in your mouth&nbsp; for several minutes

Place other end of tube in the fuel of coffee pot,. Hold coke bottle at a level 
lower than the coffee pot (for siphoning) one hard suck between finger and thumb
