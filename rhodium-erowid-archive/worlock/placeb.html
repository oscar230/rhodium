<br>Ok, this is an amalgamation of many peoples methods!
<br>I believe this to be the best, simplest, fastest, and cleanest method
for producing meth-amphetamine,
<br>in the highest yields possible for RP/I2/E reaction!
<br>Remember, each and every step gives small losses, and this method has
the least steps!
<br>It is a culmination of efforts by, Worlock, CHEMMAN, and maybe a few
tiny touches by me!
<br>I re-iterate, I don't want any congratulations except for the write-up
itself!
<p>You will need these things, and no substitutions allowed!
<br>If you can't get this shit, you ainï¿½t ready to make the best Go-Go
in town!
<br>This is a refinement of all methods, and the next step up from Push
Pull,
<br>But nobody should be discouraged from attempting this, as you will
probably find it easier!
<br>PH paper, isn't even necessary!
<p>This post is one method from <a href="http://hive.lycaeum.org/wwwthreads/perl/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=crystal&Number=24686&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">Go
to Whoah</a>!
<br>This post has to be followed from <a href="http://hive.lycaeum.org/wwwthreads/perl/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=crystal&Number=24686&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">GO
to Whoah!</a>
<br>Otherwise you can run into trouble, as povidone is not removed in this
extraction!
<br>It will be removed at the end! Each step was chosen to compliment the
next!
<br>Understand?

<a NAME="Extraction of pfed,"></a><b><u>Extraction of pfed,</u></b></h3>
Ok, this method will deal with the HCl salt of pfed, and a streamlined
version of "the cure"!
<br>All pills are dumped into a large jar and double the volume of methanol
poured on top!
<br>This is stirred vigorously and let to settle, in the fridge seems to
speed it up!
<br>After top methanol layer has cleared it is carefully decanted off.
<br>This procedure is repeated 3 times.
<br>All methanol pulls are put together and reduced on a hot plate.
<br>As methanol gets down to last little bit, it is taken off heat
<br>Then a portion of acetone, twice your remaining liquid is dropped in.
<br>This forces the pfed crystals to crash out.
<br>Then remaining liquid is carefully eared off.
<br>Now you have your crude/dirty pfed HCl.
<br>Next we will be doing successive toluene washes
<br>So put your pfed crystals in a pyrex (heat proof glass)
<br>Now add toluene to a safe level that can be lightly boiled on hot plate
<br>After about 5 mins boiling with stirring.
<br>Take off heat and let settle a minute.
<br>Now carefully pour off toluene into a filter to catch any remnants
of pfed that may follow.
<br>Now if you get the toluene that has our contaminants in it and add
some water
<br>You will see the crap crash from the toluene into the water
<br>This is the crap that came thru with the methanol pull!
<p>So as we continue to do multiple toluene washes,
<br>We will continue to test the toluene after pouring it off,
<br>To see how we are progressing with the cleanup!
<br>When we have reached a point where no crap comes out of the toluene,
<br>With the addition of water, then we are ready to try acetone!
<br>Usually about 3 boils in toluene, but of course it depends how much
your using!
<br>So, as before we will add a portion of acetone and boil lightly!
<br>Now when we pour off the acetone, we will add a tiny amount of water
and some NaOH
<br>This is our final test, when you do this and no crap falls out of acetone
you are ready!
<br>This will be the cleanest pfed you have ever seen, guaranteed!
<br>AND, yields should be >90% if your careful! 95% is good

<h3>
<a NAME="Reaction,"></a><b><u>Reaction,</u></b></h3>
Smallest reaction to be attempted, especially by new bees, is 1oz of pfed!
<br>So that even taking into account sloppiness, lack of experience and
losses along the way
<br>You should get some product!
<br>Ratios of reagents are,
<br>3:3:1 or 1:1:1/3
<br>ie.E:I:RP aka, equal amounts of Iodine and pfed, and a third as much
RP! Comprenda! This is calculated on a weight basis, and can be scaled
up or down as necessary, e.g.60gmE/60gmI2/20gmRP or 120gmE/120gmI2/40gmRP
etc etc!
<p>Ok first prepare yourself an ice bath! Yes ice cubes and water in a
sink or bucket!
<br>Now, many will say you should add this first or that first!
<br>Well after much reading of different peoples methods, I say....
<br>Chuck the whole shebang in together, while your flask is on ice,
<br>Lift and swirl ingredients together, while maintaining on ice!
<br>Put your condenser on top and start water running thru, from bottom
to top!
<br>Now, the idea is to get the reaction going in the most controlled way
possible.
<br>Now you want to let reagents react in the ice bath, if at all,
<br>Then move vessel from ice bath to room temp,
<br>If things look like they're going too fast, put back in ice bath,
<br>You want to keep the reaction going but only at a nice slow, controlled
pace!
<br>This is also necessary to control vapor in the condenser!
<br>Thick and or dis-colored smoke is bad! and plumes of smoke will escape
from condenser
<br>As things progress at a nice slow pace, as things slow too much you
can start applying heat!
<br>So prepare an oil bath and bring to about 50c, now if there is no more
action in your vessel
<br>You can move it to the oil bath, and same as before, when things slow
down,
<br>Adjust heat up, to say 100c then 150c for one hour, to make sure reaction
has completed
<br>The whole time you should be watching to keep a nice reflux going,
<br>and not too much vapor is escaping from condenser!
<br>Now remove from heat and disconnect condenser,
<br>Now add ice water to quench reaction,
<br>reason for ice water is to calm the reaction down when NaOH is added
<br>Now its up to you if you want to filter out RP or leave till the end
<br>I would leave it, it will be washed nicely by next process and be easier
to filter!
<br>Now add lots of NaOH to bring reaction mix to positive 14PH
<br>You cannot over-basify as meth won't be destroyed, its a tough MF!

<a NAME="Steam"></a><b><u>Steam Distillation,</u></b></h3>
<b><u></u></b>
<p><br><img SRC="http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/worlock/ssd.jpg" BORDER="3" height="296" width="723" align="LEFT">Now
you need to set up your glassware for steam distillation!
<br>So attach steam distillation sloping splash head to top hole of flask!
<br>Now attach plastic hose to steam inlet and other end,
<br>on release valve of pressure cooker that is full of water!
<br>Now attach condenser on end of splash head, and rig up some kind of
prop for it to stay up!
<br>Now place a jar at the end of condenser to catch our distillate!
<br>Now you want to heat both the pressure cooker, and the reaction flask!
<br>Now sit back and get ready for one of the most beautiful sites and
smells!
<br>The meth free base that is sitting on the top of your aqueous layer
in flask
<br>will vaporise and be carried across and be condensed in the condenser
and trickle down into your jar
<br>It will sit atop a bottom layer of water!
<br>After the last of the oil has come across, change jars and leave the
setup to run for another hour
<br>Just to make sure you got it all!
<br>Any povidone from the pills will be stuck behind in the reaction vessel
<br>It has been noted that some polymer that may have been left from extraction,
may follow the steam!

<h3>
<a NAME="Crystallization,"></a><b><u>Crystallization,</u></b></h3>
So, now we have a jar of water, with this sweet clear oil sitting on top!
<br>Now options are to add HCl acid slowly with stirring until oil layer
disappears
<br>and then evaporate the whole lot to get crystals!
<br>Or, as I found, you may have some polymer that has come over with the
steam
<br>and is now sitting in the water layer, and it looks cloudy!
<br>So I don't want to evaporate all that, it will just concentrate the
shit in there
<br>(plus its very time consuming evaporating water, plus you risk losing
some meth as the water evaporates)
<br>So, I think you should just throw a little toluene into jar,
<br>and then separate!
<br>Now your absolutely pure meth free base is in your toluene!
<br>Now you can either gas, for instant clean meth, or
<br>Add minimal DH2O and then acidify to PH7, shake, separate and evaporate
water for crystals!
<br>repeat this step if you do it this way, as some more may come in second
go!
<br>Now with this process from start to finish, you shouldn't need to re-crystallize
<br>As your product should be the cleanest shit anybody has ever seen anyway!
<br>But you may want to for the purpose of growing nice big crystals!
<br>In which case, add just enough hot methanol to dissolve all your meth
<br>and then place in freezer.
<br>The secret is, the slower the evaporation, the bigger the crystals!
<br>So a nice slow room temp evaporation over several days might be fun!
<p>Enjoy, and do not attempt anything above, before you completely understand
what you are doing!
<br>You must have a sound understanding of the basics first!
<p>One Pissed Bee!
